      "The region under consideration here is made up of at least three different areas, partially recognised as such in antiquity: Iberia, Southern Gaul and the island of Corsica. The only common elements characterising these different areas are colonisation by Phokaia (no. 859 ) and the fact that both Iberia and southern Gaul were,at least to some extent, within the area dominated commercially and possibly politically by Massalia (no. 3 ). Moreover, these areas mark the westernmost limit of the Greek presence in the Mediterranean. ¹ Although Greek contacts with Tartessos in Iberia are attested  for  C 7 l  by  Herodotos' mention  of Kolaios' voyage ( 4 . 152 . 2 ) and for C 7 l/C 6 e by his mention of Phokaian travellers ( 1 . 163 . 1 ), Greek poleis do not seem to have existed in Tartessian  territory, despite  the  offer  made  by  the  native king,Arganthonios,to the Phokaians,that they could establish themselves in his territory wherever they wished (Hdt. 1 . 163 . 3 )\n"

      "Alalie is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 1 . 165 . 1 ( ανεστήσαντο πόλιν ). The  name  of the  territory is unknown, but its extent, after C 6 m when the refugees from Phokaia arrived,has been calculated at 200 km ² (Gras ( 1985 ) 404 ), and it may have been divided into lots (Jehasse and Jehasse ( 1987 ) 380 ). The 'epoecised' city put a fleet of sixty ships to sea (Hdt. 1 . 166 . 2 ), which indicates a population of c. 20 , 000 inhabitants  (Gras  ( 1985 ) 400 -6 )  or  even  more (Domínguez ( 1985 ) 375 -76 ).\n",
      "\n",
      "Alalie was founded by Phokaia (no. 859 ), in accordance with an oracle, 20 years before the fall of Phokaia, i.e. c. 560 (Hdt. 1 . 165 . 1 ). In c. 546 the  Phokaians  decided  to  relocate their city in reaction to the Persian threat, and almost half of the  Phokaians  were  received  at  Alalie. From  the  Alalian point of view, the arrival of these refugees may have been perceived as reception of epoikoi , while from the point of view of the Phokaians it was a case of metoikesis (Demand ( 1990 ) 37 ). The refugees arrived with wives, sons and sacred objects from their home sanctuaries (Hdt. 1 . 164 . 3 , 166 . 3 ).\n",
      "\n",
      "After  a  naval  battle  with  the  Carthaginians  and  the Etruscans c. 540 , in which the Alalians were victorious but suffered severe losses, the city was perhaps dismantled (Hdt. 1 . 166 . 3 : ανέλαβον [. . .] καιgrave τηgraveν άλλην κτίσιν ), and certainly abandoned (Hdt. 1 . 166 . 3 : ανέλαβον ταgrave τέκνα καιgrave ταgraveς γυναῖκας [. . .] καιgrave έπειτα απέντες τηgraveν Κυacuteρνον έπλεον ες ' Ρήγιον ). However, the  abandonment  was  perhaps  not complete, as the existence of some archaeological remains dated  to  C 6 l  (and  antedating  the  foundation(?)  of the Etruscan city) would suggest (Jehasse and Jehasse ( 1982 ) 255 ; cf. Domínguez ( 1985 ) 376 -77 ). In any case, after the battle, Alalie ceased to be a polis and its site was subsequently occupied by an Etruscan city, whose cemetery (C 6 l-C 3 m) has been excavated (Jehasse and Jehasse ( 1973 )).\n",

Sol . 2 . 7 )  the  son  of Euxenos (Arist.); or  Kreontiades  (Antiochos  ( FGrHist 555 )  fr. 8 ); finally, Strabo 4 . 1 . 4 stresses the role of the Ephesian woman Aristarche  as ηasperγέ µ ων τουtilde πλουtilde , whatever  that  means (Malkin ( 1990 ) 51 -52 ). Similarly, there are different foundation myths for the city in Classical sources: marriage of the Greek oecist to the daughter of the native king (Arist. fr. 560 and Just. Epit . 43 . 3 . 4 -12 , with some variations); a completely different tradition,including the flight from Phokaia during the Persian conquest, is found in Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 8 and Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 72 . Strabo 4 . 1 . 4 gives details which may correspond to any of these traditions. Despite the marriage between the Greek oecist and the native king's daughter, which led to the foundation of the city according to Arist. fr. 560 , Massalia was always considered a Hellenic and not a mixed polis (cf. Ps.-Skylax 4 ; Livy 37 . 54 . 22 (r 189 )).\n",
      "\n",
      "The territory is called Μασσαλιώτις (Strabo 4 . 2 . 3 ); the toponym may also have been used to denote the territory (cf. Brunel  ( 1945 )); it  is  referred  to  as ηasper Μασσαλιωτῶν χώρα at  Arist. Mir. ausc . 837 b 8 (cf. Ps.-Skylax 4 )  and  is described as planted with olives and vines but poor in grain (Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 ). The territory of Massalia has been the subject of much discussion (Bats ( 1986 ) 17 -19 ; Morel ( 1986 )) and it is now supposed that throughout the Archaic and Classical periods Massalia possessed a territory of c. 70 km ² (Arcelin ( 1986 ) 74 ), territorial  expansion  taking  off only  in  C 3 (Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 ; Bats ( 1986 ); Arcelin ( 1986 ) 52 -75 ). In any case, there are hardly any archaeological traces of the occupation of the territory (Arcelin ( 1986 ) 47 ). Apart from controlling its  territory proper, Massalia seems to have founded, and kept  under  its  sway, a  network  of coastal  cities  (Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 , 9 ) with the intention of protecting the coast against incursions  of inland  barbarians. Leaving  aside  the  very problematic cases of the cities in Iberia (Emporion, Rhode, etc.), the beginning of this policy can be dated to C 5 l, which saw  the  foundation  of Agathe, and  its  continuation  is marked by the foundations of Olbia (C 4 s), Tauroeis (C 3 l) and Nikaia (C 3 l/C 2 e?), the  only  cities  for  which  we  have acceptable  dates  (Bats  ( 1986 ) 27 -30 ). The  way  in  which Massalia  controlled  these  foundations  is  incompletely known (Gschnitzer  ( 1958 ) 20 -26 ), although  in  general  it seems  that  the  majority  (or  all)  of them may have been dependent ' poleis founded as fortresses' in the typology of Hansen ( 1997 b ) 36 no. 12 ; however, in no case can polis status be proved, and accordingly each city is briefly described in the Introduction above.\n",

      "If we can trust Justinus' retrospective narrative, Massalia had a foedus and amicitia with Rome from the time of its foundation (Just. Epit . 43 . 3 . 4 , 5 . 3 ), completed in C 4 e with the granting to Massalia of immunitas and the establishment (or renewal?) of a foedus aequo iure (Just. Epit . 43 . 5 . 10 ; see Nenci ( 1958 ) 63 -97 ). Massalia sent envoys to Delphi in C 4 e (Just. Epit . 43 . 5 . 8 ).\n",
      "\n",
      "The armed forces of Massalia, especially the fleet, were deployed on several occasions; thus, a naval defeat of the Carthaginians is reported for the very moment of the foundation (Thuc. 1 . 13 . 6 ; Paus. 10 . 18 . 7 ) as well as for later occasions  (Just. Epit . 43 . 5 . 2 ; Gras  ( 1987 )). On  land  Massalia waged wars against the natives from the foundation of the city (Just. Epit . 43 . 4 . 9 -11 , 5 . 1 ) and established a network of fortified places for protection against the native populations (Just. Epit . 43 . 3 . 13 ; Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 , 9 (C 4 ?)); cf. supra .\n",

      "It has been suggested that the total population of the city never exceeded 20 , 000 inhabitants (Bats ( 1992 ) 273 ). The existence of γένη , such as the Πρωτιάδαι , is attested for C 4 (Arist. fr. 560 ).\n",

      "Massalia had an oligarchic constitution (Arist. Pol . 1305 b 4 , 10 , 1320 b 18 , 1321 a 30 ); the enfranchised citizens are referred to as the politeuma , and access to the politeuma was by election of those found worthy of membership (Arist. Pol . 1321 a 29 -31 ). Aristotle  also  refers  to  an  undated stasis in Massalia by which the oligarchy was changed into a constitution that came closer to being a politeia , the positive variant of popular rule ( Pol . 1305 b 1 -4 ); perhaps its outcome is the eunomic aristocracy mentioned by Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 for his own day (or that of his informant(s)). Some Massiliote laws are referred to by Theophr. fr. 117 , Wimmer; Ael. VH 2 . 38 . 1 ; and  Livy 37 . 54 . 22 (r 189 ). These  laws  were  Ionic  ( νό µ οι ' Ιωνικοί ) and were exhibited in public (Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 ). Val. Max. 2 . 6 . 7 mentions the death penalty as having been used since the foundation of the city.\n",

      "Massalia had a council (interpreted as a senatus by Val. Max. 2 . 6 . 7 ) called the Six Hundred ( οιasper /asperΕξακόσιοι ), whose members served for life and were called τι µ ουacuteχοι ( I.Lampsakos 4 . 45 , 48 (C 2 e); Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 ); this council was presided  over  by  the  Fifteen  ( οιasper Πεντεκαίδεκα ; Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 ; Caesar, BCiv . 1 . 35 . 1 ), who were in turn controlled by the Three ( οιasper Τρεῖς ; Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 ), one of whom was chairman (Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 )  and  possibly  the  eponymous  magistrate, although this is not confirmed. There is no solid evidence for the existence of an assembly at Massalia; however, the existence of a demos may possibly be implied by the reference to the public exhibition ( δη µ οσίΩsubiotaα ) of the laws (Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 ), and IG  357 (C 1 ?) has sometimes been interpreted to prove the existence of a demos , but it is a problematic document: Properzio ( 1989 ) 296 -97 denies that it alludes to\n",

      "In C 2 , and almost certainly before, the agora of Massalia was situated in a low-lying area between the two main elevations of the city, Saint-Laurent hill and Moulins hill (Gantès ( 1992 ) 85 ). Although it has not been found, Massalia presumably had a temple dedicated to Athena, since Strabo 13 . 1 . 41 refers  to  its ξόανον just  as  Just. Epit . 43 . 5 . 6 (rC 5 ?) alludes to its simulacrum and to the porticus of the temple, situated on the arx . The city also possessed a ιasperερόν devoted to Apollo  Delphinios  and  a  temple  ( νεώς )  dedicated  to Artemis Ephesia, both on the άκρα (Strabo 4 . 1 . 4 ). A monumental  Ionic  C 6 l  capital  has  been  unearthed  (Benoit ( 1954 )), as has a set of fifty tiny C 5 e naiskoi with a seated goddess pertaining to two different sanctuaries (Clerc ( 1927 ) 227 -40 ); a possible C 4 e Thesmophorion has also been identified (Gantès ( 1992 ) 79 , 85 ). The water management system of the city was very elaborate, with cisterns, water reservoirs and drains, some of them dating to C 6 e (Trouset ( 1990 )). There is an epigraphical reference to a stadion (perhaps of Roman date: Benoit ( 1966 ) 20 ); from the foundation of the city  the  harbour  received  special  attention  and  many substantial structures related to it have been excavated, the oldest  ones  dating  to  C 6 l  (Guéry  ( 1992 ); Hesnard  ( 1995 ) 65 -78 ).\n",

The acropolis was perhaps encircled by a separate wall, different from that around the city proper according to Strabo himself ( 4 . 1 . 4 ; Tréziny ( 1994 ) 128 -29 , modified in Tréziny ( 2001 ) 49 ). Just. Epit . 43 . 4 implies the existence of walls from at least the second generation of colonists. There are remains of an early (C 6 l) city wall which already enclosed the area of the later city almost in its entirety; in C 4 a new defensive system was built and the previous wall razed to the ground at several points (Tréziny ( 1994 ) 125 -30 , ( 1995 ) 44 -45 , ( 2001 ) 45 -53 ).\n",

While some houses and other urban features are known from C 6 e, the general layout of the city is not fully known, though there is some evidence of C 6 m grid planning (Tréziny ( 1995 ) 50 ); perhaps the main axis of the city was constituted by the prolongation, inside the city, of the road that entered the city through the eastern gate and led to the agora.In C 4 f some quarters of the city had a regular plan (Gantès ( 1992 ); Moliner ( 2001 ) 101 -8 ).\n",

Also attested is the cult of Athena (Strabo 13 . 1 . 41 ), supposed  by  some  scholars  to  be  the  protective divinity of the city (Tréziny ( 1994 ) 129 -30 ). Massalia celebrated the Anthesteria (referred to by Just. Epit . 43 . 4 . 6 (rC 6 ) as Floralia ) and the Thargelia (Serv. ad Aen . 3 . 57 ; Lact. Plac. comm . ad Stat.

Paus. 10 . 8 . 6 -7 furthermore mentions a statue  of Athena  dedicated  at  Delphi  as  well as  one  of Apollo  ( 10 . 18 . 7 )  dedicated  to  commemorate  a naval victory over the Carthaginians; Just.

From C 5 m Massaliote  coins  became  more  similar  to  the  coins issued in Magna Graecia and Sicily, and down to C 4 e we can trace at least seven issues of obols weighing from 0 . 71 to 0 . 85 g, with types mainly reminiscent of those found in Sicily. Many of these issues carry the legend ΜΑΣ , ΜΑΣΣ or even ΜΑΣΣΑΛΙΩΤΑΝ (in  the  Doric  dialect; Brenot ( 1992 )). The  minting  of obols, although  progressively  of lower weight, continued until C 3 l (Brenot ( 1980 )). In C 4 e begins the minting of a new and short-lived coin, a drachm weighing 3 . 75 g (called a 'heavy drachm' to distinguish it from the 'light drachm' weighing 2 . 65 g issued from C 3 l). Issues of this coin ceased in 360 . It shows on the obv .

Tusa ( 1979 ); Bondi ( 1979 ); Huss ( 1985 ) 100 -23 ). During  this  conflict, Dionysios  I  rose  to power at Syracuse, and under his aegis a peace treaty was concluded with Carthage which secured the civic rights of Selinous, Himera, Akragas  and  Gela. However, conflicts continued throughout C 4 e, with changing outcomes, and resulted in vast programmes of resettlement of the inhabitants of destroyed cities and the settling of mercenaries at cities  such  as  the  newly  founded  Tyndaris  (McKechnie ( 1989 ) 35 -42 ).

After  the  troubled  interlude  of Dion  and  Dionysios  the Younger, and further conflicts with Carthage, Sicily experienced a significant revival in the 340 s, when Timoleon of Corinth put an end to tyrannies, brought in new settlers, relocated citizens from destroyed cities, and refounded e.g. Megara,Gela,Akragas and other cities (Sordi ( 1961 ); Talbert ( 1974 )  esp. 146 -60 ; Mossé  ( 1999 )).

A dry-stone circuit  wall  in  indigenous  technique is attributed to a C 6 m Heled phase; a later reinforcement is attributed to the period of Timoleon.A small C 6 e shrine is mixed native and Greek  according  to  its  structural  details  and  finds. The indigenous  tombs  were  replaced  by  Greek-type  trench tombs in C 6 l. The few undisturbed graves have yielded Attic vases and a fragment of a terracotta statuette of Demeter.

The site occupies an extensive plateau with habitation areas, sanctuaries and cemeteries distributed over five separate hill-tops and adjacent slopes. The  settlement  has  been  identified  with Omphake, or Maktorion, or Galeria (no. 16 ) or simply as a Greek settlement of unknown identity (Spigo ( 1979 ), ( 1986 ) 20 ). A recent suggestion identifies the site with Leontinoi's foundation of Euboia (no. 15 ), and the interpretation of the site  as  Chalkidian  is  supported  by  epigraphic  evidence ( infra ). A  monumental  building  has  been  interpreted  as public or 'administrative' , an interpretation supported by the finds from the building which include C 6 e fragments of a law code pertaining, inter alia , to homicide, written in the Chalkidian alphabet and tentatively associated with the lawgiver Charondas (Cordano ( 1986 b ) 41 ; IGDS no. 15 ). C 7 -C 6 habitation remains reveal some regularity of orientation, and some of the structures are remarkable for their typology (houses of pastas type) and for their contents (Lagona ( 1973 ) 297 ; Spigo ( 1986 )). Apart from habitation, the buildings also served as workshops and magazines for the production of pithoi and arulae , which suggests the presence of a temenos of Demeter (Spigo ( 1979 ) 31 -32 ).

      "Vassallaggi Settlement  south-west  of Caltanisetta  in  the Salso valley, c. 40 km north of Licata (ancient Phintias). The identity of the site is unknown, but it is often identified with Motyon (so Barr .). The Greek influence in this originally indigenous settlement commenced in C 6 e (De Miro ( 1962 ) 143 ; cf. Miccichè ( 1989 ) 56 , 183 with refs.), and may be connected with the foundation of Akragas (no. 9 ) in 588 . The increasing  Helation  should  probably  be  seen  against the  background  of the  Akragantine  expansion  under Phalaris (De Miro ( 1962 ); Berve ( 1967 ) 130 ; Luraghi ( 1994 ) 254 -55 ). A  regular  urban  layout  is  attested, with  houses raised  on  terraces, and  a  single  wide plateia dividing the habitation area into two sections (De Miro ( 1980 ) 723 -24 ). C 5 m destruction levels have been interpreted as testimony (ibid.)  that  the  city  was  Motyon, which  was  taken  by Douketios in 451 (Diod. 11 . 91 . 1 ). The revitalisation of the site (ibid.; cf. Merighi  ( 1963 ))  would  in  that  case  reflect  the reconquest of Motyon by Akragas (Diod. 11 . 91 . 4 ). A temenos with a naiskos and altar is known from the habitation area; the votive remains seem to point to a cult of Demeter and Persephone  (De  Miro  ( 1962 ) 143 -44 ; Tusa  and  De  Miro ( 1983 ) 246 -50 ). An open space between temenos and gate is interpreted as an agora, and the overall urban layout shows similarities with the northern part of the Himera plateau. The  tomb  finds  from  the  cemetery  are  primarily  Greek (Orlandini  ( 1971 ); cf. Johnston  ( 1973 )). The  numismatic evidence  from  the  site  has  revealed  close  C 5 s  ties  with Akragas  (Merighi  ( 1963 )). Fischer-Hansen  ( 2002 ) 153 -57 .

      "In some cases it cannot be decided whether a settlement was Greek or indigenous; this is true even of settlements referred to by historical writers (e.g. Maktorion), but the difficulties involved in establishing the ethnic identity of a given settlement is nicely illustrated by settlements known from archaeological  evidence  and  not  securely  identified with an ancient toponym,such as Butera,Monte San Mauro and  Monte  Saraceno. ¹⁹ These  sites  present  a  very  strong degree of Helation and may possibly have to be identified  with  Greek  colonial  foundations  whose  sites  are unknown;e.g.Euboia (no. 15 ) may perhaps be at Monte San Mauro. However, they may also be the sites of Greek cities not  mentioned  by  the  written  sources, or  they  may  be indigenous communities, or communities of mixed ethnicity. Furthermore, although indigenous Sicilian settlements are normally fortified by means of earth and stone ramparts (Bonacasa Carra ( 1974 )), several of the sites in question date to  C 6 -C 5 , a period  when  these  sites  were  often  under Hellenic  influence. Special  circumstances  or  pressure  of time made it convenient also at Greek sites to employ this technique, for instance at Himera and Kamarina (Bonacasa Carra ( 1974 ) 94 , 115 -18 ). The characteristic type of Sicilian naiskoi erected in Sikel settlements are often indistinguishable from the buildings known from the sanctuaries in the Greek colonies, and Greek cults, above all that of Demeter and  Persephone, are  widely  attested  at  the  indigenous\n",
      "\n",
      "¹⁹ Settlements such as Monte Bubbonia and Monte Saraceno excavated in the 1950 s and 1960 s were defined as Greek poleis by their investigators, for instance by Adamesteanu: 'we now have evidence of the Helation of the interior regions, not only of the coast. These towns are characterised by their sanctuaries as  formally  Greek, and  no  longer  indigenous  settlements  backward  in  their development. We are confronted by real Greek centres, the result of a fusion of indigenous and Hellenic elements-they were poleis already in the first half of the fifth  century  and  not  just  insignificant  indigenous  settlements' (Adamesteanu ( 1956 ) 145 ). Some of the sites listed above may be connected with the  historical  cities  of Omphake, Maktorion, Kakyron  and  show  that  these played a political, an economic and a cultural role not dissimilar to that of the coastal cities. The interpretation of the early investigators has been taken up by later scholars, for instance by Uhlenbrock, who defines the settlements at Monte San  Mauro  and  at  Monte  Saraceno  as  anonymous  sub-colonies  of Gela (Uhlenbrock ( 1988 ) 122 -23 ); the term polis is used for all the Heled Sikelian settlements by Bonacasa Carra ( 1974 ) 103 ; cf.

      "\n",
      "It should also be noted that Greek influence and expansion  were  not  always  quietly  accepted  by  the  indigenous populations. In C 6 , the colonising expedition of Pentathlos of Knidos lost its leader when it supported Selinous in a war against Segesta (cf. Lipara (no. 34 )), and the expedition of Dorieus was crushingly defeated by Phoenicians (cf. Herakleia (no. 21 )).\n",

      "A number of the Sikel settlements in the interior listed above  reveal  a  high  degree  of Helation  by  the  early Classical period, the outcome of cultural change under the influence of the Greek cities on the coast. However, Greek influence, or even domination, crumbling under the pressures of internal strife,led to a C 5 f Sikel movement aiming at greater  political  autonomy. Such  a  movement  has  been linked  to  the  democratic  movements  within  the  Greek cities, for instance at Syracuse, where the democratic faction invited the Sikel cities to support  the  revolt  against Thrasyboulos (Diod. 11 . 68 . 1 (r 466 )).\n",

      "The  Sikel  leader  Douketios, variously  called hegemon , basileus or aphegoumenos ton Sikelon (Diod. 11 . 76 . 2 , 78 . 5 , 88 . 6 ), appears in the sources for the first time in connection with the collaboration between Sikel tribes and the democratic  party  in  Syracuse  in 461 / 60 . ²¹ After  the  fall  of the Deinomenids and the establishment of democratic rule at Syracuse there followed a period of internal consolidation and, with the help of Sikel tribes led by Douketios, Hieron's settlers were expelled from Aitna/Katane and the city was resettled with its former inhabitants (Diod. 11 . 76 . 1 -3 ). The Sikels had nursed a grudge against the inhabitants of Aitna since their occupation of Sikel land, and this land was now portioned out between themselves and the Syracusans.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Sikel  territory  remained  independent  of the Greek colonial cities, and Douketios founded a new city, Menainon (Diod. 11 . 78 . 5 (r 459 / 8 )), near  or  at  Menai, his birthplace (cf. Diod. 11 . 88 . 6 ), somewhere on the inland edge of the plain of Katane. Douketios also distributed land in Greek fashion and extended his authority inland by the capture  of Morgantina. Menainon/Menai are  unlocated, the latter possibly to be identified with modern Mineo; however, the  heartland  of Douketian territory  seems  to  have been the region of Caltagirone in central-eastern Sicily.\n",

      "Sikel self-assertion was by C 5 m strong enough to muster an uprising of the Sikel communities.A league of Sikel cities may have existed before Douketios, but it is attested in the sources for the first time during his rule. The Sikels entered into a Greek-inspired synteleia of'homoethnic'cities under the leadership of Douketios in 453 (Diod. 11 . 88 . 6 ), perhaps not merely a military alliance, though this is what Diodorus emphasises, but rather a wider economic and political collaboration (Manni ( 1976 a ) 201 ), and a new capital of the unified Sikels was founded  at Palike  (Diod. 11 . 90 . 1 ). Douketios modelled his foundations on the Greek polis -and cities such as Morgantina, Henna, Longane,Abakainon (for which see the entries below) and other centres listed above struck Greek-inspired autonomous coins from C 5 m. According to the sources, the synteleia excluded the city of Hybla, possibly because it was not considered a Sikel city proper but a city with a significant Greek element (Manni ( 1976 a ) 202 ).\n",
      "\n",
      "Syracuse and Akragas reacted to the growing influence of the Sikel movement. Douketios had led campaigns against Aitna/Inessa, the Dorian-Sikel settlement which had received the xenoi expelled from Aitne/Katane, and later a Sikel  anti-Akragantine  stance  led  to  the  capture  of the Akragantine phrourion Motyon. The threat to Akragas was averted with the help of Syracuse, which had been drawn into the conflict (Diod. 11 . 91 . 1 (r 451 )). ²² A year later the Sikel alliance  was  defeated  at  Nomai  by  the  Syracusans  and Motyon was regained by the Akragantines; several of the Sikel survivors escaped to scattered forts and Sikel settlements (Diod. 11 . 91 . 2 -4 ). Douketios, who had given himself up to the Syracusans, was sent into exile at Corinth (no. 227 ) (Diod. 11 . 92 ). However, with  the  probable  connivance  of Syracuse, which wanted to control Sicily's Tyrrhenian coast, he returned a few years later with a contingent of Greeks to found the city of Kale Akte, in collaboration with Archonides, the ruler of Herbita (Diod. 12 . 8 . 2 (r 446 )). The foundation was seen by Akragas as evidence of Syracusan territorial ambitions and as a breach of the treaty between the  two  cities. In  the  ensuing  battle, Syracuse  defeated Akragas (Diod. 12 . 8 . 2 -4 ), but Douketios and the Sikel movement gained little advantage. The death of Douketios in 440 hindered the establishment of new alliances and put an end to the Sikel movement (Diod. 12 . 29 . 1 ). Syracuse successfully stifled Sikel independence and subjugated the Sikel cities; only the city of Trinakie offered resistance (Diod. 12 . 29 . 2 -4 ); this city is otherwise unknown and is possibly to be under- stood as a symbolic name for a Sikel alliance, though it has also  been  identified  with  the  cities  of Palike  or  Piakos (Manni ( 1981 ) 237 -38 ; Loicq-Berger ( 1967 ) 212 ). Heavy tributes were imposed on the Sikel cities subject to Syracuse (Diod. 12 . 30 . 1 (r 439 ); Thuc. 6 . 20 . 4 ), but the settlements of the  interior  retained  their  independence  (Thuc. 6 . 88 . 4 ). There  are  even  traditions  of democratic  institutions, for instance  the ekklesia at  the  indigenous  site  of Kentoripa (no. 31 ) (Diod. 13 . 83 . 4 (r 406 )).\n",

      "The  Sikels  took  the  side  of Athens  during  the  first Athenian expedition to Sicily in 415 (Thuc. 3 . 103 . 1 , 4 . 25 . 9 ); for the subsequent alliances of the Sikels and Athens,and for the military help offered by the Sikel cities, see Thuc. 6 . 45 , 62 . 5 , 88 . 4 and 7 . 57 . 11 ; Archonides of Herbita is specifically called a philos tois Athenaiois by Thuc. 7 . 1 . 4 . Later, during the Carthaginian-Greek  conflicts, the  Sikels  supported  the Carthaginians (Diod. 13 . 59 . 6 (r 409 ), 14 . 7 . 5 (r 404 )), though some Sikel tribes supported the Greek cities (Diod. 13 . 86 . 5 ). A number of indigenous cities obtained autonomy as an outcome of these conflicts,but most were later resubjugated by the Syracusans under Dionysios I. The Helation of the Sikels gathered further momentum and is finally reflected in the C 4 Timoleontic refoundations of Greek cities on several of the originally Sikel sites.\n",
