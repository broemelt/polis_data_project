      "Massalia  (no. 3 )  itself, a  foundation  of c. 600 . However, archaeological evidence suggests the possibility of pre-colonial contacts between Greeks and indigenous populations, e.g. the three cups and the oenochoe of C 7 l from the indigenous cemetery of Le Peyrou, near the place where Agathe ( infra )  was  later  founded  (Nickels et  al . ( 1981 ); Nickels ( 1989 )), and  the  sporadic  finds  of C 7 l  Greek  pottery  at Mailhac (Gailledrat ( 1997 ) 69 -70 ).\n",

      "However, the  foundation  of Massalia  marked  the  real beginning of Greek presence and expansion in the region, an  expansion  that  was  basically  a  coastal  phenomenon; besides, the expansion of Massalia was a long-term process running from C 6 to the beginnings of the Roman occupation  of the  region. Massaliote  activity, moreover, varied from period to period: during C 6 and C 5 e it was directed towards  the  development  of commercial  interests  (Bats ( 1988 )), whereas from C 5 l/C 4 e it aimed primarily at establishing greater territorial control through the foundation of colonies and fortified centres. Such settlements are, obviously, of greater interest to our sources and are described below. Whether any of the settlements founded by Massalia in this period, and presumably dependent on it, can be considered poleis (albeit dependent poleis ; cf. Hansen ( 1997 b )) is uncertain: some may have been poleis , but in no case does the  evidence  warrant  inclusion  in  the  Inventory, which includes only two possible Massaliote foundations: Emporion (no. 2 ) and Rhode (no. 4 ). Of these, Emporion certainly  and  Rhode  possibly  were  founded  prior  to  C 4 . According to ancient writers,Massalia's reason for founding these settlements was the need for defence against the barbarians living in the direction of Iberia as well as towards Liguria (Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 ); trade interests or the wish to control the coastline may have provided an additional reason (as implied by Strabo 4 . 1 . 9 , 10 and 4 . 6 . 3 ).\n",

Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 -6 calls it a polis and an epiteichisma founded by Massalia ( κτίσ µ α Μασσαλιωτῶν ; cf. Plin. HN 3 . 33 : Agatha quondam Massiliensium ) for protection against the barbarians living in the direction of Iberia.It may have been a  ' polis founded  as  a  fortress' ( 12 )  in  the  typology  of Hansen ( 1997 b ). Archaeology has revealed two phases of occupation; in the earlier phase Agathe was probably only an empo- rion , and remains of C 6 -C 5 f houses of mudbrick seem to belong to it; to the later 'Massaliote' phase from C 5 l belong houses with stone basements and mudbrick walls. It seems that the city had a grid plan in this phase. The C 5 l city covered 4 . 25 ha  (Nickels  ( 1983 ) 421 -22 , ( 1995 )). At  least  two phases of the circuit wall have been established, the oldest dating to C 6 , and showing repairs during C 5 (Nickels and Marchand ( 1976 ); Nickels ( 1982 ) 273 -74 ). The territory of Agathe was divided into plots from at least C 4 e; its area has been estimated at c. 20 , 000 ha, partly devoted to agriculture, and containing at least 1 , 500 kleroi (Clavel-Lévêque ( 1982 ); García ( 1995 )).

Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 includes  it  among  the epiteichismata set  up  for  defence against the barbarians and describes it as one of the poleis of the Massaliotes ( 4 . 1 . 9 ). In 155 / 4 Antipolis certainly belonged to Massalia (Polyb. 33 . 8 . 1 ), and it still belonged to Massalia prior to 49 (Strabo 4 . 1 . 9 ; Gschnitzer ( 1958 ) 24 ), but its status in the Archaic or Classical period is unknown. The ancient city  of Antipolis  must  be  somewhere  below  modern Antibes; however, the  relatively  abundant  Archaic  finds (Clergues ( 1969 ); Ducat ( 1982 ) 89 -90 ) must belong to the native village; the remains of the supposed Archaic Greek city  are, consequently, unlocated  so  far  (Bats  ( 1990 )).

It is undoubtedly to be identified with modern Avignon, assigned by Strabo 4 . 1 . 11 and Plin. HN 3 . 36 ( Avennio ) to the Cavares. The reason for its designation as a 'city of Massalia' must be sought in the close links that the Gauls of this region maintained with Massalia  (Clerc  ( 1927 ) 242 -43 ; Barruol  ( 1975 ) 233 -44 ).

The size of the city suggests that its population cannot have exceeded c. 1 , 000 persons (Coupry ( 1974 ) 196 ), i.e. between 200 and 240 citizens of military age, which would amount  to  an  infantry  battalion  or συacuteνταγ µ α (Coupry ( 1986 ) 397 -99 ).

Clerc  ( 1927 ) 247 -49 ); finally, it  has  been  suggested  that  Massaliote Troizen in Italy cannot be other than the city of Poseidonia (cf. Morel ( 1992 ) 20 -21 ), neighbouring on and supposedly closely related to Phokaian Hyele (no. 54 ), in its turn apparently  closely  related  to  Massalia  (Ps.-Skymnos 250 : καιgrave Μασσαλιωτῶν Φωκαέων τ ' ' Ελέα πόλις ).

      "## 3 . The Mediterranean Coast of Spain\n",
      "\n",
      "The Greeks referred to the coast of the Iberian peninsula by the generic name ' Ιβηρία , a term which, as time went on, ended up as the name of the whole peninsula (Strabo 3 . 4 . 19 ). The name Iberia seems to have been coined by the Greeks to designate the westernmost places in the Mediterranean visited by them since C 7 l; it presumably derives from the name of the river Hiberos; however, the name Hiberos was applied to several  rivers  of the  Iberian  peninsula  in  antiquity (Domínguez ( 1983 ); Jacob ( 1988 ); Gailledrat ( 1997 ) 35 -36 ), and this fact may explain the different and sometimes contradictory views which ancient writers hold on the extent of Iberia (cf. Strabo 3 . 4 . 19 ). However, even if Herodotos ( 1 . 163 ) still distinguishes between Tartessos and Iberia, the C 5 l historian Herodoros of Herakleia (( FGrHist 31 ) fr. 2 a) includes within Iberia all of the coast between the western end of the peninsula and the river Rhône, and so Strabo's definition of Iberia  may be valid from C 5 l  onwards: οιasper δεgrave νυtildeν οasperacuteριον αυτηtildeς τίθενται τηgraveν Πυρήνην ( 3 . 4 . 19 ).\n",

      "If the  late  and  hardly  reliable  references  to  Rhodian colonisation in Iberia (see Rhode (no. 4 ) with Domínguez ( 1990 )  and  Santiago  ( 1994 b ))  are  disregarded, the  only Greeks to frequent Iberia seem to have been the Samians and, above all, the Phokaians (Hdt. 4 . 152 , 1 . 163 . 164 ; Domínguez ( 1991 a ), ( 1996 ) 26 -31 ). Archaeological evidence for  the  earliest  contacts, of C 7 l/C 6 e, is  found  at  e.g. the Tartessian  town  of Onoba  (modern  Huelva; Cabrera ( 1988 -89 )), at  the  Phoenician  city  at  Cerro  del  Villar (Cabrera ( 1994 )) and at the Iberian village at the location where  Emporion  was  eventually  founded  (Aquilué et  al . ( 1998 ) 24 -25 ). However, these early contacts did not lead to the foundation of Greek poleis : only Emporion developed the structures of a polis and then only several decades after the initial contacts between Greeks and natives. The Greek settlements  in  Iberia  were  foundations  of the  Phokaians (no. 859 ) or, perhaps, of the Phokaians from Massalia (no. 3 ); at  least, it  seems  that  Massalia  ended  up  controlling, probably both economically and politically, a major part of the coastal regions of Iberia.\n",

Geog . 2 . 6 . 14 . It  remains unlocated,although many suggestions have been advanced for its site (García y Bellido ( 1948 ) 58 -59 ); recently, Rouillard ( 1991 ) 303 -6 has suggested that it may be on modern Santa Pola, where excavations have revealed a (native) fortified settlement of C 5 s and finds show strong Greek influences (Moret et al .
