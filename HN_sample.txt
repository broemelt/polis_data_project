Massalia  (no.  )  itself, a  foundation  of c.  . However, archaeological evidence suggests the possibility of pre-colonial contacts between Greeks and indigenous populations, e.g. the three cups and the oenochoe of C  l from the indigenous cemetery of Le Peyrou, near the place where Agathe ( infra )  was  later  founded  (Nickels et  al . (  ); Nickels (  )), and  the  sporadic  finds  of C  l  Greek  pottery  at Mailhac (Gailledrat (  )  - ).

However, the  foundation  of Massalia  marked  the  real beginning of Greek presence and expansion in the region, an  expansion  that  was  basically  a  coastal  phenomenon; besides, the expansion of Massalia was a long-term process running from C  to the beginnings of the Roman occupation  of the  region. Massaliote  activity, moreover, varied from period to period: during C  and C  e it was directed towards  the  development  of commercial  interests  (Bats (  )), whereas from C  l/C  e it aimed primarily at establishing greater territorial control through the foundation of colonies and fortified centres. Such settlements are, obviously, of greater interest to our sources and are described below. Whether any of the settlements founded by Massalia in this period, and presumably dependent on it, can be considered poleis (albeit dependent poleis ; cf. Hansen (  b )) is uncertain: some may have been poleis , but in no case does the  evidence  warrant  inclusion  in  the  Inventory, which includes only two possible Massaliote foundations: Emporion (no.  ) and Rhode (no.  ). Of these, Emporion certainly  and  Rhode  possibly  were  founded  prior  to  C  . According to ancient writers,Massalia's reason for founding these settlements was the need for defence against the barbarians living in the direction of Iberia as well as towards Liguria (Strabo  .  .  ); trade interests or the wish to control the coastline may have provided an additional reason (as implied by Strabo  .  .  ,  and  .  .  ).

The following Greek settlements on the Mediterranean coast of France are mentioned by our sources.

Agathe ( /Alphalenisγ/alphaacuteθη ) Ps.-Skymnos  - seems  to  include Agathe in the π/omicronacuteλεις ' Ελλην/iotaacuteδες founded by the Phokaian Massaliotes  ( Μασσαλι/omegatildeται Φωκαε/iotatildeς ), although in  this passage, strictly speaking, polis is  not  used  about Agathe. Strabo  .  .  - calls it a polis and an epiteichisma founded by Massalia ( κτ/iotaacuteσ µ α Μασσαλιωτ/omegatildeν ; cf. Plin. HN  .  : Agatha quondam Massiliensium ) for protection against the barbarians living in the direction of Iberia.It may have been a  ' polis founded  as  a  fortress' (  )  in  the  typology  of Hansen (  b ). Archaeology has revealed two phases of occupation; in the earlier phase Agathe was probably only an empo- rion , and remains of C  -C  f houses of mudbrick seem to belong to it; to the later 'Massaliote' phase from C  l belong houses with stone basements and mudbrick walls. It seems that the city had a grid plan in this phase. The C  l city covered  .  ha  (Nickels  (  )  - , (  )). At  least  two phases of the circuit wall have been established, the oldest dating to C  , and showing repairs during C  (Nickels and Marchand (  ); Nickels (  )  - ). The territory of Agathe was divided into plots from at least C  e; its area has been estimated at c.  ,  ha, partly devoted to agriculture, and containing at least  ,  kleroi (Clavel-Lévêque (  ); García (  )). Barr .  , AC.

Antipolis ( /Alphalenisντ/iotaacuteπολις ) Ps.-Skymnos  seems to consider  Antipolis  the  most  remote  of the  cities  founded  by Massalia ( α/upsilonlenisτ/omegatildeν [ sc . π/omicronacuteλεων ] /epsilonlenisσχ/alphaacuteτη ). Strabo  .  .  includes  it  among  the epiteichismata set  up  for  defence against the barbarians and describes it as one of the poleis of the Massaliotes (  .  .  ). In  /  Antipolis certainly belonged to Massalia (Polyb.  .  .  ), and it still belonged to Massalia prior to  (Strabo  .  .  ; Gschnitzer (  )  ), but its status in the Archaic or Classical period is unknown. The ancient city  of Antipolis  must  be  somewhere  below  modern Antibes; however, the  relatively  abundant  Archaic  finds (Clergues (  ); Ducat (  )  - ) must belong to the native village; the remains of the supposed Archaic Greek city  are, consequently, unlocated  so  far  (Bats  (  )). A Greek presence in Classical  times  can  be  proved  only  by Greek inscriptions, especially the verse dedication set up by one Therpon to Aphrodite in C  s ( IG   ; LSAG  no.  ; cf., however, the doubts expressed by Clerc (  )  on the circumstances of its discovery). Barr .  , AC.

*Athenopolis ( Athenopolis ) This place, qualified by Plin. HN  .  as Massiliensium , must  be  sought  on  the  coast between the Citharista portus (La Ciotat or, better, Olbia) and  Forum  Iuli  (Fréjus)  (Pompon.  .  ). Barr .  (StTropez?), HR.

Avenion ( Α/upsilonlenisενι/omegaacuteν ) Steph. Byz.  .  calls  it  a π/omicronacuteλις Μασσαλ/iotaacuteας ; he does not give any indication of his source, but it may be Artemidoros, as in the entry on Καβελλι/omegaacuteν (Cavellio; see infra ; cf. Brunel (  )  ). It is undoubtedly to be identified with modern Avignon, assigned by Strabo  .  .  and Plin. HN  .  ( Avennio ) to the Cavares. The reason for its designation as a 'city of Massalia' must be sought in the close links that the Gauls of this region maintained with Massalia  (Clerc  (  )  - ; Barruol  (  )  - ). Massalia  presumably  never  included  this  area  within  its

territory (Arcelin (  )), though some scholars have maintained this (Barruol (  )  - ). Barr .  , AC.

Azania ( /Alphalenisζαν/iotaacuteα ) Steph.Byz.  .  - states that, in addition to the region in Arkadia (cf. Nielsen and Roy (  )), there was a city called Azania which belonged to Massalia (he cites Philon of Byblos: /epsilonlenisacuteστι κα/iotagrave Μασσαλ/iotaacuteας /alphalenisacuteλλη , /omegaasperς Φ/iotaacuteλων ). The city has not been identified and although it might well be a site controlled by Massalia (Brunel (  )), we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that Stephanos or Philon made a mistake (e.g. by confusing Massalia with Mainalia, vel sim .?). Barr .  , unlocated, H.

Kabellion ( Καβελλι/omegaacuteν ) Steph. Byz.  .  calls it a π/omicronacuteλις Μασσαλ/iotaacuteας ; his source is Artemidoros' Geography . Strabo calls  it Καβαλλι/omegaacuteν (  .  .  ,  )  and  assigns  the  city  to  the Cavares, as does Plin. HN  .  ( Cabellio ). It is to be equated with modern  Cavaillon, and its relationship to the Massaliote dominion must be similar to that of Avenion (cf. supra ). Barr .  , HRL.

Kyrene ( Κυρ/etaacuteνη ) Among the poleis of that name mentioned by Steph. Byz.  .  - , one is assigned to Massalia. It is otherwise unknown,but Barruol (  )  has suggested identifying it with the site of La Couronne, where the quarries exploited by Massalia were located (Strabo  .  .  ). Barr .  , unlocated (La Couronne?), H.

Monoikos ( Μ/omicronacuteνοικος ) Strabo  .  .  describes it merely as a harbour ( λι µ /etaacuteν ), although in Steph. Byz.  .  it appears as a polis in  Liguria, accompanied  by  a  reference  to Hekataios (fr.  ). Not in Barr .; Hecat. fr.  indicates A.

Nikaia ( Ν/iotaacuteκαια ) This  is  one  of the poleis founded  by Massalia as a fortress ( epiteichisma ) for protection against the  barbarians  according  to  Strabo  .  .  , who includes it among the π/omicronacuteλεις τ/omegatildeν Μασσαλιωτ/omegatildeν situated between Massalia  and  the  river  Var  (Strabo  .  .  ; cf. Steph. Byz.  .  ; Plin. HN  .  ). The city existed in  (Polyb.  .  .  ), but  is  absent  from  Ps.-Skymnos  ; if we  accept  that Timaios is the main source for that passage in Ps.-Skymnos, Nikaia probably had not yet been founded by  (the date of Timaios' death; Bats  (  )  ,  , n.  ; Bats  and Mouchot (  )  ; Bats (  )  ). It provides the most interesting evidence as to the kind of control exercised by Massalia over its dependencies (Strabo  .  .  ; CIL V  ). It corresponds to modern Nice. Barr .  , AC.

Olbia ( ' Ολβ/iotaacuteα ) Ps.-Skymnos  mentions  Olbia  as a polis within the series  of cities  founded  by  Massalia  to the east, and Strabo  .  .  adds that Olbia was one of the epiteichismata founded by Massalia for protection against the barbarians. The archaeological evidence suggests that Olbia was a ' polis founded as a fortress' (cf. Hansen (  b )  ). The  earliest  city  wall  is  dated  to c.  - (Coupry (  )  - ; Bats et al . (  )  - ) and the city was laid out on a grid plan; it seems that Olbia was a square of  m ×  m (Coupry (  )  - ; Bats and Brenot (  )  - ). The size of the city suggests that its population cannot have exceeded c.  ,  persons (Coupry (  )  ), i.e. between  and  citizens of military age, which would amount  to  an  infantry  battalion  or σ/upsilonacuteνταγ µ α (Coupry (  )  - ). Olbia had an agrarian territory of  ha, distributed in lots already from C  m (Benoit (  )  - ). Several cult places and other public works have been excavated at the site. Barr .  , HRL.

Rhodanousia ( ' Ροδανουσ/iotaacuteα ) This is described as a polis founded by Massalia by Ps.-Skymnos  and perhaps by Strabo  .  .  , who also includes it among the epiteichismata designed  to  protect  Massalia  from  the  barbarians  living around  the  river  Rhˆ one. Steph. Byz. calls  it  both π/omicronacuteλις Μασσαλ/iotaacuteας (  .  ) and π/omicronacuteλις /epsilonlenisν Μασσαλ/iotaacute/Omegasubiotaα (  .  ). The foundation date of the city is unknown, and its identification  is  likewise  uncertain: some  scholars  have  suggested identifying it with the site known as Espeyran (Saint-Gillesdu-Gard) (Barruol and Py (  )  - ), though recently doubts have been expressed (Bats (  )  , n.  ; Py (  )  - ,  - ). Barr .  (Espeyran?), CHR.

Sekoanos ( Σηκοαν/omicronacuteς ) Leaning on the authority of Artemidoros, Steph. Byz.  .  describes  Sekoanos  as  a π/omicronacuteλις Μασσαλιωτ/omegatildeν ; however, we may be dealing here with a mistake by Stephanos ( π/omicronacuteλις instead of ποτα µ /omicronacuteς ?; so Barr .  , unlocated, H). It must be one of the rivers between the Rhône and Massalia, or even a waterway, perhaps the fossa Mariana (Barruol (  )  - ).

Stoichades Islands ( Στοιχ/alphaacuteδες ) Strabo  .  .  mentions these  five  islands  and  says  that  they  were  tilled  by  the Massaliotes, who in ancient times ( τ/omicrongrave παλαι/omicronacuteν ) had built a fort  ( φρουρ/alphaacute )  there  to  prevent  piracy. Steph. Byz.  .  merely  says πρ/omicrongraveς Μασσαλ/iotaacute/Omegasubiotaα . The  modern  name  is  Îles d'Hyères. Barr .  , CHRL.

Tauroeis ( Ταυρ/omicronacuteεις ) Tauroeis  was  one  of the  fortresscities ( epiteichismata )  founded by Massalia to protect the coast against inland barbarians (Strabo  .  .  ,  ); the defensive character of the site is stressed by Caesar ( B Civ.  .  .  ), who  calls  Tauroentum castellum Massiliensium (r  ). Artemidoros ( apud Steph.Byz.  .  ) places the foundation

in the time of the fall of Phokaia (i.e. c.  ). It is located at the modern town of Le Brusc, and it is generally accepted that the foundation of the city must be placed in C  l or C  e (Arcelin (  )  ; Bats (  )  ,  n.  ; Brien-Poitevin (  ); Bats (  )  ). Barr .  , HR.

*Theline ( Theline ) Avienus ( Ora maritima  - ) says that the city of Arelate (Arles), by the river Rhone, was formerly called  Theline, 'when  it  was  inhabited  by  Greeks' ( Arelatus  illic  ciuitas  attollitur, Theline  uocata  sub  priore saeculo, graio incolente ). Strabo  .  .  is silent about the Greek identity of Arelate but describes it as a π/omicronacuteλις κα/iotagrave /epsilonlenis µ π/omicronacuteριον ο/upsilonlenis µ /iotaacuteκρον . Archaeology suggests the existence of a Greek emporion from c.  , which lost its Greek character fromperhaps-C  f (Arcelin (  )). Barr .  , ACH.

Troizen ( Τροιζ/etaacuteν ) The last  of the  cities  called  Troizen and mentioned by Steph.Byz.  .  , it is in Italy, but belongs to Massalia ( /epsilonlenisν Μασσαλ/iotaacute/Omegasubiotaα τ/etatildeς ' Ιταλ/iotaacuteας ). In  addition, Eust. Il .  .  mentions a Massaliote city called Troizen and placed in Italy ( κα/iotagrave /epsilonasperτ/epsilonacuteρα /epsilonlenisν ' Ιταλ/iotaacute/Omegasubiotaα Μασσαλιωτικ/etaacute ). Some scholars suggest that this Troizen must be a fortress located in southern France, but situated east of the river Var and so, formally, beyond the frontier between the prouincia and Italia, but subject to Massalia, as was Nikaia (Strabo  .  .  ) and the other Massaliote poleis in Italy listed by Ptol. Geog .  .  .  (cf. Barruol (  )  ); others emend the text of Stephanos and suppose the existence of two cities  called Troizen, one in the territory of Massalia and another in Italy (cf. Brunel (  )) or suggest a mistake in Stephanos' and Ptolemaios' reading  of their  sources  (cf. Clerc  (  )  - ); finally, it  has  been  suggested  that  Massaliote Troizen in Italy cannot be other than the city of Poseidonia (cf. Morel (  )  - ), neighbouring on and supposedly closely related to Phokaian Hyele (no.  ), in its turn apparently  closely  related  to  Massalia  (Ps.-Skymnos  : κα/iotagrave Μασσαλιωτ/omegatildeν Φωκα/epsilonacuteων τ ' ' Ελ/epsilonacuteα π/omicronacuteλις ).

##  . The Mediterranean Coast of Spain

The Greeks referred to the coast of the Iberian peninsula by the generic name ' Ιβηρ/iotaacuteα , a term which, as time went on, ended up as the name of the whole peninsula (Strabo  .  .  ). The name Iberia seems to have been coined by the Greeks to designate the westernmost places in the Mediterranean visited by them since C  l; it presumably derives from the name of the river Hiberos; however, the name Hiberos was applied to several  rivers  of the  Iberian  peninsula  in  antiquity (Domínguez (  ); Jacob (  ); Gailledrat (  )  - ), and this fact may explain the different and sometimes contradictory views which ancient writers hold on the extent of Iberia (cf. Strabo  .  .  ). However, even if Herodotos (  .  ) still distinguishes between Tartessos and Iberia, the C  l historian Herodoros of Herakleia (( FGrHist  ) fr.  a) includes within Iberia all of the coast between the western end of the peninsula and the river Rhône, and so Strabo's definition of Iberia  may be valid from C  l  onwards: ο/iotaasper δ/epsilongrave ν/upsilontildeν /omicronasperacuteριον α/upsilonlenisτ/etatildeς τ/iotaacuteθενται τ/etagraveν Πυρ/etaacuteνην (  .  .  ).

If the  late  and  hardly  reliable  references  to  Rhodian colonisation in Iberia (see Rhode (no.  ) with Domínguez (  )  and  Santiago  (  b ))  are  disregarded, the  only Greeks to frequent Iberia seem to have been the Samians and, above all, the Phokaians (Hdt.  .  ,  .  .  ; Domínguez (  a ), (  )  - ). Archaeological evidence for  the  earliest  contacts, of C  l/C  e, is  found  at  e.g. the Tartessian  town  of Onoba  (modern  Huelva; Cabrera (  - )), at  the  Phoenician  city  at  Cerro  del  Villar (Cabrera (  )) and at the Iberian village at the location where  Emporion  was  eventually  founded  (Aquilué et  al . (  )  - ). However, these early contacts did not lead to the foundation of Greek poleis : only Emporion developed the structures of a polis and then only several decades after the initial contacts between Greeks and natives. The Greek settlements  in  Iberia  were  foundations  of the  Phokaians (no.  ) or, perhaps, of the Phokaians from Massalia (no.  ); at  least, it  seems  that  Massalia  ended  up  controlling, probably both economically and politically, a major part of the coastal regions of Iberia.

The  Greek  settlements  in  Iberia  mentioned  by  our sources are the following.

Alonis ( /Alphalenisλων/iotaacuteς ) Artemidoros  ( apud Steph. Byz.  .  ) describes Alonis as a ν/etatildeσος κα/iotagrave π/omicronacuteλις Μασσαλ/iotaacuteας . It is not completely  certain  that  Alonis  was  located  in  Iberia, although it may be the place called Allone by Pompon.  .  , and  situated  in  the Sinus  Ilicitanus ; it  could  also  be  the /Alphalenisλωνα/iotaacute of Ptol. Geog .  .  .  . It  remains unlocated,although many suggestions have been advanced for its site (García y Bellido (  )  - ); recently, Rouillard (  )  - has suggested that it may be on modern Santa Pola, where excavations have revealed a (native) fortified settlement of C  s and finds show strong Greek influences (Moret et al . (  ); Badié and Moret (  )). Barr .  (S. Pola?), CHRL.

Hemeroskopeion ( ' Η µ εροσκοπε/iotatildeον ) Hemeroskopeion was  the  most  famous  ( γνωρι µ /omegaacuteτατον )  of the  three πολ/iotaacuteχνια Μασσαλιωτ/omegatildeν between the river Jucar and New Carthage (Strabo  .  .  : µ εταξ/upsilongrave [. . .] το/upsilontilde Σο/upsilonacuteκρωνος κα/iotagrave
