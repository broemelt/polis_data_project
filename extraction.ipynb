      "However, the  foundation  of Massalia  marked  the  real beginning of Greek presence and expansion in the region, an  expansion  that  was  basically  a  coastal  phenomenon; besides, the expansion of Massalia was a long-term process running from C  to the beginnings of the Roman occupation  of the  region. Massaliote  activity, moreover, varied from period to period: during C  and C  e it was directed towards  the  development  of commercial  interests  (Bats (  )), whereas from C  l/C  e it aimed primarily at establishing greater territorial control through the foundation of colonies and fortified centres. Such settlements are, obviously, of greater interest to our sources and are described below. Whether any of the settlements founded by Massalia in this period, and presumably dependent on it, can be considered poleis (albeit dependent poleis ; cf. Hansen (  b )) is uncertain: some may have been poleis , but in no case does the  evidence  warrant  inclusion  in  the  Inventory, which includes only two possible Massaliote foundations: Emporion (no.  ) and Rhode (no.  ). Of these, Emporion certainly  and  Rhode  possibly  were  founded  prior  to  C  . According to ancient writers,Massalia's reason for founding these settlements was the need for defence against the barbarians living in the direction of Iberia as well as towards Liguria (Strabo  .  .  ); trade interests or the wish to control the coastline may have provided an additional reason (as implied by Strabo  .  .  ,  and  .  .  ).\n",

Archaeology has revealed two phases of occupation; in the earlier phase Agathe was probably only an empo- rion , and remains of C  -C  f houses of mudbrick seem to belong to it; to the later 'Massaliote' phase from C  l belong houses with stone basements and mudbrick walls.

The ancient city  of Antipolis  must  be  somewhere  below  modern Antibes; however, the  relatively  abundant  Archaic  finds (Clergues (  ); Ducat (  )  - ) must belong to the native village; the remains of the supposed Archaic Greek city  are, consequently, unlocated  so  far  (Bats  (  )).
