1,Alalie,Spain and France (including Corsica),42.1,9.7,656,3367,"1 . Alalie Map 48 b. Lat. 42 . 10 , long. 9 . 70 . Size of territory: 3 (?). Type: A: α . The toponym is Αλαλίη , η (Hdt. 1 . 165 . 1 , 166 . 3 ). A city-ethnic is not attested; Herodotos refers to the community as οι Φωκαιεῖς ( 1 . 166 . 2 bis ). Alalie is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 1 . 165 . 1 ( ανεστήσαντο πόλιν ). The name of the territory is unknown, but its extent, after C6m when the refugees from Phokaia arrived,has been calculated at 200 km ² (Gras ( 1985 ) 404 ), and it may have been divided into lots (Jehasse and Jehasse ( 1987 ) 380 ). The 'epoecised' city put a fleet of sixty ships to sea (Hdt. 1 . 166 . 2 ), which indicates a population of c. 20 , 000 inhabitants (Gras ( 1985 ) 400 -6 ) or even more (Domínguez ( 1985 ) 375 -76 ). Alalie was founded by Phokaia (no. 859 ), in accordance with an oracle, 20 years before the fall of Phokaia, i.e. c. 560 (Hdt. 1 . 165 . 1 ). In c. 546 the Phokaians decided to relocate their city in reaction to the Persian threat, and almost half of the Phokaians were received at Alalie. From the Alalian point of view, the arrival of these refugees may have been perceived as reception of epoikoi , while from the point of view of the Phokaians it was a case of metoikesis (Demand ( 1990 ) 37 ). The refugees arrived with wives, sons and sacred objects from their home sanctuaries (Hdt. 1 . 164 . 3 , 166 . 3 ). After a naval battle with the Carthaginians and the Etruscans c. 540 , in which the Alalians were victorious but suffered severe losses, the city was perhaps dismantled (Hdt. 1 . 166 . 3 : ανέλαβον [. . .] καιgrave τηgraveν άλλην κτίσιν ), and certainly abandoned (Hdt. 1 . 166 . 3 : ανέλαβον ταgrave τέκνα καιgrave ταgraveς γυναῖκας [. . .] καιgrave έπειτα απέντες τηgraveν Κυacuteρνον έπλεον ες ' Ρήγιον ). However, the abandonment was perhaps not complete, as the existence of some archaeological remains dated to C6l (and antedating the foundation(?) of the Etruscan city) would suggest (Jehasse and Jehasse ( 1982 ) 255 ; cf. Domínguez ( 1985 ) 376 -77 ). In any case, after the battle, Alalie ceased to be a polis and its site was subsequently occupied by an Etruscan city, whose cemetery (C6l-C3m) has been excavated (Jehasse and Jehasse ( 1973 )). Herodotos 1 . 166 . 3 seems to imply the existence of a political body making decisions, but its composition or organisation is unknown. At 1 . 166 . 1 he implies the existence of religious precints ( ιasperρά ) at Alalie, some of them perhaps of a substantial nature (temples?-he uses the verb ενιδρυacuteω ); besides, the Phokaian refugees carried with them all the sacred objects, statues and offerings ( ταgrave αγάλ µ ατα [. . .] καιgrave ταgrave άλλα αναθή µ ατα ) taken from their original hiera at Phokaia-except those made of bronze and stone and the paintings (Hdt. 1 . 164 . 3 )-and we may think that they placed these in newly built edifices as soon as they arrived at Alalie; however,they have not been identified. Remains of a city wall have been discovered, of the agger type, with a broad glacis in front of it, perhaps dated to C6s (Jehasse and Jehasse ( 1982 ) 250 -53 , ( 1994 ) 312 -14 ) and perhaps protecting the Greek city. There are also remains of C6s dwellings constructed in mudbrick (Jehasse and Jehasse ( 1994 ) 312 ) as well as Greek pottery of Archaic date (Jehasse and Jehasse ( 1982 ) 251 -54 )."
2,Emporion (Emporites),Spain and France (including Corsica),42.1,3.1,1752,8791,"2 . Emporion (Emporites) Map 25 . Lat. 42 . 10 , long. 3 . 10 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A: β . The toponym is ' Ε µ πόριον , τό (Ps.-Skylax 2 ; Ps.-Skymnos 204 ) and the city-ethnic is ' Ε µ πορίτης ( SEG 37 838 ( 530 -500 ); Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 ) or ' Ενπορείτης (C4l coins, infra ). Some scholars have suggested that the original name may have been Pyrene (Hind ( 1972 )) or *Kypsela (Lamboglia ( 1949 ), ( 1974 ); Oikonomides ( 1974 )) and one of these names (in particular Pyrene) might well have been the name of the first settlement, which was renamed Παλαιαgrave πόλις (Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 ) when the (new) city on the mainland was founded; however,there is no evidence for the use of any of these names to refer to Emporion, whose name is presumably attested already in C6l ( SEG 38 838 ; cf. supra ). Apart from Ps.-Skylax 2 (Hansen ( 1997 a ) 88 ), the earliest references to Emporion as a polis are in Polyb. 3 . 39 . 7 and Ps.-Skymnos 202 -4 (all in the urban sense). It is described as a polis in the urban and political sense by Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 , a passage which also refers to the politeuma and uses dipolis about Emporion. If Pyrene at Hdt. 2 . 33 . 2 designates the present city, this passage provides an occurrence of polis in the territorial sense. It is usually inferred from the toponym that Emporion was an emporion . For a discussion of this question, see Hansen (forthcoming). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a C6l inscription ( SEG 37 838 ) and on coins ( ΕΜ , ΕΜΠ , ΕΜΠΟΡ (C5l-C4 ); ΕΜΠΟΡΙΤΩΝ (C4l-C3 ); Villaronga ( 1994 ) 3 -8 , 1730 ) and externally in a commercial document of C5m ( SEG 38 1036 ). Emporion was founded c. 600 (Aquilué et al . ( 1996 ) 61 -62 ), whether by Massaliote Phokaians (Ps.-Skymnos 203 -4 ), Massaliotes (Ps.-Skylax 2 ; Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 ) or Phokaians (Livy 26 . 19 , 34 . 4 ; cf. Pliny 3 . 22 ). Ps.-Skymnos 204 -5 includes Emporion among the Greek poleis founded by Massalia ( καιgrave πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες , αasperacuteς Μασσαλιῶται Φωκαεῖς απΩsubiotaώκισαν · πρώτη µ εgraveν ' Ε µ πόριον ); Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 seems to imply that Emporion was included within the system of fortresses set up by Massalia to protect the coast ( supra 162 -63 ). However, on present evidence it is not clear how long Emporion remained within that Massaliote system (cf. Gschnitzer ( 1958 ) 25 -26 ). The territory of Emporion stretched into the interior of the country ( mesogaia ), and at least a part of it was called ' Ιουγκάριον πεδίον (Strabo 3 . 4 . 9 ). According to some scholars, the territory comprised 360 km ² and may have been bordered by native villages (Plana ( 1994 ) 109 -16 ). In one of these the remains of a possible C3sanctuary of Demeter have been found; it may have replaced an older shrine (Pons ( 1993 )). The existence of a C4 cadaster occupying 15 , 000 ha has also been proposed (Plana ( 1994 ) 169 -89 ). However, these figures seem too high for such a tiny urban centre, and other scholars have suggested a smaller territory of c. 3 , 300 ha: 1 , 300 ha of arable land and 2 , 000 ha of eschatia (Sanmartí ( 1993 ) 92 -94 ). The reference in Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 to Rhode (no. 4 ) as a πολίχνιον ' Ε µ ποριτῶν seems to imply that, at least by C1s, Emporion had integrated the territory of Rhode into its own territory. On the basis of the size of the city ( 5 ha), it has been supposed that the inhabitants numbered max. 1 , 500 -2 , 000 (Domínguez ( 1986 ) 4 ; Marcet and Sanmartí ( 1990 ) 118 -19 ). Originally Emporion was divided into separate Greek and non-Greek communities, but at a certain point the two communities merged into one to form a single citizen body of mixed ethnicity (Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 ; Pena ( 1988 ) 11 -27 ; Santiago ( 1994 a )). This merger may have taken place c. 375 , when the second city wall was constructed, thus suppressing an extraurban settlement (assigned to the natives by its excavator), and situated by the C5 city wall (Sanmartí ( 1993 ) 88 -89 ). The existence of a political community is indicated by the C5 -C4mint ( infra ) and by bricks stamped ∆ΗΜ ( = δη µ οσία / δη µ όσιον ) and dated perhaps to C3 (Almagro ( 1952 ) no. 35 ; Pena ( 1992 ) 141 ). The only reference to the political system is found in Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 , which refers to a πολίτευ µ α µ ικτόν of Greek and barbarian νό µ ι µ α produced by the merger described supra . A C5s lead tablet found at Emporion contains the word (or the ending) νό µ ος , although its precise meaning cannot be determined (Almagro ( 1952 ) no. 21 ; Pena ( 1992 ) 140 -41 ; Santiago ( 1993 ) 288 -89 ). The honours owed to Artemis Ephesia were presumably defined by law (Strabo 4 . 1 . 4 ), and in later sources there are references to custom ( mos ) and laws ( leges ; Livy 34 . 9 (rC2e)). Livy ( 34 . 9 (rC3e)) also refers to several magistrates. The agora of the city is known only in its C2f form (Mar and Ruiz de Arbulo ( 1993 ) 160 -69 ). Although Artemis Ephesia was worshipped at Emporion (Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 ), her sanctuary has not yet been identified. A C5s sanctuary consisting of at least an Ionic temple and a double altar has been excavated in the southern part of the city.In C4f the area was reorganised and a new sanctuary constructed, perhaps devoted to Asklepios; the Palaia polis has yielded a relief depicting two sphinxes, almost certainly from a temple (Marcet and Sanmartí ( 1990 ) 69 ). The city had a public water reservoir, dug in C4e, and included within the sacred area placed in the southern part of the city, by the city walls and their southern entrance gate (ibid. ( 1990 ) 87 ). The earliest Greek settlement, in antiquity situated on an island that is now connected to the continent, may have functioned as the acropolis; it was called Παλαιαgrave πόλις (Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 ). Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 mentions the existence of a city wall at Emporion and sketches the history of its development. The first wall so far known was constructed in C5s in the southern part of the city (Sanmartí and Nolla ( 1986 )); c. 375 that wall was dismantled and in the same area a new wall was constructed with an elaborate L-shaped entrance system (Sanmartí et al . ( 1992 )); this is certainly the wall mentioned by Livy 34 . 9 . In C3s a proteichisma was constructed; however, in C2m all these fortifications were demolished and, reusing the same stones, a new wall was constructed 20 m further out, a wall that is still preserved (Sanmartí et al . ( 1988 )).According to Livy 34 . 9 (rC2e), the defence of the city walls of the polis was-at least in times of war-entrusted to one-third of the inhabitants, who were on duty every night. The oldest remains of dwellings come from the Palaia polis and consist of rectangular rooms in mudbrick on stone basements; they date to C6f (Aquilué et al . ( 1996 ) 57 -58 , ( 1999 ) 217 -30 ). The city on the mainland seems to have reached its maximum extent already in C5s, which makes it difficult to sketch the first stages of its development and layout; in any case, it seems to have been centred on a main street running north-south and crossed at right angles by secondary streets (Marcet and Sanmartí ( 1990 ) 106 -8 ). The patron divinity of Emporion was Artemis Ephesia (Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 ); cults of the Nymphs, Themis and Poseidon are epigraphically attested (Almagro ( 1952 ) nos. 9 -11 , 49 ), as are cults of Asklepios and Sarapis; in all these cases the evidence is Heltic or Roman. The mint of Emporion possibly began to strike silver coins of the Auriol type in C5f, imitating Massaliote prototypes. From C5m the mint produced minor denominations and was under the influence of Sicily, Mainland Greece and Asia Minor; their weights vary from 0 . 15 / 0 . 25 g to 0 . 40 / 0 . 45 g and 0 . 90 / 0 . 95 g; the coins are anepigraphic. C5l/C4f coins are inscribed with the legend ΕΜ , ΕΜΠ or ΕΜΠΟΡ and show influences from Magna Graecia and Athens; the weight is 0 . 94 g. From C4l Emporion struck a so-called drachm weighing 4 . 70 g. Types: obv . head of a goddess (Artemis?); legend: ΕΜΠΟΡΙΤΩΝ or ΕΝΠΟΡΕΙΤΩΝ ; rev . horse (Villaronga ( 1997 )). It is quite possible that all these coins were struck on the Phokaian standard (Campo ( 1992 ); García-Bellido ( 1994 )), and both the first issues and the drachms seem also to be related to the weights of the Massaliote system (Villaronga ( 1998 ); Head, HN ² 1 -2 ; SNG Cop. Spain-Gaul 637 -39 ). Emporion was perhaps considered to be the coloniser of nearby Rhode (no. 4 ; Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 ). A very fragmentary C5s lead tablet has the sequence [. . . ό ] κο εσκατοικίσαι , meaning something like 'where to establish (or found) a city' (Almagro ( 1952 ) no. 21 ; Pena ( 1992 ) 140 -41 ; Santiago ( 1993 ) 288 -89 ), though it is unclear where and when the eventual foundation was to be planted."
3,Massalia (Massaliotes),Spain and France (including Corsica),43.28,5.22,2591,12988,"3 . Massalia (Massaliotes) Map 15 . Lat. 43 . 28 , long. 5 . 22 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Μασσαλία , ηasper (Hecat. fr. 55 ; Thuc. 1 . 13 . 6 ) and the city-ethnic Μασσαλιώτης (Dem. 32 . 8 ; Arist. fr. 560 ). In the Ionic dialect they are, respectively, Μασσαλίη (Hdt. 5 . 9 . 15 ) and Μασσαλιήτες ( LSAG 288 no. 2 (C5f)). Massalia is called a polis Hel in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 4 (cf. Ps.-Skymnos 209 , perhaps drawing on Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 71 , though probably not for the term polis ). It is called polis in the political sense by Arist. Pol . 1305 b 4 -5 ; politikos is used about the constitution at Arist. Pol . 1305 b 10 , and politeuma is found at Pol . 1321 a 30 -31 ; there was an Aristotelian Massalioton politeia (Arist. fr. 560 ), and Dem. 32 . 8 refers to the politai . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C5m coins (Brenot ( 1992 )) and externally in Dem. 32 . 8 -9 and Arist. fr. 560 . The earliest examples of the external individual use are LSAG 288 no. 2 (C5f) and IG xiv295 (C4f); see further Robert ( 1968 ) and Manganaro ( 1992 )). There are two different traditions about the foundation of Massalia, and consequently two different dates for the foundation. One tradition places the foundation in 600 (Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 7 = 120 years before the battle of Salamis), while the other places it at the time of the fall of Phokaia (no. 859 ) to the Persians in 546 (Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 8 ; Isoc. Archidamus 84 ). The archaeological evidence supports the earlier date (Graham ( 2001 ) 38 ), but the existence of two different foundation dates may perhaps suggest a kind of refoundation in C6m, as a consequence of the arrival of refugees from Phokaia after the Persian conquest of Ionia (Gras ( 1987 ); Domínguez ( 1991 b ) 250 -53 ; Bats ( 1994 ); Gras ( 1995 )). All the sources agree on the metropolis : Phokaia (Hecat. fr. 55 ; Thuc. 1 . 13 -14 ; Arist. fr. 560 ), though there is no unanimity concerning the oecist(s): it was Euxenos (Arist. fr. 560 ), or Simos and Protis (Just. Epit . 43 . 3 . 8 -11 ), or Protis (Plut. Sol . 2 . 7 ) the son of Euxenos (Arist.); or Kreontiades (Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 8 ); finally, Strabo 4 . 1 . 4 stresses the role of the Ephesian woman Aristarche as ηasperγέ µ ων τουtilde πλουtilde , whatever that means (Malkin ( 1990 ) 51 -52 ). Similarly, there are different foundation myths for the city in Classical sources: marriage of the Greek oecist to the daughter of the native king (Arist. fr. 560 and Just. Epit . 43 . 3 . 4 -12 , with some variations); a completely different tradition,including the flight from Phokaia during the Persian conquest, is found in Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 8 and Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 72 . Strabo 4 . 1 . 4 gives details which may correspond to any of these traditions. Despite the marriage between the Greek oecist and the native king's daughter, which led to the foundation of the city according to Arist. fr. 560 , Massalia was always considered a Hellenic and not a mixed polis (cf. Ps.-Skylax 4 ; Livy 37 . 54 . 22 (r 189 )). The territory is called Μασσαλιώτις (Strabo 4 . 2 . 3 ); the toponym may also have been used to denote the territory (cf. Brunel ( 1945 )); it is referred to as ηasper Μασσαλιωτῶν χώρα at Arist. Mir. ausc . 837 b 8 (cf. Ps.-Skylax 4 ) and is described as planted with olives and vines but poor in grain (Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 ). The territory of Massalia has been the subject of much discussion (Bats ( 1986 ) 17 -19 ; Morel ( 1986 )) and it is now supposed that throughout the Archaic and Classical periods Massalia possessed a territory of c. 70 km ² (Arcelin ( 1986 ) 74 ), territorial expansion taking off only in C3 (Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 ; Bats ( 1986 ); Arcelin ( 1986 ) 52 -75 ). In any case, there are hardly any archaeological traces of the occupation of the territory (Arcelin ( 1986 ) 47 ). Apart from controlling its territory proper, Massalia seems to have founded, and kept under its sway, a network of coastal cities (Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 , 9 ) with the intention of protecting the coast against incursions of inland barbarians. Leaving aside the very problematic cases of the cities in Iberia (Emporion, Rhode, etc.), the beginning of this policy can be dated to C5l, which saw the foundation of Agathe, and its continuation is marked by the foundations of Olbia (C4s), Tauroeis (C3l) and Nikaia (C3l/C2e?), the only cities for which we have acceptable dates (Bats ( 1986 ) 27 -30 ). The way in which Massalia controlled these foundations is incompletely known (Gschnitzer ( 1958 ) 20 -26 ), although in general it seems that the majority (or all) of them may have been dependent ' poleis founded as fortresses' in the typology of Hansen ( 1997 b ) 36 no. 12 ; however, in no case can polis status be proved, and accordingly each city is briefly described in the Introduction above. If we can trust Justinus' retrospective narrative, Massalia had a foedus and amicitia with Rome from the time of its foundation (Just. Epit . 43 . 3 . 4 , 5 . 3 ), completed in C4e with the granting to Massalia of immunitas and the establishment (or renewal?) of a foedus aequo iure (Just. Epit . 43 . 5 . 10 ; see Nenci ( 1958 ) 63 -97 ). Massalia sent envoys to Delphi in C4e (Just. Epit . 43 . 5 . 8 ). The armed forces of Massalia, especially the fleet, were deployed on several occasions; thus, a naval defeat of the Carthaginians is reported for the very moment of the foundation (Thuc. 1 . 13 . 6 ; Paus. 10 . 18 . 7 ) as well as for later occasions (Just. Epit . 43 . 5 . 2 ; Gras ( 1987 )). On land Massalia waged wars against the natives from the foundation of the city (Just. Epit . 43 . 4 . 9 -11 , 5 . 1 ) and established a network of fortified places for protection against the native populations (Just. Epit . 43 . 3 . 13 ; Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 , 9 (C4 ?)); cf. supra . It has been suggested that the total population of the city never exceeded 20 , 000 inhabitants (Bats ( 1992 ) 273 ). The existence of γένη , such as the Πρωτιάδαι , is attested for C4 (Arist. fr. 560 ). Massalia had an oligarchic constitution (Arist. Pol . 1305 b 4 , 10 , 1320 b 18 , 1321 a 30 ); the enfranchised citizens are referred to as the politeuma , and access to the politeuma was by election of those found worthy of membership (Arist. Pol . 1321 a 29 -31 ). Aristotle also refers to an undated stasis in Massalia by which the oligarchy was changed into a constitution that came closer to being a politeia , the positive variant of popular rule ( Pol . 1305 b 1 -4 ); perhaps its outcome is the eunomic aristocracy mentioned by Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 for his own day (or that of his informant(s)). Some Massiliote laws are referred to by Theophr. fr. 117 , Wimmer; Ael. VH 2 . 38 . 1 ; and Livy 37 . 54 . 22 (r 189 ). These laws were Ionic ( νό µ οι ' Ιωνικοί ) and were exhibited in public (Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 ). Val. Max. 2 . 6 . 7 mentions the death penalty as having been used since the foundation of the city. Massalia had a council (interpreted as a senatus by Val. Max. 2 . 6 . 7 ) called the Six Hundred ( οιasper /asperΕξακόσιοι ), whose members served for life and were called τι µ ουacuteχοι ( I.Lampsakos 4 . 45 , 48 (C2e); Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 ); this council was presided over by the Fifteen ( οιasper Πεντεκαίδεκα ; Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 ; Caesar, BCiv . 1 . 35 . 1 ), who were in turn controlled by the Three ( οιasper Τρεῖς ; Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 ), one of whom was chairman (Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 ) and possibly the eponymous magistrate, although this is not confirmed. There is no solid evidence for the existence of an assembly at Massalia; however, the existence of a demos may possibly be implied by the reference to the public exhibition ( δη µ οσίΩsubiotaα ) of the laws (Strabo 4 . 1 . 5 ), and IG xiv 357 (C1 ?) has sometimes been interpreted to prove the existence of a demos , but it is a problematic document: Properzio ( 1989 ) 296 -97 denies that it alludes to a Massaliote demos , while Clerc ( 1927 ) 451 n. 1 considers the inscription a falsum. In C2 , and almost certainly before, the agora of Massalia was situated in a low-lying area between the two main elevations of the city, Saint-Laurent hill and Moulins hill (Gantès ( 1992 ) 85 ). Although it has not been found, Massalia presumably had a temple dedicated to Athena, since Strabo 13 . 1 . 41 refers to its ξόανον just as Just. Epit . 43 . 5 . 6 (rC5 ?) alludes to its simulacrum and to the porticus of the temple, situated on the arx . The city also possessed a ιasperερόν devoted to Apollo Delphinios and a temple ( νεώς ) dedicated to Artemis Ephesia, both on the άκρα (Strabo 4 . 1 . 4 ). A monumental Ionic C6l capital has been unearthed (Benoit ( 1954 )), as has a set of fifty tiny C5e naiskoi with a seated goddess pertaining to two different sanctuaries (Clerc ( 1927 ) 227 -40 ); a possible C4e Thesmophorion has also been identified (Gantès ( 1992 ) 79 , 85 ). The water management system of the city was very elaborate, with cisterns, water reservoirs and drains, some of them dating to C6e (Trouset ( 1990 )). There is an epigraphical reference to a stadion (perhaps of Roman date: Benoit ( 1966 ) 20 ); from the foundation of the city the harbour received special attention and many substantial structures related to it have been excavated, the oldest ones dating to C6l (Guéry ( 1992 ); Hesnard ( 1995 ) 65 -78 ). Massalia had an acropolis; Strabo 4 . 1 . 4 refers to the πέτρα , presumably the acropolis, and furthermore refers to the άκρα , presumably a part within the acropolis. The acropolis was perhaps encircled by a separate wall, different from that around the city proper according to Strabo himself ( 4 . 1 . 4 ; Tréziny ( 1994 ) 128 -29 , modified in Tréziny ( 2001 ) 49 ). Just. Epit . 43 . 4 implies the existence of walls from at least the second generation of colonists. There are remains of an early (C6l) city wall which already enclosed the area of the later city almost in its entirety; in C4 a new defensive system was built and the previous wall razed to the ground at several points (Tréziny ( 1994 ) 125 -30 , ( 1995 ) 44 -45 , ( 2001 ) 45 -53 ). During C6f Massalia slowly expanded and came to occupy almost 25 ha; in C6m the extent of the city was already more or less similar to that of the later city ( c. 40 ha (Tréziny ( 2001 ) 53 ). While some houses and other urban features are known from C6e, the general layout of the city is not fully known, though there is some evidence of C6m grid planning (Tréziny ( 1995 ) 50 ); perhaps the main axis of the city was constituted by the prolongation, inside the city, of the road that entered the city through the eastern gate and led to the agora.In C4f some quarters of the city had a regular plan (Gantès ( 1992 ); Moliner ( 2001 ) 101 -8 ). Strabo 4 . 1 . 4 seems to imply that the patron divinity was Artemis Ephesia. Also attested is the cult of Athena (Strabo 13 . 1 . 41 ), supposed by some scholars to be the protective divinity of the city (Tréziny ( 1994 ) 129 -30 ). Massalia celebrated the Anthesteria (referred to by Just. Epit . 43 . 4 . 6 (rC6 ) as Floralia ) and the Thargelia (Serv. ad Aen . 3 . 57 ; Lact. Plac. comm . ad Stat. Theb. 10 . 798 ; IG xiv 2464 (?); Salviat ( 1992 ) 144 -45 ). Massalia erected a treasury at Delphi (Diod. 14 . 93 . 4 (r 396 ), App. Ital . 8 . 3 (r 396 ; rC4m)), identified with the so-called Aiolian treasure at Marmaria and dated between 540 and 530 (Salviat ( 1981 )). Paus. 10 . 8 . 6 -7 furthermore mentions a statue of Athena dedicated at Delphi as well as one of Apollo ( 10 . 18 . 7 ) dedicated to commemorate a naval victory over the Carthaginians; Just. Epit . 43 . 5 . 8 (rC4e) also refers to the dedication of offerings to Apollo at Delphi. The mint of Massalia struck silver coins from c. 525 / 520 to 470 / 460 of the so-called Auriol-type, heavily influenced by contemporary Ionian issues (Furtwängler ( 1978 )). From C5m Massaliote coins became more similar to the coins issued in Magna Graecia and Sicily, and down to C4e we can trace at least seven issues of obols weighing from 0 . 71 to 0 . 85 g, with types mainly reminiscent of those found in Sicily. Many of these issues carry the legend ΜΑΣ , ΜΑΣΣ or even ΜΑΣΣΑΛΙΩΤΑΝ (in the Doric dialect; Brenot ( 1992 )). The minting of obols, although progressively of lower weight, continued until C3l (Brenot ( 1980 )). In C4e begins the minting of a new and short-lived coin, a drachm weighing 3 . 75 g (called a 'heavy drachm' to distinguish it from the 'light drachm' weighing 2 . 65 g issued from C3l). Issues of this coin ceased in 360 . It shows on the obv . Artemis Ephesia and on the rev . a lion similar to the lion on the coins of Elea; the legend is ΜΑΣΣΑΛΙΗΤΩΝ (this time in Ionic dialect; Brenot ( 1982 )). It has been argued that all these coins were struck on the Phokaian standard, despite the different weights used in the different issues (García-Bellido ( 1994 ); SNG Cop. Spain-Gaul 708 -28 )."
4,Rhode (Rhodetes),Spain and France (including Corsica),42.15,23.2,465,2231,"4 . Rhode (Rhodetes) Map 25 . Lat. 42 . 15 , long. 23 . 20 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: α . The toponym is ' Ρόδη (Ps.Skymnos 204 ; Steph. Byz. 546 . 4 ) or ' Ρόδος (Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 , 14 . 2 . 10 ); the city-ethnic is ' Ροδήτης (coins, infra ) or ' Ροδαῖος (Steph. Byz. 546 . 4 ). Rhode is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skymnos 202 -4 . Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 describes it as a polichnion . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested by C4l coin legends ( infra ). According to Strabo 14 . 2 . 10 , Rhode was colonised by Rhodians prior to the foundation of the Olympic Games. Ps.-Skymnos ( 205 -6 ; cf. Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 ) also alludes to a Rhodian foundation and to later Massaliote occupation (Ps.-Skymnos 203 ; cf. Strabo 14 . 2 . 10 ). Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 states that Rhode belonged to Emporion (no. 2 ). The sources thus seem to imply a double foundation, first by Rhodes and afterwards by Massalia (Strabo 14 . 2 . 10 ), or Phokaians from Massalia (Ps.-Skymnos 202 -6 ), or, alternatively, by Rhodians and Emporitans (Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 ). The much debated Rhodian foundation must, however, be rejected (Domínguez ( 1990 ); Santiago ( 1994 b ) 59 -63 ; Graham ( 2001 ) 36 -37 ). The short and obscure reference by Strabo 14 . 2 . 10 to the causes of the Rhodian foundation of Rhode ( επιgrave σωτηρίΩsubiotaα τῶν ανθρώπων ) may possibly be based on a foundation myth, but such a myth must be of a late date (Domínguez ( 1990 )). The only reference to public enactments is found in Strabo 4 . 1 . 4 , where he alludes to the enacting by law of the honours owed to Artemis Ephesia. This goddess had a temple in Rhode (Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 , 4 . 1 . 4 ) and was the patron divinity of the city (Strabo 3 . 4 . 8 ). Although the site of the Greek city has yielded ceramic evidence dating to C6l(?) and C5 (Martín, Nieto and Nolla ( 1979 ) 326 -27 ; Vivó ( 1996 ) 112 ), the earliest levels associated with habitation date from C4e (Puig et al . ( 1994 -95 ) 128 ). However, the layout of the settlement at this date is almost unknown,since in C3e the city underwent a complete reorganisation which obliterated the previous houses; it has, however, been suggested that the layout was more or less ## II.

5,Abakainon (Abakaininos),Sikelia,38.05,15.05,544,2644,"5 . Abakainon (Abakaininos) Map 47 . Lat. 38 . 05 , long. 15 . 05 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: β . The toponym is Αβακαίνη , ηasper (Diod. 14 . 90 . 3 ) or Αβάκαινον , τό (Diod. 19 . 65 . 6 ; Steph. Byz. 2 . 11 ). The city-ethnic is Αβακαινῖνος (C4s coins, infra ; Diod. 14 . 78 . 5 ; Steph. Byz. 2 . 15 ). Abakainon is called a polis in the urban and political senses at Diod. 14 . 90 . 3 (r 393 ) and 19 . 65 . 6 (r 315 ), and in the urban sense at 14 . 90 . 4 (r 393 ). The passage at 14 . 90 . 3 describes it as a polis symmachis of Magon,and in a later period it was part of the symmachia of Agathokles, alongside such poleis as Kamarina, Leontinoi, Katane and Messana (Diod. 19 . 65 . 6 (r 315 ), 19 . 110 . 4 (r 311 )). The internal collective use of the cityethnic is found on coins struck c. 400 ( infra ), and the external collective use is found in Diod. 19 . 110 . 4 (r 311 ). In 396 , Dionysios I deprived Abakainon of a part of its chora , which was handed over to his new foundation, Tyndaris (no. 49 ; Diod. 14 . 77 . 5 ). Abakainon was situated south-east of Tyndaris, at modern Tripi. The ancient city, destroyed by the modern, is poorly known. However, Diodorus' report ( 14 . 90 . 3 ) that in 393 Carthaginian troops defeated by Dionysios took refuge in the city ( έφυγον εις τηgraveν πόλιν ) suggests that by this date it was fortified. There are sporadic Greek remains from C6 , and substantial Greek remains from C4 (Villard ( 1954 )); the investigation of the extensive cemetery north of the city has brought to light also monumental C4 tombs of the type known from Leontinoi (Bacci and Spigo ( 1997 -98 )); the city minted a Greek-style coinage from C5m ( infra ). Abakainon struck silver coins (litra, hemilitron) from c. C5m: obv . laureate head, bearded (an indigenous god assimilated to Zeus) or beardless (assimilated to Apollo), or, on later coinage, female head (nymph, or Demeter or Persephone); rev . wild boar and acorn, at times a grain of barley or sow and piglet, legend: ΑΒΑ , ΑΒΑΚ (above acorn) ΙΝ (below), ΑΒΑΚ (on obv .) ΑΙΝΙ (on rev .), ΑΒΑΚΑΙΝΙΝΟΝ (Head, HN ² 118 ; Bertino ( 1975 ); SNG Cop. Sicily 1 -6 ). In C4s, the city struck in bronze: ( 1 ) Probably from the time of Timoleon: obv . female head; rev . forepart of bull, or forepart of man-headed bull, legend: ΑΒΑ , ΑΒΑΚ [ ΑΙΝΙ ] ΝΟΝ , ΑΒΑΚΑΙΝΙΝΩΝ (Head, HN ² 118 ; Bertino ( 1975 ) 124 -26 ; SNG Cop. Sicily 7 ); ( 2 ) c. 344 -338 : obv . head of Dioskouros, legend: ΑΒΑ ; rev . 'free horse' , legend: ΑΒΑ ; the obv . type may indicate influence from the mint of Tyndaris or,more generally,from southern Italy (Bertino ( 1975 ) 124 -26 )."
6,Adranon (Adranites),Sikelia,37.4,14.5,519,2561,"6 . Adranon (Adranites) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 40 , long. 14 . 50 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: α . The toponym is Αacuteδρανον , τό (Diod. 14 . 37 . 5 , 16 . 68 . 9 ; Steph. Byz. 28 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is Αδρανίτας (-ης ): C4s coins ( infra ) and Diod. 16 . 68 . 9 . Adranon was founded by Dionysios I c. 400 , and in his report of the foundation Diod. 14 . 37 . 5 refers to it as a polis ( πόλιν έκτισεν ), presumably in both the urban and the political senses; it is called polis in the urban sense at Diod. 16 . 68 . 9 (r 345 / 4 ); it is called a polis mikra in the urban sense at Plut. Tim . 12 . 2 and polichnion at 12 . 3 . The chronological relationship between Adranon and the neighbouring indigenous site of Mendolito (contemporary or successive sites?) is as yet unclarified (Albanese ( 1991 ) esp. 548 , 552 -53 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4s coins ( infra ), and the external collective use in Diod. 16 . 68 . 9 , 69 . 3 (r 345 / 4 ). A stasis is mentioned at Plut. Tim . 12 . 2 . In 344 / 3 , Timoleon received Adranon into his symmachia , and the city presumably provided him with armed forces (Diod. 16 . 69 . 3 ; Plut. Tim . 12 . 6 ). There are Greek finds from C6l at Adranon, but the majority of the finds from the habitation area and adjacent cemeteries belong to the Dionysian foundation and date from C4 -C3 ; the finds suggest a local production of redfigure pottery. The impressive ashlar isodomic double curtain-wall, enclosing an area of about 60 ha, probably dates from the period of Dionysios'foundation (its gates are mentioned at Plut. Tim . 12 . 6 ). Votive deposits found within the urban area have revealed a sanctuary of Demeter.Survey of site: Marotta D'Agata and Spigo ( 1984 ). Adranos, identified by the Greeks with Hephaistos and presumably the patron divinity of the city as well as a divinity honoured throughout Sicily, had a temple in the city (Plut. Tim . 12 . 2 , 6 ; LIMC1 : 229 -30 ). Adranon began minting bronze coins under Timoleon: ( 1 ) obv . Apollo,legend: ΑΠΟΛΛΩΝ ; rev . lyre; ( 2 ) obv . head of local river-god (Adranos?); rev . butting bull, legend: Α∆ΡΑΝΙΤΑΝ (Head, HN ² 118 -19 ; LIMC1 : 230 ; Karlsson ( 1995 ) 154 -55 with refs.; SNG Cop. Sicily 10 -12 ). A single known litra has obv . head of nymph; rev . bull, fish in exergue, and legends: ΠΙΑΚΙΝΟΣ and Α∆ΡΑΝ , a joint issue of Piakos (no. 43 ; possibly at Mendolito), and Adranon suggesting proximity and collaboration between these two communities (Jenkins ( 1975 ) 87 -92 ; see also the entry for Piakos)."
7,Agyrion (Agyrinaios),Sikelia,37.4,14.3,755,3716,"7 . Agyrion (Agyrinaios) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 40 , long. 14 . 30 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: α . The toponym is Αγυacuteριον , τό (Diod. 1 . 4 . 4 , 14 . 9 . 2 ), Αγουρίον (Ptol. Geog . 3 . 4 . 7 ), or Αγυacuteρινα (Steph. Byz. 23 . 19 ). The city-ethnic is Αγυριναῖος (Diod. 4 . 24 . 1 ). Diodorus calls his native city a polis in the political sense at 14 . 9 . 2 (r 404 ) and 14 . 95 . 4 (r 392 ); the urban sense is found in 14 . 95 . 5 (r 392 ); politai is found at 14 . 95 . 5 -6 . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C5l and C4 coins ( infra ), and Diodorus uses the collective city-ethnic e.g. at 14 . 65 . 5 . At 14 . 95 . 4 -7 (r 392 ), Diodorus describes Agyrion as ruled by the (Heled?) tyrant Agyris, allegedly the most powerful Sicilian ruler after Dionysios I; the city is described as walled ( τουtilde τείχους , 14 . 95 . 6 ), as having an acropolis ( 14 . 95 . 5 ) and c. 20 , 000 citizens ( πολίτας ουκ ελάττους δισ µ υρίων , 14 . 95 . 4 ), and Agyris as wealthy ( χρη µ άτων πολλῶν , 14 . 95 . 5 ). Agyris concluded a symmachia with Dionysios I and campaigned with him pandemei ( 14 . 95 . 7 ). In the time of Timoleon, Agyrion was ruled by the tyrant Apolloniades, who was, however, deposed by Timoleon, whereupon the Agyrians were granted Syracusan citizenship (Diod. 16 . 82 . 4 ; cf. Moggi ( 1976 ) 357 , who suggests that the population was transferred to Syracuse (no. 47 )). Timoleon later settled 10 , 000 new colonists in Agyrian territory ( ηasper Αγυριναία ), said to be sizeable (Diod. 16 . 82 . 5 ; the territory ( chora ) is mentioned also at Diod. 14 . 95 . 2 , from which passage it appears that in C4e it extended as far as the river Chrysas). In view of Diod. 16 . 83 . 3 , this was presumably a regular refoundation of Agyrion. It is there reported that the prosperity brought about by Timoleon (cf. R.P.A.Patanè ( 1992 ) 77 ) led to the erection of a splendid theatre, temples, a bouleuterion , an agora, a circuit wall with towers, and monumental tombs (Diod. 16 . 83 . 3 ); however, as Lewis ( 1994 ) 121 points out, Diodorus puts a suspicious amount of emphasis on his native city. But the appearance of the town in this report is clearly that of a Greek polis (cf. Hansen and Fischer-Hansen ( 1994 ) 85 ). Actual urban remains are scanty, and the archaeological evidence for cult sites is tenuous, consisting merely of a few architectural terracottas (Bejor ( 1984 a ) 63 ). The size and location of the theatre is, somewhat hypothetically, reconstructed on the basis of mediaeval documents (R. P. A. Patanè ( 1992 ) 77 -80 ). The circuit wall, no longer extant but depicted on an eighteenthcentury ad drawing,is dated to C4s on the basis of this evidence (ibid. 80 -82 ). A bronze coinage of Agyrion, revealing Akragantine influence, is known from possibly as early as C5m (cf. Bejor ( 1984 a ) 62 ), but at least from C5l, the period of the tyrant Agyris: obv . eagle with closed wings of Akragantine type; rev . wheel, legend: ΑΓΥΡΙΝΑ , ΑΓΥΡΙΝΑΙ , ΑΓΥΡΙΝΑΙΟΝ , ΑΓΥΡΙΝΑΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 124 ; SNG Cop. Sicily 126 ). C4s: obv . types: Herakles or Apollo or male head or river-gods; rev . leopard and hare or man-headed bull, legend: ΠΑΛΑΓΚΑΙΟΣ ; horse, or female figure sacrificing or warrior, with legend on some issues: ΑΓΥΡΙΝ , ΑΓΥΡΙΝΑΙ or ΑΓΥΡΙΝΑΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 125 ; R. P . A. Patanè ( 1992 ) 69 : from the period of Timoleon's refoundation; SNG Cop. Sicily 127 -29 ). During Timoleon's rule Agyrion issued a series of symmachia coins: obv . head of Zeus or Athena or river-god, legend: ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΙΟΣ rev . fulmen and eagle or club or free horse, legend: ΑΓΥΡΙΝΑΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 125 ; Cutroni Tusa ( 1980 -81 ) 491 ; Karlsson ( 1995 ) 157 , 163 )."
8,Aitna (Aitnaios),Sikelia,,,1914,9595,"8 . Aitna (Aitnaios) Map 47 . Location of Aitna I as Katane, but Aitna I with a larger territory (Diod. 11 . 49 . 1 ), the location and territorial size of Aitna II being unknown. Type: A: α (I), A?: α -β (II). The toponym is Αίτνα , ηasper (Pind. Pyth . 1 . 60 ; fr. 105 a, Maehler); or Αίτνη (Diod. 11 . 49 . 1 ; Strabo 6 . 2 . 3 ), though for example Diod. 11 . 66 . 4 and 67 . 7 (r 466 ) calls it Κατάνη . The city-ethnic is Αιτναῖος (C5f coins, infra ; Pind. Nem . 9 . 30 ). Aitna I Aitna (I) is called a polis by Pind. Pyth 1 . 31 and 61 , presumably in the urban as well as the political sense (cf. Hansen ( 2000 ) 175 -76 ; cf. Diod. 11 . 66 . 4 (r 466 )). ∆αtilde µ ος is found in Pind. Pyth . 1 . 70 . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on coins ( infra ); the external collective use is found in Pind. Nem . 9 . 30 . For the individual use of the city-ethnic, see below on the athletic record of Hieron and Chromios. In 476 , Hieron transferred the populations of Katane (no. 30 ) and Naxos (no. 41 ) to Leontinoi (no. 33 ), renamed Katane as Aitna , and settled his new foundation with 10 , 000 oiketores : 5 , 000 from the Peloponnese and 5 , 000 from Syracuse (no. 47 ; Diod. 11 . 49 . 2 ; cf. Schaefer ( 1961 ) 293 ); though the report on the relocation of populations refers to both Katane and Naxos, Katane (with parts of adjacent territories) was the site refounded as Aitna: καιgrave τηgraveν µ εgraveν Κατάνην µ ετωνό µ ασε Αίτνην , τηgraveν δεgrave χώραν ου µ όνον τηgraveν Καταναίαν αλλαgrave καιgrave πολληgraveν τηtildeς οasper µ όρου προσθειgraveς κατεκληρουacuteχησε , µ υρίους πληρώσας οικήτορας . (Cf. Strabo 6 . 2 . 3 , who focuses exclusively on Katane in his report on the foundation of Aitna.) Deinomenes, Hieron's son, ruled the city as βασιλευacuteς (Pind. Pyth . 1 . 60 -61 ). Chromios was installed by Hieron as τηtildeς Αίτνης επίτροπος and so presumably was the guardian of Deinomenes while he was still a minor (Schol. Pind. Nem . 9 ; cf. RE iii . 2454 ; Puech ( 1958 ) 19 ). Pind. Pyth . 1 . 62 says that Hieron founded the city ' Υλλίδος στάθ µ ας εν νό µ οις , presumably indicating that Aitna was intended as a Dorian city. After Hieron's death in 466 , his brother Thrasyboulos enlisted the help of the Aitnaians in his unsuccessful attempt to suppress the uprising of the Syracusans against him (Diod. 11 . 67 . 7 ); at Aitna the rule of Deinomenes survived long enough for him to erect a commemorative monument for Hieron by Onatas at Olympia (Paus. 6 . 12 . 1 -2 , 8 . 42 . 8 -10 ), but by 461 Hieron's settlers were expelled after long fighting ( πλείοσι µ άχαις ) with Syracuse as well as with the Sikels under Douketios (Diod. 11 . 76 . 3 ); the original Katanaians returned (Strabo 6 . 2 . 3 ) and a new geopolitical arrangement followed (Diod. 11 . 76 . 3 : κατεκληρουacuteχησαν τηgraveν γηtildeν , i.e. the Sikels and the Syracusans). The Aitnaians retired to Inessa and founded a new Aitna (Strabo 6 . 2 . 3 ), on which see below, Aitna II . With Diod. 11 . 49 . 2 , scholars see Hieron's foundation as a 'plan . . . thoroughly dominated by concern for mercenaries' (Demand ( 1990 ) 51 ), and Thrasyboulos indeed used Aitnaian forces in his power struggle at Syracuse ( supra ). In addition, Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 142 a = schol. Pind. Nem . 1 . 1 and Diod. 11 . 49 . 2 stress another, personal, motive of Hieron's: his wish to become an οικιστής with heroic honours (cf. Trumpf ( 1958 ) 131 and Harrell ( 2002 ) 444 -47 ). Hieron did in fact receive heroic honours at Aitna (I) in his capacity as oecist (Diod. 11 . 66 . 4 ); according to Strabo, he was buried at Aitna (I), but his tomb was destroyed by the Katanaians on their return ( 6 . 2 . 3 ). The phase of Aitna (I) is not archaeologically distinguishable from that of Katane (no. 30 ); however, the construction of the theatre ( TGR ii . 428 -30 , C5 ?) may perhaps be attributed to Hieron in the light of the tradition that Aischylos composed and performed The Women of Aitna in honour of the newly founded city (Aesch. fr. 25 , Mette). C5 votives attest to a sanctuary of Demeter, highly suggestive given the importance of this cult for the Deinomenids (Dunbabin ( 1984 ) 64 ; White ( 1964 )). The cult of Zeus became important at Aitna during the reign of Hieron (cf. Pind. Pyth 1 . 29 ; Ol . 6 . 96 ), an importance reflected in the type of a seated Zeus (Aitnaios) found on the coins of the new foundation. Hieron won victories at Olympia and at Delphi (refs. in Olympionikai 221 ) and was proclaimed a citizen of Aitna ( Αιτναῖος ) according to schol. Pind. Nem . 1 . 1 = Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 142 a, a custom followed by Chromios as well (ibid.). Chromios was victorious at the Nemean chariot race (Pind. Nem . 1 , date uncertain) and in the same event at Sikyon (no. 228 ; Pind. Nem . 9 , in 476 or 474 ). Aitna soon struck coins: a single surviving tetradrachm, probably from the time of its foundation ( 476 ), has on the obv . quadriga with Athena as charioteer and a Nike above,as at Syracuse; rev . Zeus enthroned, holding thunderbolt and an eagle-tipped sceptre. A single surviving drachm has obv . horseman; rev . type similar to the tetradrachm. The rev . of both denominations carries the legend ΑΙΤΝΑΙΟΝ (Boehringer ( 1968 ) 76 -79 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) 212 ). A magnificent tetradrachm with obv . head of a Silenos, legend: ΑΙΤΝΑΙΟΝ ; rev . seated Zeus, was issued either by the Aitnaians a few years before 461 or by them as an inauguration issue when they refounded Aitna (II). This second issue also has litrai with rev . thunderbolt, legend: ΑΙΤΝΑ ( ΙΟΝ ) (Boehringer ( 1968 ) 80 -98 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) 212 -13 ; Manganaro ( 1996 b ) 308 ). Aitna II The Aitnaians were expelled from Aitna (I) in 461 , retired to Inessa, a Sikel site 80 stades inland from Katane on Mt. Etna, and refounded their community there, proclaiming Hieron oikistes and preserving the name of Aitna (Strabo 6 . 2 . 3 ; Diod. 11 . 76 . 3 ). The location of Aitna II is unknown, although various attempts have been made to identify the site (Bombaci and Massa ( 1990 ) 290 -93 ). At its foundation this new community was presumably a polis , as indicated by the proclamation of an oecist (Strabo 6 . 2 . 3 ; cf. also infra on coins), but its later history was tumultuous: in 451 , Douketios took the city and in this connection Diod. 11 . 91 . 1 mentions a person whom he describes as οasper ηasperγουacute µ ενος αυτηtildeς ( sc . Αίτνης ). Syracusan hippeis in conflict with Dionysios I took Aitna in 405 (Diod. 13 . 113 . 3 ), and the site formed the base of opposition to Dionysios ( 14 . 7 . 7 , 8 . 1 , 9 . 5 ); Dionysios sent presbeis urging the exiles who had gathered with the hippeis at Aitna to return to Syracuse, but the majority remained at Aitna (Diod. 14 . 9 . 6 -8 ). In 403 the settlement (termed phrourion in this connection) was taken by Dionysios (Diod. 14 . 14 . 2 ). In 396 Dionysios I persuaded the 'Campanians living at Katane' to relocate to Aitna, and here it is again described as a phrourion (Diod. 14 . 58 . 2 ), which is not incompatible with its being a polis (cf. Thuc. 8 . 62 . 3 ; Nielsen ( 2002 )), but Dionysios obviously treated it as a dependency. Close connections with Syracuse may have been facilitated by the foundation history of Aitna. On the other hand, Syracusan control over the area of Aitna (II) may have a history going back beyond the original foundation: according to Diod. 11 . 26 . 7 , Gelon planned to build a temple of Demeter at Aitna, but because of his death it was never completed (Diod. 11 . 26 . 7 ). However, the date (the reign of Gelon) reveals that the 'Aitna' in question must have been Inessa ( = the later Aitna II) and not Aitna I founded by Hieron only in 476 , and so the passage reveals that Gelon held a dominion in the territory of Katane/Aitna II (cf. Freeman ( 1891 -94 ) ii. 524 -25 ). If Aitna can be presumed to have remained a polis during all these events, its identity as a Hellenic polis may be uncertain after the settlement of Campanians at the site: in 396 Himilkon sent ambassadors to 'the Campanians in possession of Aitna' , urging the city to cut its ties with Dionysios (Diod. 14 . 61 . 4 ), and Diod. 16 . 67 . 4 (r 345 ) again refers to 'the Campanians living at Aitna'; however, in 339 Timoleon 'destroyed the Campanians at Aitna, having forced them to surrender by siege'(Diod. 16 . 82 . 4 ), and Aitna appears in the C3s list of Delphic theorodokoi in Sicily ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) 25 , col. iv 96 ; Manganaro ( 1964 a ) 420 , 432 ), presumably as a fully Hellenic community. The polis status of C5 Aitna II is to some extent dependent upon the attribution to Aitna II of some litrai and, especially, of one C5m tetradrachm with obv . Silenos, legend: ΑΙΤΝΑΙΟΝ ; rev . seated Zeus, cf. Bombaci and Massa ( 1990 ) 289 ( supra ). The stylistic affinity between this issue and issues of Naxos (no. 41 ) and Katane (no. 30 ) has been seen by some, though perhaps not entirely convincingly, as evidence of a C5m sympoliteia between these cities in the face of Syracusan pressure (Bombaci and Massa ( 1990 ) 289 ). The Campanian mercenaries settled at Aitna II struck Timoleontic symmachia bronze coins in 342 -339 : ( 1 ) obv . head of Zeus Eleutherios, legend: ΖΕΥΣ ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΙΟΣ ; rev . thunderbolt, legend: ΑΙΤΝΑΙΟΝ (Bombaci and Massa ( 1990 ) 289 ; Karlsson ( 1995 ) 157 ; cf. Talbert ( 1974 ) 181 , 187 -88 ); ( 2 ) obv . head of Athena or Persephone, legend: ΑΙΤΝΑ [ ΩΝ ]; rev . 'free horse' (Bombaci and Massa ( 1990 ) 289 ; SNG Cop. Sicily 13 ; SNG Cop. Suppl . 60 )."

Ol . 2 . 93 and Pyth . 12 . 1 ) and by Ps.-Skylax 13 (where it is listed under the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε ); in the political sense polis occurs in Thuc. 6 . 4 . 4 , 7 . 46 . 1 . The politeia was described by Aristotle (Arist. fr. 479 ); Empedokles has patris (fr. 157 . 2 , DK) and άστυ (fr. 112 . 1 , DK). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C5s coins ( infra ), the internal individual use in Empedokles fr. 157 . 1 , DK.The external collective use is found at Hdt. 7 . 165 and in IGDS nos. 95 and 182 (C5 ); the external individual use is found in Hesperia 43 ( 1974 ) 322 , no. 3 . 6 ( 331 -324 ) and presumably in IGDS no. 182 b (C5 ); it is applied also to Empedokles (e.g.Arist. Cael. 279 b 16 ). Akragas was founded by Gela (Thuc. 6 . 4 . 4 ), according to other sources with the participation of a Rhodian contingent (Pind. fr. 105 , Bowra; Polyb. 9 . 27 . 8 ), 108 years after the foundation of Gela, i.e. c. 580 (Thuc. 6 . 4 . 4 ), 100 years before the Olympic victory of Theron at the 76 th Olympiad ( 476 ) according to Pindar ( Ol . 2 . 166 -69 with schol.). The oecists were Aristonoos and Pystilos (Thuc. 6 . 4 . 4 ). Of the two oecists mentioned in the sources, one may have come from Gela, the other from Gela's metropolis , Rhodos (cf. Leschhorn ( 1984 ) 52 -53 ; Musti ( 1992 )). The archaeological evidence, above all that from the Montelusa cemetery, is in agreement with the time of foundation given by the literary sources (Waele ( 1971 ) 88 -97 ; De Miro ( 1988 b ) 240 -44 ). The institutions of Akragas were modelled on those of Gela (Thuc. 6 . 4 . 4 : νό µ ι µ α ταgrave ΓελΩsubiotaώων ). The foundation of Akragas secured Geloan interests westwards. It is therefore not easy to map Akragantine and Geloan spheres of influence since sites such as Vassallaggi and Sabucina may have had first a Geloan, later an Akragantine phase. However, territorial ambitions under Phalaris secured territory westwards to the river Halykos and Selinountine territory with the site of Minoa, a city founded by Selinous (Hdt. 5 . 46 . 2 ); a palladion taken as spoils from the city of Minoa was dedicated to Athena Lindia by the Akragantines (Lind. Chron. ( FGrHist 532 ) fr. 30 = Xenagoras ( FGrHist 240 ) fr. 17 ). A number of phrouria laid out by Phalaris in Akragantine territory in the Himera valley are listed by Diod. 19 . 108 . 1 -2 ((rC6 ); cf. Polyaen. 5 . 1 . 3 ), but the tradition that Phalaris had a phrourion on the Eknomos hill may be a late fabrication; the site is normally located somewhere in the hills above Licata (Bejor ( 1989 d)). Spoils captured from Kokalos dedicated to Athena Lindia are listed in the Lindian Chronicle (( FGrHist 532 ) fr. 27 = Xenagoras ( FGrHist 240 ) fr. 14 ; survey of sources: Braccesi and De Miro ( 1992 ) 8 -12 ). Kamikos, the seat of Kokalos, was somewhere in the Akragantine hinterland (cf. Hdt. 7 . 170 . 1 , who calls it a polis inhabited in his day by Akragantines: πόλιν Κα µ ικόν , τηgraveν κατ ' ε µ εgrave Ακραγαντῖνοι ενέ µ οντο ; Diod. 4 . 78 . 2 ; De Miro ( 1962 )). Under Theron,Himera came within the Akragantine sphere of influence, and the domination of Akragas in the decade 483 -472 is reflected in the crab appearing on the rev . of the coins of Himera (Hdt. 7 . 165 ; Bonacasa ( 1992 ); cf. the entry for Himera). The influence of Akragas over a vast area of central Sicily is inferred also from the circulation of C5s Akragantine bronze coins (Vassallo ( 1983 )). The settlement pattern in the chora of Akragas is little known, and only a few suburban sanctuaries are known, among them the sanctuary dedicated to chthonic divinities at Palma di Montechiaro on the coast 20 km south-east of Akragas (Castellana ( 1994 )). There is evidence of a number of C6 phrouria and C6 Heled settlements along the coast between Gela and Akragas (Bejor ( 1987 ); Castellana ( 1994 ) 302 -4 ). Plut. Dio 49 . 1 mentions a site in Akragantine territory called Νέα πόλις which is, however, unlocated. Diod. 13 . 81 . 3 (r 406 ) refers to κτήσεις in the territory when it was evacuated in the face of the Carthaginian threat. According to Diog. Laert. 8 . 63 , Akragas had a population of 800 , 000 inhabitants at the time of Empedokles, an obvious exaggeration (Waele ( 1979 )). According to Diod. 11 . 53 . 5 , 4 , 000 Akragantines and Himeraians were killed in battle against Hieron in 472 , but the number of Akragantines is not specified. At 12 . 8 . 4 Diodorus relates that a thousand Akragantines were killed at the battle of Himera in 446 . At the time of the Carthaginian conflicts,Akragas had, accord- ing to Diod. 13 . 84 . 4 , 90 . 3 , a population of more than 20 , 000 citizens and with resident foreigners not less than 200 , 000 inhabitants (cf. Waele ( 1979 )). The constitutional history of the city was eventful.Within ten years of its foundation, power was seized by Phalaris ( c. 570 -554 ), who is described as a τυacuteραννος εκ τῶν τι µ ῶν by Arist. Pol . 1310 b 28 . His reign was a period of expansion, with several victories over the indigenous population, in particular the victory over the Sikanian stronghold of Uessa (Polyaen. 5 . 1 . 4 ), and the conquest of Minoa; the Akragantine dedication to Athena Lindia of a palladion was booty taken from this town (Lind. Chron. ( FGrHist 532 ) fr. 30 = Xenagoras ( FGrHist 240 ) fr. 30 ). Phalaris may have extended Akragantine influence to Himera (no. 24 ), see Arist. Rh . 1393 b 11 ff., who reports that the Himeraians chose him as στρατηγοgraveς αυτοκράτωρ . The rule of Phalaris was followed by those of Alkamenes and Alkandros (Heracl. Lemb. 69 ). Though there may have been a democracy in existence before the tyranny of Theron (E. W. Robinson ( 1997 ) 78 -80 , based on Diod. 11 . 48 . 6 -8 ), tyranny persisted at Akragas during C5f, and Theron ( 489 / 8 -473 / 2 ), variously described as µ ουacuteναρχος (Hdt. 7 . 165 ) or βασιλευacuteς (Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 93 ), with Gelon defeated the Carthaginians and their ally Terillos at Himera in 480 (Hdt. 7 . 166 ; Diod. 11 . 20 -22 ); Theron's son Thrasydaios was installed as tyrant in Himera (Diod. 11 . 48 . 6 ). Theron died after a reign of sixteen years and was honoured as a hero (Diod. 11 . 53 . 1 -2 ); he was succeeded by Thrasydaios in Akragas (Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 93 ), who for a year exercised power παρανό µ ως καιgrave τυραννικῶς (Diod. 11 . 53 . 3 ). The subsequent conflict with Hieron and the fall of Thrasydaios led to the establishment of a democratic government in 471 (Diod. 11 . 53 . 5 ) and the return to their native country of the αρχαῖοι πολῖται , who were given back their civic rights (Diod. 11 . 76 . 5 ). Empedokles is reported (by Diog. Laert. 8 . 66 = Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 2 ) to have put an end to an oligarchy 'of the 1 , 000 ' ( τοgrave τῶν χιλίων άθροισ µ α ) which had existed for three years, but refused the offer of βασιλεία (Xanthos ( FGrHist 765 ) fr. 33 ; Arist. fr. 865 ), thereby obtaining a cessation of stasis and bringing about political equality (Neanthes ( FGrHist 84 ) fr. 28 ). Exactly when this occurred is uncertain, but E. W. Robinson ( 1997 ) 78 -80 assumes that it was some years after the fall of the tyranny, possibly c. 454 -442 , and if so the city experienced a three-year oligarchic interlude. Akragas took part in the war against Douketios (Diod. 11 . 91 . 3 -4 (r 451 )). The rivalry with Syracuse led to a war which involved allies on both sides and ended in an Akragantine defeat at Himera, with envoys concluding peace at Syracuse (Diod. 12 . 8 . 2 -4 (r 446 ), 26 . 3 ). The Athenian expedition to Sicily in 422 led to an alliance between Athens (no. 361 ) and Akragas in 422 (Thuc. 5 . 4 . 6 ); Akragas hindered the passage through its territory of troops allied with Syracuse (no. 47 ) in 415 (Thuc. 7 . 32 . 1 ) and remained neutral (Thuc. 7 . 33 . 2 , 58 . 1 ); following a stasis , citizens friendly to Syracuse were expelled (Thuc. 7 . 50 . 1 ). In C5l Akragas became involved in the Carthaginian invasion of Sicily. It did not succeed in bringing help to Selinous (no. 44 ) in 409 (Diod. 13 . 56 . 1 ), but received the survivors (Diod. 13 . 58 . 3 ). In its turn Akragas was besieged and taken by the Carthaginians in 406 (Diod. 13 . 85 -89 ). The inhabitants took refuge first at Gela (no. 17 ) and afterwards at Leontinoi (no. 33 ; Diod. 13 . 89 -90 ), and the city itself was destroyed by Himilkon (Diod. 13 . 108 . 2 ). The prosperity brought by the reign of Timoleon led to the refoundation of Akragas by Megillos and Pheristos of Hyele (Plut. Tim . 35 . 2 ; for the problem of an Ionian city refounding a Dorian city, see Talbert ( 1974 ) 204 -5 ). The existence of archontes , boule and dikasterion is attested for C5 (Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 134 = Diog. Laert. 8 . 64 ; cf. Asheri ( 1992 a )). Strategoi and the ekklesia are attested for 406 (Diod. 87 . 4 -5 ). The passing of a decree preparing for resistance against Carthage is mentioned in Diod. 13 . 81 . 2 (r 406 ). In 356 / 5 a citizen of Akragas served as theorodokos of Epidauros (no. 348 ; IG iv² . 1 95 . ii . 91 ), and c. 331 -324 one of its citizens was appointed proxenos by Athens (no. 361 ; Hesperia 43 ( 1974 ) 322 , no. 3 ). Reception of envoys is attested at Diod. 11 . 68 . 1 (r 466 ); the sending of envoys is attested in Diod. 12 . 8 . 4 (r 446 ). The city was surrounded on the west by the river Hypsas and on the east by the river Akragas, with their confluence just below the city.Ancient remains at the estuary may attest harbour structures (Waele ( 1971 ) 4 ), and a small coastal trading station (serving as a harbour, cf. epineion at Strabo 6 . 2 . 5 ), contemporary with the foundation of Akragas, is inferred from the vast C6e-C5 cemetery on the Montelusa hill near the coast (De Miro ( 1988 b ) 240 -44 ; earlier research: Waele ( 1971 ) 6 ). Akragas lay about 4 km from the coast on a low sloping plateau surrounded on the north, east and south by a ridge of hills, the northernmost of which may have been the acropolis with a temple of Athena, the eastern and southern hills being occupied by other important sanctuaries. The steep slopes created natural defences, in part strengthened by walls raised on the crest of the hills (Polyb. 9 . 27 . 3 -4 ). The C6e circuit wall was built in local limestone in an ashlar technique.Eight or nine gates gave access to the city at natural openings in the ridge of hills (cf. P . Marconi ( 1929 ) 32 -41 , fig. 15 ). Diod. 13 . 81 . 3 refers to τείχη in reference to 406 when it was decided to evacuate the territory and take refuge behind the fortifications. The hill of Athena, used as a retreat during the assault of the Carthaginians (Diod. 13 . 85 . 4 (r 406 )), is normally interpreted as the acropolis of the city (Polyb. 9 . 27 . 6 ). Polyb. 9 . 27 . 7 locates the temples of Athena and Zeus Atabyrios on the highest point of the city, but whether the Athenaion (probably the sanctuary of Athena Polias) and the temple of Zeus were located on the highest point of the mediaeval city of Girgenti or further south on the 'Rupe Atenea'hill is still not clear; also all of the hills in the north and north-east may have constituted a single acropolis (Waele ( 1971 ) 217 -22 ). Akragas presents one of the most impressive examples of Sicilian urban planning. Although the fully excavated insulae are mainly of later date, the urban layout of the Archaic and Classical city may be reconstructed as an orthogonally planned city with plateiai oriented east-west, and stenopoi oriented north-south; investigations in the habitation area west of the Olympieion point to C6s-C5e for the overall urban layout (De Miro ( 1980 ) 711 -15 , ( 1992 ) 155 ). The northwestern part of the city had a slightly different orientation. The urban area comprised c. 625 ha including the surrounding hills, while the habitation area on the plateau comprised c. 140 ha (Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 5 ). C5f witnessed significant building activity at Akragas (see e.g.Diod. 11 . 25 ), with several allusions to the high standard of living of the inhabitants (e.g. Heraclid. Pont. fr. 76 , Wehrli; Diod. 13 . 81 . 4 -5 ). The bouleuterion and the ekklesiasterion were situated centrally in the urban layout on the small hill of S. Nicola (De Miro ( 1988 a ) 66 , fig. 2 ). The hill was laid out as a sanctuary in C6 , but from the C4 became the focus of civic structures, perhaps with a surrounding agora. The C4l bouleuterion , replacing C6 -C4 temples, was built on the northern part of the hill on an artificial terrace supported by a new,monumental terrace wall which endows the area with some monumentality. The seating capacity was c. 300 (De Miro ( 1985 -86 )). The ekklesiasterion was situated south of the bouleuterion on the southern slope of the S. Nicola hill (De Miro ( 1988 a ) 66 , fig. 2 ). The koilon , covering about 1 , 250 m ² , had a seating capacity of c. 3 , 000 (Hansen and FischerHansen ( 1994 ) 57 with refs.). The excavators date the structure to C4 -C3 , though earlier dates have been suggested, such as the period of the refoundation of Akragas by Timoleon, 339 (cf. Plut. Tim . 35 . 2 ), or even C5 (Greco and Theodorescu ( 1983 ) 45 , 79 ). The open space north-east of the Olympieion sanctuary has tentatively been identified with a lower, mercantile(?) agora (Fiorentini ( 1990 ) 17 ). Stoas are now known from the early urban history (De Miro ( 1977 ) 95 -96 ). The remains of a theatre(?) mentioned byFazello (sixteenth century ad ) is surmised in the S.Nicola area, near the other public buildings, but there are no remains. A C5fountain house was part of the sanctuary of Demeter below the Rupe Atenea (Siracusano ( 1983 )). Public works begun after the victory at Himera in 480 included underground conduits to carry waste water away from the city constructed by the architect Phaeax. The 'swimmingbath' , kolumbethra , mentioned by Diodorus, seven stades in circumference, probably fed the water supply of the city (Diod. 11 . 25 . 3 -4 (r 480 ); cf. also Waele ( 1971 ) 52 , 113 ; Wilson ( 2000 ) 7 ). The sources refer to cults of Zeus, Hera, Apollo, Athena, Demeter,Kore and Hermes (Waele ( 1971 ) 185 -207 ). The epithet of the Athena of the sanctuary located on the acropolis (Diod. 13 . 85 . 4 ; Polyb. 9 . 27 . 7 ; supra ) is uncertain. The Geloan-Rhodian origin of the settlers may suggest Lindia, but in Polyaen. 6 . 51 we have Polias. A Rhodian origin of the major city cults is corroborated by the Rhodian origin of the cult of Zeus Atabyrios located on the acropolis (Polyb. 9 . 27 . 7 ).According to Polyaen. 5 . 1 . 1 , a temple was dedicated to Zeus Polieus, but it is most likely the same cult. A cult of Demeter is known from Pind. Pyth . 12 . 1 -2 and from Polyaen. 5 . 1 . 1 (a thesmophorion ). The cult statue of Apollo in a suburban Asklepieion (Polyb. 1 . 18 . 2 ) was the work of Myron (Cic. Verr . 4 . 43 . 93 ). A survey of the remains of the urban sanctuaries comprises the following: C5e remains of a Doric temple (temple 'E') partly incorporated in the Christian basilica of S.Maria dei Greci, in the mediaeval city of Girgenti, possibly the temple of Athena Polias (P. Marconi ( 1929 ) 77 -80 ; Waele ( 1971 ) 110 ). Rupe Atenea: at S. Biagio, a C5e naiskos (temple 'C') dedicated to Demeter (P. Marconi ( 1929 ) 66 -72 ; Waele ( 1971 ) 199 -200 ; Hinz ( 1998 ) 74 -79 ). The row of sanctuaries on the southern crest of the city, from east to west: temple 'D', C5m, cult unknown (P. Marconi ( 1929 ) 72 -76 ); temple 'F' , C5s, cult unknown (ibid. 80 -86 ); 'Tempietto di Villa Aurea' , C6l, cult unknown (ibid. 46 ); temple 'A' , C6l, cult unknown (ibid. 51 -57 ; T. Van Compernolle ( 1989 ) 51 -54 ); Olympieion (temple 'B'), 480 -c. 440 (?) (Diod. 13 . 81 . 1 -4 ; Polyb. 9 . 27 . 9 ; Marconi ( 1929 ) 57 -66 ; Bell ( 1980 ); T. Van Compernolle ( 1989 ) 60 -68 , ( 1992 ) 62 -67 ). Archaic architectural terracottas from east of the Olympieion are taken as evidence of an Archaic sanctuary in the vicinity, unknown cult (P . Marconi ( 1929 ) 46 , 155 -56 ).A sanctuary to the west of the Olympieion at gate 5 ; a C6s temple in antis and a 'lesche' or oikos , from the C5sanctuary enlarged with a stoa or porticus and other buildings (De Miro ( 1977 ) 94 -100 ). Further west, the C5l temple 'G'; in the cella, remains were found of an earlier Archaic naiskos (P. Marconi ( 1929 ) 86 -87 ). Near the sanctuary of the chthonic divinities (Waele ( 1971 ) 195 -99 ; Hinz ( 1998 ) 79 -90 ): temple 'I' , C5m; north of this, remains of two C6 naiskoi possibly superseded by temple 'I' in C5m. The central part of the city, the S. Nicola hill, was laid out as a sanctuary with at least two temples in the Archaic period; the structure of one was partly reused in a C4e naiskos , the cult was possibly that of Demeter (Polacco ( 1988 ); Hinz ( 1998 ) 90 -91 ). The identification of the C5s suburban sanctuary located between the city and the coast (P. Marconi ( 1929 ) 87 -93 ) as that of Asklepios rests upon Polyb. 1 . 18 . 2 , but must remain uncertain. The only cemetery of the city itself yet examined in any detail is that of Contrada Pezzino west of the city, dating from the period of the foundation to C5l, and again from C4s (De Miro ( 1989 )). Further cemeteries were dispersed along the roads leading south and east from the city. Xenokrates won a Pythian victory in 490 (Pind. Pyth . 6 ) and an Isthmian victory in, presumably, 472 (Pind. Isth . 2 ); Exainetos ( 496 ), Empedokles ( 496 ) and Theron ( 476 ) won in the Olympic Games ( Olympionikai 167 , 170 , 220 ), and Exainetos ( Olympionikai 341 , 346 ) was particularly honoured in 412 when he entered the city in a chariot and was escorted by all the chariots of the Akragantines, 300 chariots each drawn by two white horses (Diod. 13 . 82 . 7 ). According to Pausanias, Akragas set up a bronze group in Olympia to commemorate a C5e(?) defeat of the Phoenicians at Motya (Paus. 5 . 25 . 5 ; cf. LSAG 274 ), and a statue of Apollo was dedicated at Delphi 475 -450 : Ακραγαντῖνοι τ [ ˜ οι Απόλ ] λονι (Bousquet ( 1959 ) 149 -50 ). For the dedication of the spoils taken at Minoa to Athena Lindia by the Akragantines, see supra . Akragas initiated coinage c. 520 / 510 with an issue of didrachms on the Attic standard: obv . eagle standing in profile, legends: ΑΚΡΑΓΑΝΤΟΣ , or, later, ΑΚΡΑ , ΑΚΡΑΓΑΣ (see Brugnone ( 1978 ) for the use of the sign Λ = alpha ); rev . crab with, on some later groups, officials' names or abbreviations. The terminal date of the first issue is a little before 470 (Jenkins ( 1970 ) 162 -64 ; C. Boehringer ( 1984 -85 ) 119 -22 ; SNG Cop. Sicily 20 -40 ). The tetradrachm replaced the didrachm as the main denomination c. 464 : main types as above,legend: ΑΚΡΑΓΑΝΤΟΣ ( SNG.Cop. Sicily 41 -45 ); also lower denominations based on the litra ( SNG Cop. Sicily 46 -51 ). Just before its destruction in 406 , Akragas struck sophisticated issues, some signed, and some issues now used the city-ethnic as legend: ΑΚΡΑΓΑΝΤΙΝΟΝ ( SNG Cop. Sicily 53 ), while ΑΚΡΑΓΑΝΤΙΝΩΝ is found in C4l-C3e. Rare gold issues from the same period ( SNG Cop.Sicily 52 ) may reflect minting in response to the need to pay mercenaries (cf. Gela (no. 17 )). The first bronze coinage of Akragas, from c. 430 , was cast shapes (Westermark ( 1979 ); SNG Cop. Sicily 61 -63 ); later coins were struck in bronze; types: obv . eagle; rev . crab, some inscribed ΑΚΡΑΓΑΝΤΙΝΟΝ (Vassallo ( 1983 ); Westermark ( 1984 ); SNG Cop. Sicily 65 -90 ). The city as refounded by Timoleon c. 338 struck symmachia coins of the free horse type (Karlsson ( 1995 ) 161 ; SNG Cop. Sicily 91 -92 )."
10,Akrai (Akraios),Sikelia,37.05,14.55,745,3752,"10 . Akrai (Akraios) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 05 , long. 14 . 55 . Size of territory: ? Type: C: α . The toponym is Αacuteκραι , αιasper (Thuc. 6 . 5 . 2 ; Diod. 23 . 4 . 1 ); Steph. Byz. 62 . 5 has Αacuteκρα ; the cityethnic is Ακραῖος ( IG xiv 215 . 3 (C3 )). The only (implicit) reference to Akrai as a polis is in the treaty of 263 between Rome and Syracuse (Diod. 23 . 4 . 1 ), which lists the poleis assigned to Hieron II and uses polis in the political sense. The internal collective use of the cityethnic is found in IG xiv 215 ; it is also found as the epithet of Zeus Akraios, if the conjecture by Wilamowitz is accepted ( IG xiv 203 ). Lack of the name of an oecist and of a mint are factors which make the polis status of Akrai uncertain and tend to suggest a military settlement protecting the territory of Syracuse (no. 47 ; Di Vita ( 1956 ), ( 1987 )) rather than a polis . There are very few sources for the Archaic and Classical periods, and no mention of the city from between the period of its foundation (Thuc. 6 . 5 . 2 ) and the encampment of Dion in its vicinity (Plut. Dio 27 (r 357 )). All in all, the status of Akrai seems uncertain. Thucydides uses the toponym without qualification, implying, perhaps, a phrourion controlling Syracusan dominion, though it may possibly have been a dependent polis founded as a fortress (as has been suggested for Kasmenai (no. 29 ) by Hansen ( 1997 a ) 36 ). Akrai was founded by Syracuse (no. 47 ) in 664 (Thuc. 6 . 5 . 2 ) c. 36 km west of Syracuse itself, as the outcome of Syracuse's policy of subjugating a large part of south-east Sicily (Di Vita ( 1987 )). There is evidence for small nucleated settlements and farmsteads in the hinterland (Curcio ( 1979 ) 87 -88 ; Marotta D'Agata et al . ( 1994 ) 196 ), but the size of Akraian territory is uncertain, and it was in any case part of the Syracusan dominion.A C4 relief of Demeter and Apollo from Serra Palazzo, a few kilometres from Akrai, may indicate a suburban sanctuary (Orsi ( 1920 )). Akrai occupied a plateau west of modern Palazzolo Acreide between the upper reaches of the Tellaro and Anapo valleys. The city was defended by steep slopes and a circuit wall raised on the edge of the plateau. Only short stretches are extant, built as a solid ashlar wall dated to C4f (Bernabò Brea ( 1956 ) 21 -25 , fig. 9 ). IG xiv 217 (Hell.) mentions a pyla Selinountia (Pugliese Carratelli in Bernabò Brea ( 1956 ) 2 ; Manganaro ( 1965 ) 204 -5 supplies an alternative reading). The urban site occupied the central part of the plateau, covering about 35 ha (Bernabò Brea ( 1956 )). Evidence for the early urban history of Akrai is limited, early remains being sparse. The most conspicuous remains are the C3 theatre (Mitens ( 1988 ) 84 -87 ) and the C2 bouleuterion (Gneisz ( 1990 ) 302 ). However,there are traces of early town planning which may go back to the time of foundation (Voza and Lanza ( 1994 )). The east-west plateia spans the whole city from the Syracusan gate in the area of the probable agora, the theatre and bouleuterion to the Selinountine gate. The C6s temple of Aphrodite on a hill above the city has a history going back to C7m (Bernabò Brea ( 1986 ); for the attribution: IG xiv 206 , 208 ). There is epigraphic evidence for cults of Hera ( IG xiv 208 ), Zeus Akraios ( IG xiv 203 : ∆ιός [ Αγο ] ραίου , emended to [ Ακ ] ραίου by Wilamowitz),Artemis ( IG xiv 217 ) and Kore ( IG xiv 217 ; cf. Hinz ( 1998 ) 119 ). See further Pugliese Carratelli ( 1956 ) and Bernabò Brea ( 1986 ) 13 . The cemeteries of Akrai are located on the adjoining plateau south of the city, Contrada della Pineta (in use C7 -C5 ) and on the Colle Orbo, located above the city outside the west gate (C7 and C6 ; Bernabò Brea ( 1956 ) 114 -17 )."
11,Alaisa (Alaisinos),Sikelia,38.0,14.15,450,2347,"11 . Alaisa (Alaisinos) Map 47 . Lat. 38 . 00 , long. 14 . 15 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: β . The toponym is Αasperacuteλαισα , ηasper (Diod. 14 . 16 . 2 , 4 ). The city-ethnic is Αλαισῖνος (C4m coins, infra ; Diod. 23 . 4 . 1 ). According to Diod. 14 . 16 . 2 , Alaisa was founded by Archonides of Herbita in 403 / 2 , in order to house veteran mercenaries, a symmikton ochlon that the war against Dionysios had brought to the city, as well as poor citizens of Herbita (no. 23 ) itself; in the report of the foundation,Alaisa is called a polis ( πόλιν έκτισεν Αasperacuteλαισαν ), presumably in both the urban and the political sense. Another tradition held that it was a foundation by Himilkon of Carthage (Diod. 14 . 16 . 4 ). In the Roman period,however,the Herbitan origin of the city was considered a disgrace by its citizens (Diod. 14 . 16 . 3 ), and this may explain the variant tradition. The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4s coins ( infra ), and the external collective use in Diod. 23 . 4 . 1 (r 263 ). Alaisa was member of Timoleon's symmachia (cf. Diod. 16 . 73 . 2 (r 342 / 1 )), as can be inferred from its minting of Timoleontic symmachia coins ( infra ). Alaisa is identified with Castel di Tusa on the north coast of Sicily, where there are substantial remains of an ancient urban site: habitation structures that reveal an orthogonal layout with an agora; a circuit wall in ashlar technique; a monumental stoa; and remains of two temples, of which one must have been of Apollo ( infra ), all Heltic (Scibona ( 1976 b )). The epiklesis of Apollo-Archagetas ( infra )-is testimony to the importance of his cult. Alaisa struck Greek-style bronze coins from the time of Timoleon's symmachia ( c. 340 ): obv . Apollo, legend: ΑΡΧΑΓΕΤΑΣ ; rev . torch and stalks of barley, legend: ΣΥΜΜΑΧΙΚΟΝ ( SNG Cop. Sicily 132 ); also Zeus Eleutherios type: obv . head of Zeus Eleutherios with short hair, legend: ΖΕΥΣ ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΙΟΣ ; rev . torch between ears of corn, legend: ΑΛΑΙΣΙΝΩΝ ΣΥΜΜΑΧΙΚΟΝ . Other types depict Apollo (legend: ΑΡΧΑΓΕΤΑΣ ) and the nymph Sikelia (legend: ΣΙΚΕΛΙΑ ). Lower bronze denominations have obv . griffin, rev . free horse, legend: ΚΑΙΝΟΝ ( SNG Cop. Sicily 132 -34 ). See Head, HN ² 125 -26 ; Talbert ( 1974 ) 188 -89 ; Bernabò Brea ( 1975 ) 21 ; Karlsson ( 1995 ) 150 , 165 n. 3 with refs."
12,Alontion (Alontinos),Sikelia,38.05,14.4,266,1359,"12 . Alontion (Alontinos) Map 47 . Lat. 38 . 05 , long. 14 . 40 . Size of territory: ? Type: C: γ . The toponym is Αλοντίον , τό (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 1 . 51 . 2 ; Ptol. Geog . 3 . 4 . 2 ). The cityethnic is Αλοντῖνος (C4e coins, infra ). Nosource calls Alontion a polis , but it is included here on account of its C4e coins. According to legend, Patron of Akarnania, guide of Anchises (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 1 . 51 . 2 ; for the Akarnanian origin of Patron, cf. Fromentin ( 1998 ) 256 ad Dion.Hal. Ant. Rom . 1 . 51 . 2 ), settled at Alontion, which would seem to indicate a claim to Greek identity, and by C4e it minted Greekstyle coins ( infra ). Alontion has been identified with San Marco d'Alunzio (Bruno ( 1963 ) 141 -48 ), in origin a Sikel site, but with some evidence of C4 Helation. The few documented Greek structures are the remains of a (probably Heltic) circuit wall built in isodomic technique and a suburban temple. In addition, coin types suggest cults of Greek divinities ( infra ). Alontion struck bronze coins from C4e: obv . head of Athena; rev . cuttlefish, legend: ΑΛΟΝΤΙΝΟΝ . According to Karlsson ( 1995 ) 150 , fig. 3 , Alontion issued Timoleontic symmachia coins with the short-haired Zeus Eleutherios (but no refs. are given, ibid. 166 n. 3 ); Rutter ( 1997 ) 168 includes Alontion in his list of C4s Timoleontic symmachia coins."
13,Apollonia (Apolloniates),Sikelia,38.0,14.35,252,1277,"13 . Apollonia (Apolloniates) Map 47 . Lat. 38 . 00 , long. 14 . 35 . Size of territory: ? Type: C: α ? The toponym is Απολλωνία , ηasper (Diod. 16 . 72 . 5 ). The city-ethnic is Απολλωνιάτης (Diod. 16 . 72 . 5 ). At 16 . 72 . 5 , Diodorus reports that Apollonia, which with Engyon (no. 14 ) had been ruled by the tyrant Leptines, had its autonomia restored by Timoleon in 342 / 1 ; in his brief report of the incident,Diodorus refers to Apollonia as a polis in the political sense and uses the collective city-ethnic; it is called a polis in the urban sense at Diod. 20 . 56 . 4 (r 307 ). According to Steph. Byz. 106 . 4 -5 (as emended by Clüver), Apollonia was located near Kale Akte and Alontion (i.e. on the north coast of Sicily), and urban remains on the plateau of Monte Vecchio,Commune of S.Fratello,have been identifed with Apollonia; the remains testify to circuit walls and habitation structures built in isodomic masonry of local marble (Bernabò Brea ( 1975 ) 15 ; Scibona ( 1976 a )). However, Manni ( 1981 ) 145 opts for modern Pollina, pointing out that according to Diod. 16 . 72 . 5 , Apollonia was near Engyon. According to Diod. 20 . 56 . 4 , the city was taken by Agathokles in 307 after a short siege, and this suggests that it was fortified by this date."
14,Engyon (Engyinos),Sikelia,37.45,14.35,344,1666,"14 . Engyon (Engyinos) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 45 , long. 14 . 35 . Size of territory: ? Type: C: α . The toponym is /acuteΕγγυον , τό (Diod. 16 . 72 . 3 ; Steph. Byz. 271 . 13 , for which see Meineke ad loc .). The city-ethnic is ' Εγγυῖνος (Diod. 16 . 72 . 4 , 6 ) and ' Εκγυ ( ῖνος ?, cf. infra ). Engyon is called a polis in the urban and political (cf. τυραννου µ ένη ) senses at Diod. 16 . 72 . 4 (r 342 / 1 ) in a passage which also uses the collective city-ethnic (cf. 16 . 72 . 6 ). In 342 / 1 , the city was ruled by the tyrant Leptines, who was, however, deposed when Timoleon restored the autonomia of Engyon (Diod. 16 . 72 . 3 -5 ). According to Diod. 4 . 79 . 7 , the famous sanctuary of the Meteres at Engyon was of Cretan origin (Manganaro ( 1996 c ) 130 n. 13 with refs.), perhaps an indication that Greek identity was claimed for the city ( infra ). The location of Engyon is uncertain, though we are told that the neighbouring city was Agyrion (no. 7 ), located 100 stades away (Diod. 4 . 80 . 5 ). Manganaro has, on the basis of Heltic inscriptions ( φα [ τία ] ' Εκγυ [ ίνων ]?) on bullets found at Troina,suggested this as the site of Engyon, and the possible attestation of a civic organisation with phratriai is of some importance as an indication of Greek identity (Manganaro ( 1964 b ), ( 1996 c ) 130 ; contra Manni ( 1976 b ) 606 -7 ). At Troina,the archaeological remains of a circuit wall and the evidence from tombs do not antedate C4m; there is no evidence of an original Sikel settlement. However,the identification of Troina with Engyon (accepted by Barr .) cannot be considered absolutely certain (Militello ( 1961 ); Bejor ( 1989 a ))."
15,Euboia (Euboeus),Sikelia,,,582,3101,"15 . Euboia (Euboeus) Map 47 . Unlocated. Type: C: α . The toponym is Ευacuteβοια , ηasper (Callim. Aet . II fr. 43 . 52 , Pfeiffer; Ps.-Skymnos 287 ; cf. Freeman ( 1891 -94 ) i. 380 : 'Its name, recording the home-memories of the men of Leontinoi,is the earliest distinct instance of the name of a land being used as the name of a town; for there was a town as well as an island of Naxos, but there was no town of Euboia'); in Hdt. 7 . 156 . 3 the city-ethnic is given as Ευβοευacuteς (to which is added οasper εasperν Σικελίηsubiotaη ; cf. Camassa ( 1989 a ) 391 -92 : 'uno specifico riferimento agli abitanti del centro [i.e. the city of Euboia] e non . . . una designazione dei coloni d'ascendenza euboica in Sicilia'). The site of Euboia is unidentified, but it was presumably located somewhere in the hinterland of Leontinoi (no. 33 ) where the presence of Chalkidian Greeks is well documented (Procelli ( 1989 )). The city has been tentatively identified with different modern towns and localities (cf.Camassa ( 1989 a ) 392 ), most recently with the site of Monte San Mauro near Caltagirone (Frasca ( 1997 )). Barr . (following Manni ( 1981 )) suggests a location at the ACH site at Licodia Euboia. The only Classical source to mention Euboia is Hdt. 7 . 156 . 3 , which reports that Gelon subjected it to the same treatment as Megara, i.e. the pacheis received citizenship at Syracuse (no. 47 ) while the demos was sold into slavery; this ought to imply a Euboian population socially differentiated into pacheis and demos , and since the other communities relocated by Gelon were certainly poleis -viz . Kamarina (no. 28 ) and Megara (no. 36 )-the presumption is that Euboia was a polis as well (cf. Seibert ( 1979 ) 226 , 228 ). Strabo 10 . 1 . 15 also reports Gelon's relocation of the city and implies that it meant a change of status for Euboia: it became a Syracusan phrourion , and the inference is that it was a polis prior to that ( Ευacuteβοια . . . ηaspergraveν Γέλων εξανέστησε , καιgrave εγένετο φρουacuteριον Συρακοσίων ; cf. the entry for Leontinoi, which became a phrourion of Syracuse in the later 420 s). Euboia is called a polis by Ps.-Skymnos 287 in reference to the time of foundation. The external collective use of the city-ethnic is found at Hdt. 7 . 156 . 3 . Only two events of Euboian history are known: its foundation and its destruction. It was founded by Leontinoi (no. 33 ) (Strabo 6 . 2 . 6 ). The date of the foundation is unknown and must be inferred from the context in which the literary sources mention it: Strabo 6 . 2 . 6 discusses its foundation together with the foundations of Himera (no. 24 ), Kallipolis (no. 27 ) and Selinous (no. 44 ), which may suggest a C7 date for the foundation; however, Ps.-Skymnos 287 -88 treats the foundation alongside that of Mylai, so a C8l date cannot be entirely excluded. Euboia's existence as a polis ended when c. 485 -483 Gelon sold its demos into slavery and relocated the pacheis to Syracuse (Hdt. 7 . 156 . 3 ; chronology: Dunbabin ( 1948 ) 416 ); after that it was a Syracusan phrourion (Strabo 10 . 1 . 15 )."
16,Galeria (Galarinos),Sikelia,,,306,1505,"16 . Galeria (Galarinos) Map 47 . Unlocated (Manni ( 1981 ) 175 -76 ; Scibona ( 1989 ) 536 ). Type: C: β . The toponym is Γαλερία or Γαλαρία , ηasper at Diod. 16 . 67 . 3 , 19 . 104 . 1 ; the cityethnic is Γαλαρῖνος (C5m coins, infra ). Galeria is called a polis in the urban and political senses at Diod. 16 . 67 . 3 (r 345 / 4 ); politai are mentioned at Diod. 19 . 104 . 1 (r 312 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C5m coins ( infra ). According to Steph. Byz. 196 . 11 , Galeria was a foundation by the Sikel Morgos; it is included here on account of its Greek-inspired coinage ( infra ). Reception of an embassy is implied by Diod. 16 . 67 . 3 (r 345 / 4 ): Entella sent for help against the Carthaginians, and Galeria responded by sending 1 , 000 hoplites, who were all killed. Galeria struck two distinct issues of silver litrai. The earlier issue dates to C5m: obv . Zeus seated on throne holding eagle-tipped sceptre,legend: ΣΟΤΕΡ ; rev . Dionysos standing, holding kantharos and vine, legend: ΓΑΛΑ . The iconography is known from coins of Aitna (no. 8 ) and Naxos (no. 41 ), but the style is indigenous. A later issue dates to 430 -420 and is known from three specimens: obv . Dionysos holding kantharos and thyrsos; rev . vine and bunch of grapes, legend: ΓΑΛΑΡΙΝΟΝ (Head, HN ² 139 ; Jenkins ( 1975 ) 83 -85 ; Marwitz ( 1982 ) 56 ; Cutroni Tusa ( 1984 -85 ) 290 ). The type depicting Zeus Soter seems to indicate a Greek cult (Gabrici ( 1959 ) 19 ; Marwitz ( 1982 ))."
17,"Gela (Geloios, Geloaios)",Sikelia,37.05,14.15,2862,14573,"17 . Gela (Geloios, Geloaios) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 05 , long. 14 . 15 . Size of territory: 4 in C7 ; for the C6 -C5e dominion,see below. Type: A: α . The toponym is Γέλη , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 153 . 1 ) or Γέλα ( F.Delphes iii . 4 452 ( c. 474 ); Thuc. 4 . 58 ). The uncontracted city-ethnic is Γελοαῖος ( IGDS no. 132 ( 550 -525 )), contracted to ΓελΑsubiotaῶος (Hdt. 7 . 154 . 1 ; Thuc. 7 . 58 . 1 ; IGDS no. 158 (C5e)); the form Γελεαῖος is found in SEG 24 303 (C6 -C5 ), possibly an Ionic form, but see IGDS notes ad 132 and Cordiano ( 1995 ), who suggests reading Γaltελεάτας , i.e. the city-ethnic of Hyele (no. 54 ), not Gela. Gela is called polis in the political sense by Thuc. 6 . 4 . 3 , and in the urban sense by Thuc. 6 . 4 . 3 and Theopomp. fr. 358 . Polites occurs at Hdt. 7 . 155 . 1 and astos at Hdt. 7 . 156 . 2 . Its politeia was described by Aristotle (Arist. fr. 491 ). A C5 bronze weight is inscribed δα µ οσ &lt; ί &gt; α ( IGDS no. 152 ). It is called patris in Empedokles fr. 156 . 4 (DK). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found in IGDS no. 153 (C5e) and on C5 coins ( infra ). The external collective use is found in Hdt. 7 . 156 . 2 and Thuc. 7 . 58 . 1 ; the external individual use is found in IGDS no. 132 ( 550 -525 ), IvO 142 ( c. 488 ) and IG ii² 8460 (C4e). Gela was founded 45 years after Syracuse, i.e. in 689 / 8 , by colonists from Rhodos and Crete (Thuc. 6 . 4 . 3 ); according to Hdt. 7 . 153 . 1 by Lindians (no. 997 ) from Rhodos. The oecists were the Rhodian Antiphemos and the Cretan Entimos (Thuc. 6 . 4 . 3 ; cf. the C6 -C5 dedication to Antiphemos: IGDS no. 135 , indicating a cult of the oecist (Orlandini ( 1968 ) 44 -46 )). The colonists instituted νό µ ι µ α ∆ωρικά at Gela (Thuc. 6 . 4 . 3 ). Early Geloan expansion into the hinterland may be inferred from the sack of Omphake, a πόλισ µ α Σικανῶν , by Antiphemos (Paus. 8 . 46 . 2 (rC7 )); and conflicts between Geloans and the indigenous population are attested in other sources, e.g. Artemon ( FGrHist 569 ) fr. 1 and the Lindian Temple Chronicle 25 = Xenagoras ( FGrHist 240 ) fr. 12 , which mentions an ακροθίνιον εξ Αριαίτου dedicated to Athena Lindia by the Geloans.It was probably this expansionist policy that led to the foundation of Akragas (no. 9 ), which was founded 108 years after Gela's own foundation, i.e. c. 580 (Thuc. 6 . 4 . 4 ; cf. Pind. Ol . 2 . 93 with schol. 576 ). The plateau of Gela dominated the coastal plain and the vast inland lowland. Apparently, the plain was mainly agricultural and without settlements. It was delimited by a row of hills settled with indigenous sites which all came under Geloan influence in C7f, soon after the foundation of Gela. Two of the larger cities were Omphake (perhaps modern Butera: see most recently Adamesteanu ( 1994 -95 ) 113 ), subjected by Gela early on ( supra ), and Maktorion (possibly modern Monte Bubbonia: Bejor ( 1991 ) 305 ). The tracts along the valleys of the rivers Salso (ancient Himera), Dessueri and Maroglio (ancient Gela and its tributaries) came under Gela's influence from C6e, as far inland as Caltanisetta (sites of Sabucina; Gibil Gabib) and Caltagirone (site of Monte San Mauro, perhaps a Chalkidian settlement and therefore on the edge of the Geloan area of influence) (Orlandini ( 1962 ); see Euboia (no. 15 )). Eastwards the border between Gela and Kamarina (no. 28 ) was marked by the Dirillo valley, with a rural sanctuary at Feudo Nobile dedicated to chthonic divinities (Canzanella ( 1989 )). Westwards Geloan influence may have reached as far as the river Platani (ancient Halykos), the eastern frontier of Selinous (no. 44 ). In C7 the immediate hinterland of Gela comprised an area of about 375 km ² , but the period of Hippokrates and Gelon saw a Geloan dominion comprising large tracts of north-east (Chalkidian) and south-east (Syracusan) Sicily. Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 5 implies a C6m treaty of symmachia between Gela and Kamarina,and possibly between Gela and Syracuse (no. 47 ). From c. 505 , Gela was governed by tyrants, beginning with the rule of Kleandros and Hippokrates, sons of the Olympic victor Pantares ( Olympionikai 151 ). Kleandros was tyrant for seven years (Hdt. 7 . 154 . 1 ; Arist. Pol . 1316 a 37 ), and after him his brother Hippokrates took over τηgraveν µ ουναρχίην , also for seven years (Hdt. 7 . 155 . 1 ; cf. 6 . 23 . 3 and Thuc. 6 . 5 . 3 : τυacuteραννος ). Hippokrates conducted an aggressive foreign policy both against the indigenous population (Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 -3 ) and against the Greek cities of Kallipolis (no. 27 ), Naxos (no. 41 ), Zankle (no. 51 ) and Leontinoi (no. 33 ), all of which he 'enslaved' (Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 ). He also managed to defeat the Syracusans in battle and to lay siege to their city, but this conflict was settled through arbitration by Corinth (no. 227 ) and Korkyra (no. 123 ) by which Syracuse had to cede Kamarina to Hippokrates (Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 -3 ). Kamarina was then refounded by Gela with Hippokrates as oecist (Thuc. 6 . 5 . 3 ; Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 15 ). When Kamarina was destroyed by Gelon in 484 , the Geloans refounded it once again c. 461 (Thuc. 6 . 4 . 3 ; Diod. 11 . 76 . 5 ); see further Berve ( 1967 ) 137 -40 . Zankle and its ruler Skythes were dependent allies of Hippokrates (Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 ; see Zankle/Messana (no. 51 )). On Hippokrates' death, the citizens of Gela attempted to free themselves from tyranny, but Gelon, the former doryphoros of Hippokrates,defeated them in battle and took power (Hdt. 7 . 155 . 1 ). When in 485 Gelon became tyrant of Syracuse,he moved his seat as well as 'more than half'of the Geloan astoi to that city (Hdt. 7 . 156 . 2 ). The government of Gela was entrusted to Gelon's brother,Hieron (Hdt. 7 . 156 . 6 ), who later inherited the tyranny of Syracuse and was succeeded at Gela by another brother, Polyzalos ( F.Delphes iii . 4 452 : [ Γ ] έλας . . . α [ ν ] άσσ [ ον ]). Tyranny at Gela presumably came to an end in 466 / 5 (Berve ( 1967 ) 141 ). In 405 Himilkon besieged, pillaged and destroyed (?) Gela (Diod. 13 . 108 -111 . 1 -2 ), and after the defeat of Dionysios the peace treaty between Carthage and Syracuse (no. 47 ) stipulated that Gela be an ateichistos tributary of Carthage (Diod. 13 . 114 . 1 ; Staatsverträge 210 ). Gela was one of the Timoleontic refoundations (Plut. Tim . 35 . 1 -2 ; Talbert ( 1974 ) 153 -55 , 204 ). Our sources for the military strength of Gela provide us with scanty information about the size of the polis : a contingent of 500 hippeis is mentioned by Diod. 13 . 83 . 2 (rC5s; cf. Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 26 a). In 415 , during the Athenian attack, 200 Geloan cavalry assisted Syracuse (Thuc. 6 . 67 . 2 ), and the same number was sent in 413 (Thuc. 7 . 33 . 2 ). In 414 a small contingent from Gela under the command of Gylippos marched to the support of Syracuse (Thuc. 7 . 1 . 5 ), and in 413 a navy ( nautikon ) of five ships as well as 400 akontistai were sent to Syracuse (Thuc. 7 . 33 . 1 ). At the battle of Himera in 406 a contingent from Gela fought at the side of Kamarina (no. 28 ) and Syracuse (no. 47 ) (Diod. 13 . 86 . 5 ). A C6 -C5 Geloan defeat at the hands of Rhegion (no. 68 ) is attested by SEG 24 303 . Civil war is attested, as in all other major Sicilian poleis : an early stasis (C7 -C6 ) was resolved without bloodshed by an ancestor of Gelon (Hdt. 7 . 153 . 2 ). Another stasis , in which Dionysios I interfered, is mentioned for the year 406 : the demos rose against the despoteia of the dynatotatoi and succeeded owing to Dionysios' assistance; in this connection the ekklesia and psephismata are mentioned (Diod. 13 . 93 . 2 -4 ; Berger ( 1992 ) 23 -25 ). Diplomatic activities comprise reception of envoys (implied by Diod. 11 . 68 . 1 (r 466 )) as well as sending of envoys (Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 22 (r 424 ); Diod. 13 . 93 . 4 (r 406 )). In 424 , Gela hosted a pan-Sicilian peace congress, which had developed from an ekecheiria between Kamarina (no. 28 ) and Gela (Thuc. 5 . 58 , 65 ; Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 22 ). A Geloan served as Epidaurian theorodokos in 356 / 5 ( IG iv² . 1 95 . ii . 83 ). Another was appointed Samian proxenos in C4l ( IG xii . 6 33 ). The rulers of C5f Gela displayed their power at the Panhellenic sanctuaries.Gelon was victorious at Olympia in 484 ( Olympionikai 158 ; IvO 143 and Paus. 6 . 9 . 4 ; Harrell ( 2002 )); and Polyzalos was victor at Delphi c. 478 ( SEG 3 396 ; LSAG 266 , 275 no. 9 ; F.Delphes iii . 4 452 ; cf. Harrell ( 2002 ) 460 -62 ). For Gelon's donations at Delphi: Syll . ³ 33 -34 (cf. Harrell ( 2002 ) 453 -55 ). Gela had a thesauros at Olympia (Paus. 6 . 19 . 15 ), a richly furnished C6m building, restructured in C5f (Mertens-Horn and Viola ( 1990 ) 238 -39 ). Communal consultation of oracles is implied by Diod. 13 . 108 . 4 , which also attests to an internal communal dedication of a bronze image of Apollo. The city occupied the east-west-oriented coastal plateau, and during C7 -C5 a part of the lowland plain to the north (Spagnolo ( 1991 )). The easternmost part of the plateau, with C7sanctuaries, is normally regarded as the acropolis of the city (there is no ancient attestation of the term). The monumental C6 temple was replaced by a C5e temple located further east (Orlandini ( 1968 ) 21 -25 ; T. Van Compernolle ( 1989 ) 68 -69 ). The major divinity of the sanctuary was Athena, probably Athena Lindia (Fischer-Hansen ( 1996 ) 322 -27 with refs.). There are clear signs of some continuity of Greek occupation during the C4f and of continuity of cult. The central part of the plateau was probably the main habitation area in the Archaic and early Classical periods, delimited further to the west by the early cemeteries (Shepherd ( 1995 ) 60 -70 ). There is evidence of C8l Greek occupation, a pre-colonial phase apparently supporting the statement by Thuc. 6 . 4 . 3 that an area of Gela called Lindioi was occupied before the founding of Gela (for a colonisation of Gela in two phases, see Wentker ( 1956 ); Fiorentini and De Miro ( 1983 )). (Mortuary evidence, too, indicates a Greek presence from the end of C8 .) Architectural terracottas have revealed a large sanctuary, consisting of at least two monumental temples (Fischer-Hansen ( 1996 ) 327 -32 with refs.); the identity of the divinity is uncertain; Orlandini ( 1968 ) 31 suggests Zeus Atabyrios. No traces of a circuit wall from the period of foundation have been found so far, though the existence of-presumably early-walls is implied by Thuc. 6 . 4 . 3 . There are remains of a C6 circuit wall, possibly raised in connection with C6l civic strife (Orlandini ( 1961 ) 141 -44 ), or, if in part of later origin, in connection with the threat of the Carthaginians in C5l (De Miro and Fiorentini ( 1976 -77 ) 434 -35 ). Fortifications in C4l are attested by Diod. 19 . 107 . 5 (r 317 ) and 19 . 110 . 2 -3 (r 311 ). Little is known of the habitation area on the plateau (Buongiovanni and Canzanella ( 1990 ) 13 ). The Archaic city incorporated the north slope of the plateau and part of the plain below (Spagnolo ( 1991 )). The size of the Classical city, including a part of the lowland plains to the north but excluding the western cemetery and including the eastern sanctuary, was about 200 ha. There is clear evidence of the destruction by the Carthaginians in 405 , but also of a reestablishment of the Greek settlement soon after (Fiorentini ( 2002 )). The Timoleontic refoundation of Gela with a new overall urban plan comprised habitation quarters in terraces along the north slope and on part of the upper plateau, incorporating also a new industrial quarter, public baths and the western part of the plateau, enclosed by the impressive circuit walls at Capo Soprano (Buongiovanni and Canzanella ( 1990 ) 20 -22 ; Panvini ( 1996 ) 100 -20 ). There is further evidence of urban cults: a sanctuary on the southern slope was dedicated to Hera (Orlandini ( 1968 ) 31 -33 ; IGDS nos. 137 -38 ), and close by was the heroon for the oikistes Antiphemos ( supra ). Gela was surrounded by a number of suburban sanctuaries (surveys: Orlandini ( 1968 ); Fiorentini ( 1985 )), with paramount importance assigned to sanctuaries for Demeter (Kron ( 1992 ); Hinz ( 1998 ) 55 -69 ). Other sanctuaries, previously thought to be suburban, are now known to have been located within the northern boundary of the city (Orlandini ( 1968 ) pl. i . 5 . 6 ; Spagnolo ( 1991 ) 69 ). The stay of Aischylos at Gela surely implies that the city had a theatre in C5m. A C7 -C5 building complex located on the coast south-east of the plateau near the estuary of the river Gelas has been interpreted as harbour structures (Fiorentini ( 1985 ) 22 ; Panvini ( 1996 ) 54 -57 ). Gela began minting on the initiative of Gelon, c. 490 -485 . The first issue was of didrachms and tetradrachms on the Attic-Euboian standard, obv . naked rider; rev . forepart of man-headed bull, legends: ΓΕΛΑΣ (Jenkins ( 1970 ) 25 ). A second issue, mostly of tetradrachms, c. 480 -470 , is strongly influenced by the Syracusan mint and has obv . four-horse chariot with a flying Nike above; rev . forepart of man-faced bull,legends: ΓΕΛ , ΓΕΛΑΣ . Issues with the same obv . and rev . types, and variants including didrachms and drachms, are known until C5l ( SNG Cop.Sicily 251 -66 ); drachms have obv . legend ΓΕΛΟΙΟΝ (Jenkins ( 1970 ) 49 ). T etradrachms from c. 440 -430 have the standard rev . type, but a standing female figure crowns the bull's head with a wreath (a local nymph or water-goddess in the role of Nike?); legend: ΣΟΣΙΠΟΛΙΣ . The obv . type is very similar to obv . dies from Himera (Jenkins ( 1970 ) 71 -72 ). From c. 425 the tetradrachms carry the obv . legend ΓΕΛΩΙΟΝ ; ΓΕΛΑΩ [..]; ΓΕΛΑΣ ( SNG Cop. Sicily 269 -70 , 277 , 279 ). Smaller denominations (didrachms and litrai) have as types horseman or head of river-god or Demeter and the legend ΓΕΛΑΣ or ΓΕΛΩΙΩΝ ( SNG Cop. Sicily 271 -75 , 280 -81 ). A gold coinage (dilitron and litra) was issued in C5l, probably to pay the mercenary armies fighting the Carthaginians in 406 / 5 (Diod. 13 . 93 ). The rev . of the gold litra has as type head of the deity Sosipolis, legend: ΣΩΣΙΠΟΛΙΣ ( SNG Cop. Sicily 276 ). Bronze coinage began c. 420 (Jenkins ( 1979 ); SNG Cop. Sicily 282 -87 ). The refoundation of Gela by Timoleon was marked by a new issue of silver litrai; the obv . type of a warrior sacrificing a ram is variously interpreted as Antiphemos, the oecist of Gela, or as Timoleon himself in the guise of the oecist of New Gela (Jenkins ( 1979 ); SNG Cop. Sicily 288 )."
18,Heloron (Ailoros),Sikelia,36.5,15.05,954,4919,"18 . Heloron (Ailoros) Map 47 . Lat. 36 . 50 , long. 15 . 05 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: α . The toponym is /asperacuteΕλωρον , τό (Ps.Skylax 13 ) or /asperacuteΕλωρος ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 100 ( 230 -210 ); Steph.Byz. 270 . 3 ). The city-ethnic is Αιλῶρος (Diod. 23 . 4 . 1 ) or ' Ελωρίτης ( Etym. Magn . 333 . 3 ). Heloron is explicitly called a polis ( πόλις /asperacuteΕλωρον ) in the urban sense in Ps.-Skylax 13 , where this phrase is found under the general heading οικουtildeσι δεgrave καιgrave /asperacuteΕλληνες (which is opposed to ουaspertildeτοι µ εgraveν βάρβαροι ), but apart from that there is no evidence for its status in the Archaic and Classical periods. The evidence for Heloron as a polis in the political sense is C3 : like Akrai (no. 10 ), the city is listed in the treaty between Syracuse and Rome of 263 as a polis assigned to Hieron II (Diod. 23 . 4 . 1 = Staatsverträge no. 479 ); this may suggest dependence on Syracuse (no. 47 ) at an earlier date ( infra ). In assessing the polis status of Heloron, the fact that it is listed in the Delphic list of theorodokoi ( 230 -210 ) ( BCH ( 1921 ) iv . 100 ; cf. Manganaro ( 1964 a ) 420 ) may have some retrospective value.According to Ael. NA 12 . 30 , Heloron was once a Συρακοσίων φρουacuteριον . There are no written sources for the foundation of Heloron, and there are no coins.Heloron is here defined as a polis type A on the basis of Ps.-Skylax 13 , but its polis status is uncertain given the proximity of Syracuse; it cannot be excluded that Heloron was an early military outpost in the southern dominion of Syracuse, though it may have been a dependent polis founded as a fortress (as has been suggested for Kasmenai by Hansen ( 1997 a ) 36 ; cf. Akrai (no. 10 ) and Kasmenai (no. 29 )). To the west, Heloron's territory bordered upon the territory of Kamarina (no. 28 ). Heloron was founded on a coastal plateau about 18 km south of Syracuse and c. 400 m to the north of the river Tellaro ( = ancient Heloros); (morphology of the site: Voza ( 1978 ) pl. 37 , 1 ; plan of site: Voza ( 1980 -81 ) pl. 130 ). Archaeological evidence points to a foundation in C8l-C7e (Voza ( 1973 a) 117 no. 381 ; ( 1978 )); so Syracuse secured its interests southwards before founding the secondary colonies of Akrai, Kasmenai and Kamarina (Di Vita ( 1956 )). An abundance of Greek C7 -C6m material is known from the site, whereas limited C5material suggests that this was a period of recession. The city prospered during the period of Timoleon, and above all in the Heltic period. The C6 circuit wall was built in a pseudo-isodomic technique as a double curtain-wall with internal fill ( emplekton ), in all 2 . 80 m wide (Orsi et al . ( 1966 ) 310 -12 ). A local limestone was used, as well as odd material, such as a C6 tombstone ( IGDS no. 98 ). The Archaic circuit wall was incorporated in the C4fortification when the wall was strengthened and towers were added (Orsi et al . ( 1966 ) 220 -31 ). The C4 circuit wall is known on the north, west and south of the town, its course following the edge of the habitation plateau; the eastern side facing the sea also seems to have been fortified. The habitation area comprised about 9 ha. The 1 , 500 seating capacity of the C4 -C2 theatre ( infra ) gives some indication of population size in the late Classical period. The main routes across the plateau were not laid out in straight lines but in accordance with the uneven terrainuncommon in Western Greek urban planning (Voza ( 1980 -81 ) 686 -87 ). Though this road system is known primarily from its Heltic phase, there is little doubt that its origin is Archaic. An open space bordered by public buildings on the highest point of the plateau is interpreted as an agora (Voza in Storia della Sicilia i. 550 , fig. 90 ). The main urban area in the south-western part of the city was on a grid plan and delimited on the north by a C4m(?) temenos (the so-called Asklepieion) of unknown cult (Orsi et al . ( 1966 ) 287 -88 , 320 ). Sparse remains of habitation structures in the southernmost part of the area are of C8l-C7e date and reveal affinities with contemporary architecture from Megara (no. 36 ) and Syracuse (no. 47 ; Voza ( 1978 ), ( 1980 -81 ) 685 -86 ). Y et another temenos marked the southern limit of the city: a C4s temple dedicated to Demeter (Voza ( 1973 a ) 118 -19 ; Hinz ( 1998 ) 116 -18 ) and smaller thesauroi/naiskoi . A suburban Demeter sanctuary spanning the Archaic and the Heltic periods was located near the coast north of Heloron (Voza ( 1973 a ) 123 -26 ; Storia della Sicilia i. 548 ; Hinz ( 1998 ) 111 -16 ). The Heltic programme of public building included a small C4 -C2 theatre outside the southern perimeter of the city (Orsi et al . ( 1966 ) 232 -35 , 324 -27 ; Mitens ( 1988 ) 89 -91 ). Hesychius refers to an ' Ελώριος αγών (s.v.) celebrated at the river Heloros and possibly to be connected with the city."
19,Henna (Hennaios),Sikelia,37.35,14.15,779,3805,"19 . Henna (Hennaios) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 14 . 15 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: β . The toponym is /acuteΕννα , ηasper (Diod. 14 . 14 . 6 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ενναῖος on C5m coins ( infra ); ' Ενναῖος is found in SEG 301123 . 8 (C4l-C3m;cf. SEG 32 914 ) and Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 5 and Diod. 14 . 14 . 7 (r 403 ). Henna is called a polis in the urban sense in SEG 30 1123 . 13 (C4l-C3m; cf. SEG 32 914 ) and Diod. 14 . 14 . 7 -8 (r 403 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C5m coins ( infra ); the external collective use of the city-ethnic is attested in Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 5 (rC6m) and in SEG 30 1123 . 8 (C4l-C3m; cf. SEG 32 914 ) and Diod. 14 . 14 . 7 (r 403 ), and the external individual use in Diod. 14 . 4 . 6 (r 403 ). A C6m alliance with Syracuse is attested by Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 5 . In 403 , the city experienced a brief tyranny under Aeimnestos, a citizen of Henna itself who acted at Dionysios I's instigation; shortly after his rise to power,however,Dionysios fomented a stasis during which he broke into the city and deposed Aeimnestos (Diod. 14 . 14 . 6 -8 ). In C4l-C3m Henna gave assistance to the people of Entella, who had been driven from their city and were received by the Hennans καιgrave πόλι καιgrave χώραι ( SEG 30 1123 . 8 -13 ; cf. SEG 32 914 ). The grateful Entellans after their return granted isopoliteia to the people of Enna ( SEG 30 1123 . 16 (C4l-C3m); cf. SEG 32 914 ). According to Steph. Byz. 271 . 4 , Henna was a foundation by Syracuse (no. 47 ; κτίσ µ α Συρακοσίων ) established in 664 . While this may be evidence that a Greek identity was claimed for the city, the historicity of the report is doubtful, as is the suggestion that it derives from Philistos of Syracuse ( FGrHist 556 , fr. 5 ; Manni ( 1981 ) 169 ). All evidence points to a Sikulan site strongly Heled: the archaeological evidence attests to some degree of Helation already from C6e ( pace Vallet ( 1962 ) 42 ), and the degree of Helation is significant from C5m, when Greek-style coinage is introduced and the cemeteries bear a strong Greek stamp (Fiorentini ( 1980 -81 ) 599 ); cf. also the reference to an agora at Diod. 14 . 14 . 7 (r 403 ); late sources refer to a theatre (Polyaen. 8 . 21 (r 214 ); Frontin. Str . 4 . 7 . 22 ). Traces of the circuit wall of the acropolis (cf. Polyaen. 8 . 21 ) are known; the published drawings suggest a Heltic date (Orsi ( 1931 ) 384 -88 ; Fiorentini ( 1980 -81 ) 599 ; Martorana ( 1982 -83 ); Bejor and Marotta D'Agata ( 1989 )). The cult of Demeter at Enna was famous; the sources for the cult are mainly literary (Diod. 5 . 3 . 1 -3 ; Strabo 6 . 2 . 6 ), whereas the archaeological evidence is tenuous, and the suggested location of the Demeter sanctuary on a rocky spur north of the settlement plateau remains uncertain (Orsi ( 1931 ) 379 ; Hinz ( 1998 ) 121 -24 ), though a C3 inscription referring to Dam[ater] or Dam[atriastan] was found in the vicinity ( IGDS no. 198 ). The strongest evidence of C5m Helation is provided by the minting of silver litrai from perhaps as early as c. 450 : obv . quadriga driven by Demeter holding torch; rev . Demeter sacrificing at altar holding torch, legend: ΗΕΝΝΑΙΟΝ ; a variant issue has obv . head of Demeter; rev . Demeter sacrificing at altar (Gabrici ( 1959 ) 12 -15 ; Jenkins ( 1975 ); Cammarata ( 1987 )). Henna issued bronze coinage in the period of Timoleon: ( 1 ) obv . head of Demeter, legend: ∆ΑΜΑΤ or ∆ΑΜΑΤΗΡ ; rev . torch between ears of corn, or head of ox with filleted horns, legend: ΕΝΝΑ ; ( 2 ) obv . head of Demeter, legend: ∆ΑΜΑΤΗΡ ; rev . goat before torch of Demeter between ears of corn, legend: ΕΝΝΑ ( SNG Cop. Sicily 234 ); see Bejor and Marotta D'Agata ( 1989 ) 191 ; Talbert ( 1974 ) 181 and Cammarata ( 1987 )."
20,Herakleia ( 1 ) (Herakleotes),Sikelia,37.25,13.15,1213,6235,"20 . Herakleia ( 1 ) (Herakleotes) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 25 , long. 13 . 15 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: α . The original name was Minoa ( Μινώη , ηasper (Hdt. 5 . 46 . 2 ), ΜινΩsubiotaώα (Diod. 4 . 79 . 1 )); the new, or additional, name Herakleia ( ' Ηράκλεια , Polyb. 1 . 18 . 2 ) is commonly assumed to have originated with the seizure of the city by the remnants of the expedition of the Spartan Dorieus (Hdt. 5 . 46 . 2 ; RE viii . 437 ). The double name, Herakleia Minoa , is rare (Polyb. 1 . 25 . 9 : ' Ηράκλεια ηasper ΜινΩsubiotaώα ); Herakleia is common (Polyb. 1 . 18 . 2 ; Diod. 19 . 71 . 7 ); but Minoa appears as well (Heracl. Lemb. 59 ; Diod. 16 . 9 . 4 ; Plut. Dio 25 . 11 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ηρακλεώτης (Diod. 20 . 56 . 3 and possibly IG xii . 6 38 (C4l), on which see infra ). Hdt. 5 . 46 . 2 calls it an αποικίη of Selinous (no. 44 ); the oecist(s) and the date of foundation are unknown, but the date must be post-628 (date of Selinous' foundation). It is called a polis only in later sources: in the urban sense at Plut. Dio 25 . 6 (r time of Dion) (cf. πολισ µ άτιον at Plut. Dio 25 . 5 ), and in the political sense at Diod. 16 . 9 . 4 (r 357 ). A description of its constitution was included among the 158 Aristotelian politeiai (Heracl. Lemb. 59 ; Arist. no. 55 ; Gigon, which uses polis in a mythological account of the foundation by Minos of Crete). The external collective use of the city-ethnic is found in Diod. 20 . 56 . 3 (r 307 ). IG xii . 6 38 (C4l) is a decree by Samos (no. 864 ) granting proxeny etc. to / Επινωιdieresisacuteδης Ευδή µ ου ' Ηρακλεώτης and a reasonable case can be made that the honorandus originated from the present Herakleia (Kebric ( 1975 ), ( 1977 ) 3 -4 ; Shipley ( 1987 ) 164 ). There are very few sources for the Archaic and Classical periods. Nothing is known of the political and institutional life apart from the notice of mythic stamp that Minos imposed Cretan laws on the city (Heracl. Lemb. 59 ; cf. Perlman ( 1992 )). Shortly before 500 , Minoa was captured by those Lakedaimonians who, under the leadership of Euryleon, had survived the ill-fated expedition of Dorieus (Hdt. 5 . 46 . 2 ). The city seems to have been defeated by Akragas in C6l or C5e, Lind. Chron. ( FGrHist 532 ) fr. 30 = Xenagoras ( FGrHist 240 ) fr. 17 recording a dedication at Lindos by Akragas of a palladion taken εκ Μινώιας . Though the date of this episode is uncertain, it is most often seen as the aftermath of the occupation of western Sicily by Euryleon and the Spartans (Luraghi ( 1994 ) 41 , 233 -34 ). During Theron's reign ( 488 -473 ) Herakleia seems to have been a city within the dominion of Akragas (no. 9 ), possibly after its conquest by Theron (cf. Diod. 4 . 79 . 4 with Fontana ( 1978 )). After the fall of the Deinomenids, the city seems to have been involved in the fighting between the disenfranchised mercenaries, who occupied the city, and the Syracusans, who with the Akragantines eliminated the mercenaries (see FGrHist 577 fr. 1 ). The city must have come into Carthaginian hands by the treaty of 383 between Carthage and Dionysios I (Diod. 15 . 17 . 5 ); when Dion sought refuge in Herakleia in 357 , the city was still under Carthaginian dominion (Plut. Dio 25 . 5 ; Diod. 16 . 9 . 4 ), ruled by an άρχων (Plut.) or an επιστάτης (Diod.),but it is described as in Akragantine territory (Diod.). By the treaty of 339 it reverted to the Greek area (Diod. 16 . 82 . 3 ) and was refounded by Timoleon (Talbert ( 1974 ) 159 -60 ). In 314 it became Carthaginian once again (Diod. 19 . 71 . 7 ). Herakleia was founded by Selinous (Hdt. 5 . 46 . 2 ), and the colony may have served to secure the eastern border of Selinous' territory which was threatened by Akragantine expansion during the reign of Phalaris (De Miro ( 1962 ) 144 -46 ). The foundation date is uncertain, but the perspective of a powerful Selinous securing its eastern border towards Akragas as well as archaeological evidence ( infra ) suggest a C6m date.However,the city was presumably within the Akragantine dominion already by C6l and at least from C5e ( supra ); Akragas was located only 25 km to the east. The size and exploitation of the chora of Herakleia is little known. An area of c. 6 km ² has been surveyed, and a C6farmstead or workshop found c. 350 m north of the city (Wilson and Leonard ( 1980 )). The city was founded on a low coastal promontory (modern Capo Bianco) on the estuary of the river Halykos (modern Platani). On the north side the plateau slopes gently down to the Halykos valley, on the south side erosion has produced vertical cliffs, and part of the habitation area of the Greek city may have been destroyed. A 6 kmlong stretch of the circuit wall is preserved on the northeast and west sides facing the river valley and the hinterland; it is unknown whether the cliff facing the sea was fortified. The C5 wall was strengthened, with square towers built in small blocks of sandstone, but superseded by a C4l gypsum ashlar wall with an upper structure of sun-dried brick (Tusa and De Miro ( 1983 ) 177 -78 ; De Miro ( 1994 ) 480 dates the earliest phase of the circuit wall to C6 ). At the time of Timoleon's refoundation a new defensive wall was erected within the earlier city, reducing its size by a half (De Miro ( 1958 a )). There is evidence of C6s occupation, but the early history of the site has not been fully investigated, and the size of the area occupied by the early city is still unknown.(The city did occupy the area of the later Heltic town, but probably also, at least in part, the western plateau within the first phase circuit wall-in all c. 60 -70 ha). The Timoleontic refoundation was laid out as an orthogonally planned city, with east-west-oriented stenopoi , north-south-oriented plateiai , and the single insulae c. 32 m wide, like other Timoleontic refoundations (De Miro ( 1958 b ), ( 1980 ) 716 -21 ). The urban facilities included a C4l theatre (De Miro ( 1955 )). The Archaic cemetery with fairly numerous tombs from the period 550 -500 is located just outside the circuit wall north-east of the city. The cemetery was bisected by a road, and there are indications of social differentiation (De Miro ( 1965 ) 10 -11 ; Wilson ( 1996 ) 92 )."
21,Herakleia ( 2 ),Sikelia,,,394,1941,"21 . Herakleia ( 2 ) Map 47 . Unlocated site in western Sicily, in the region of Eryx. Type: C: α . The toponym is ' Ηρακλείη , ηasper (Hdt. 5 . 43 ) and ' Ηράκλεια , ηasper (Diod. 4 . 23 . 3 ). A city-ethnic is not attested. Following the advice of Antichares of Eleon and the affirmation of the Delphic oracle that he would succeed,Dorieus of Sparta, who was of royal and so Heraklid descent, set out to found a colony in the region of Eryx (Hdt. 5 . 43 ), which, according to Antichares, belonged to the descendants of Herakles (Hdt. 5 . 43 ; cf. Paus. 3 . 16 . 5 ). However, Dorieus' expeditionary force was severely defeated by an alliance of Phoenicians and Egestans (Hdt. 5 . 46 . 1 ; cf. Diod. 4 . 23 . 3 and Paus. 3 . 16 . 5 ). In the aftermath of the disaster Euryleon, the sole survivor of the synktistai , and the remnants of the expedition captured Herakleia Minoa (no. 20 ) and ousted the tyrant Peithagoras of Selinous (Hdt. 4 . 46 . 2 ). Referring to the death of Dorieus as a thing of the past, Herodotos dates the defeat of the expedition prior to c. 481 / 80 ( 7 . 158 ), or to 491 / 90 as argued by some scholars (Merante ( 1970 a )); the beginning of the expedition is connected with the destruction of Sybaris (no. 70 ) by Kroton (no. 56 ) in c. 510 (Hdt. 5 . 45 ; cf. Merante ( 1970 a ), ( 1970 b ) 131 -33 , who argues for an earlier chronology). According to Diod. 4 . 23 . 3 , Dorieus did in fact succeed in taking back the land of the Herakleidai, and founded a polis named Herakleia ( έκτισε πόλιν ' Ηράκλειαν ) which prospered for a period before being razed to the ground by the Carthaginians.Thus,it cannot be ruled out that a Spartan settlement did exist for a period and was then destroyed by the Phoenicians (cf. Bérard ( 1957 ) 260 -66 ; Stauffenberg ( 1960 ) esp. 189 -98 ; De Vido ( 1989 ) with further refs.; Asheri ( 1988 ) for an analysis of the relationship between Greeks, Phoenicians and Elymians)."

The toponym is ' Ερβήσσος , οasper (Diod. 20 . 31 . 5 ; Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 9 = Steph.Byz. 275 . 6 ); or ' Ερβήσος (Polyb. 1 . 18 . 5 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ερβησσῖνος (Diod. 14 . 7 . 6 (r 404 ); C4s coins, infra ). Herbessos is called a polis in the urban sense at Diod. 14 . 7 . 6 (r 404 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4s coins ( infra ); the external collective use is found at Diod. 14 . 7 . 6 (r 404 ) and 14 . 78 . 7 (r 396 ). The latter passage records a peace treaty between Herbessos and Dionysios I. Herbessos is described as a Sikel community at Diod. 14 . 7 . 6 (r 404 ) and 78 . 7 (r 396 ), but is included here on account of its C4s Greek-style coinage ( infra ). In addition,Greek C6e epigraphic material from Montagna di Marzo, the presumed site of Herbessos, includes votives to Herakles (cf. IGDS 166 -68 ). The location of the city is unknown, though it is possibly to be located at Montagna di Marzo (Bejor ( 1989 b ) 280 ); Diod. 14 . 7 . 6 (r 404 ) suggests that it was fortified by C5l. The urban remains from this site are of C6m Sikel walls with C4 reinforcements in ashlar masonry, from the Greek period. There are some traces of urban planning, but whether these are Douketian or Timoleontic is uncertain. However, the majority of the urban remains, as well as the cemeteries, are Heltic (Cutroni Tusa and Moreschini ( 1992 )). Herbessos struck bronze coins from c. 325 , or a little earlier: obv . female head (Sikelia?), legend: ΕΡΒΗΣΣΙΝΩΝ ; rev . forepart of man-headed bull (Head, HN ² 143 ; SNG Cop. Sicily 292 ; a Timoleontic coinage: Talbert ( 1974 ) 181 ; Karlsson ( 1995 ) 165 n. 3 (F); Bejor ( 1989 b ) 279 with further refs.)."

The toponym is /asperacuteΕρβιτα , ηasper (Ephor.fr. 91 = Steph.Byz. 275 . 8 ; Diod. 14 . 16 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ερβιταῖος (C4s coins, infra ; Diod. 14 . 15 . 1 ). Herbita is called a polis in the urban sense at Diod. 14 . 15 . 1 and 16 . 1 (r 403 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4s coins ( infra ), and the external collective use in Diod. 12 . 8 . 2 (r 446 ), 14 . 15 . 1 (r 403 ), 14 . 78 . 7 (r 396 ) (cf.

Thuc. 7 . 1 . 4 , quoted infra ), and Archonides II as επιστάτης at Diod. 14 . 16 . 1 . However, at Diod. 14 . 16 . 1 a peace treaty with Dionysios I is said to have been concluded by οasper δηtilde µ ος οasper τῶν ' Ερβιταίων , and at 14 . 78 . 7 agreements are described as concluded between Dionysios and τουgraveς ' Ερβιταίους . (See also below on colonisation.) IG ii² 32 ( 385 / 4 ) is probably a grant of proxeny by Athens (no. 361 ) to Archonides II, his brother Demon, and their descendants.A C4l-C3m symmachia between Herbita and Entella is attested in SEG 30 1117 . 15 . Recently, Greek-style silver and bronze coins of Herbita have come to light; they date from the period of Timoleon ( c. 350 -325 ), and were found in the region of Gangi. Silver (probably litrai): obv . head of Apollo, legend: ΗΕΡΒΙΤΑΙ ; Rev . Apollo seated on Ionic capital. The smaller bronze denominations carry on obv . female head, legend: ΗΕΡΒΙΤΑΙΩΝ ; rev . standing youth with spear (C. Boehringer ( 1981 ); Bejor ( 1989 c ) 284 ). Herbita was involved in colonisation on two occasions: in 446 , when Archonides I collaborated with Douketios in the foundation of Kale Akte (Diod. 12 . 8 . 2 ), and in 403 , when Archonides II founded the city of Alaisa (no. 11 ), a foundation which eclipsed its mother city to the degree that its inhabitants denied their origin (Diod. 14 . 16 . 2 -4 ; see Cataldi ( 1982 ); cf. supra 190 ). According to Diod. 14 . 16 . 2 , Alaisa was founded by Archonides II in order to house veteran mercenaries, a symmikton ochlon that the war against Dionysios had driven into the city, as well as poor citizens of Herbita itself; the latter are said to have actively encouraged his plans. In a passage referring to 446 , Diod. 12 . 8 . 2 describes Herbita, or at least its ruler Archonides I, as Sikel; and the city may be described as Sikel again at Diod. 14 . 78 . 7 (r 396 ). The Greek name Archonides of two of its rulers may indicate a pretension to Greek identity (C. Boehringer ( 1981 ) 95 ); but Thuc. 7 . 1 . 4 describes Archonides I as τῶν . . . Σικελῶν βασιλευacuteων τινῶν . By C4s, however, the city issued Greekstyle coins ( supra )."
24,Himera (Himeraios),Sikelia,37.55,13.5,2784,14198,"24 . Himera (Himeraios) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 55 , long. 13 . 50 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A: α . The toponym is ' Ι µ έρη , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 165 . 1 ) or ' Ι µ έρα (Thuc. 6 . 62 . 2 ; SEG 11 1223 a (C5f)). The city-ethnic is ' Ι µ εραῖος (C6l coins, infra ; Thuc. 7 . 1 . 3 ). Himera is repeatedly described as a Hellenic polis (Thuc. 6 . 62 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 37 ; Ps.-Skylax 13 ); it is called a polis both in the territorial sense (Thuc. 6 . 62 . 2 ) and in the urban sense (Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 37 ; Ps.-Skylax 13 ), and in the urban and political senses combined (Aen. Tact. 10 . 22 ). The political sense is found in Diod. 11 . 48 . 6 (r 476 ). Paus. 6 . 4 . 11 uses πολιτεία in a reference to C5e, and the politeia was included in the Aristotelian collection of constitutions (fr. 515 . 1 ). Thuc. 6 . 5 . 1 calls Himera an αποικία , and it is described as the patra of the C6 poet Stesichoros (Test. A 26 , Davies); cf. SEG 29 414 . 4 ( c. 450 ) where [ πάτραι ] is a possible restoration (cf. CEG I 393 for other restorations). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C6l coins ( infra ). The external collective use of the city-ethnic is attested by SEG 30 1079 (C6m) and Thuc. 7 . 1 . 3 , 58 . 2 . Individually, the ethnic is often applied to Stesichoros (e.g. Pl. Phdr . 244 A; IG xii . 5 444 . 73 . 85 b (C3f)); see also AM 87 ( 1972 ) 114 -15 no. 6 for a possible Archaic instance of the external individual use. The use is also attested in Pl. Prt . 335 E. Himera was founded by Zankle (no. 51 ) and exiles from Syracuse (no. 47 ) called οιasper Μυλητίδαι (Thuc. 6 . 5 . 1 ; but Strabo 6 . 2 . 6 says: οιasper εν Μυλαῖς έκτισαν Ζαγκλαῖοι ). The oecists were Eukleides, Simos and Sakon (Thuc. 6 . 5 . 1 ; cf. IGDS no. 165 ). The year of foundation, 648 , is inferred from the notice that the city was inhabited for 240 years before its destruction in 409 (Diod. 13 . 62 . 4 ). The continued ties with Zankle are revealed by Skythes, ruler of Zankle, who c. 493 went to Himera as an exile (Hdt. 6 . 24 ), and if the text on a bronze plaque found at Himera is correctly reconstructed by Brugnone ( 1997 ) 271 -74 as φυ ] λαgrave ∆ανκλαῖα , this may be taken as evidence of an 'ethnic' phyle of Zanklaian colonisers at Himera. But the ethnic composition of the city was mixed, the colonisers being mostly Chalkidian, i.e. Ionians, but some Syracusans,i.e.Dorians;and while the local dialect was a corresponding mixture, Chalkidian νό µ ι µ α prevailed (Thuc. 6 . 5 . 1 ). The territory was called ηasper ' Ι µ εραία ( χώρα ) (Thuc. 3 . 115 . 1 ; Diod. 13 . 61 . 4 (r 409 )). The C5 immediate hinterland with a number of rural settlements, delimited by border fortresses, encompassed c. 50 km ² (Belvedere ( 1988 ) 196 -206 , ( 2000 )). The territory of Himera stretched over a vast area, estimated at c. 700 km ² , divided to the south from the territories of Gela (no. 17 ) and Akragas (no. 9 ) by the Monte Cassero hills, and in the west at the river Thermos from the territory of the Phoenician city of Soloeis. However, within the territory of Himera were scattered indigenous settlements, and the dividing line between the dominions of Himera, Gela and Akragas is not always clear (Vassallo ( 1996 )). SEG 30 1079 (C6m) seems to attest to fighting between Himera and Sikanoi (cf. Thuc. 3 . 115 . 2 ). For the Archaic and Classical settlement pattern of the Himeraian territory, see Belvedere ( 1988 ) 196 -206 . According to Diod. 13 . 62 . 4 , c. 3 , 000 andres were captured during the destruction in 409 , but it seems impossible to convert this number into a population estimate (cf. the few army figures below). The C5e population has been calculated at 20 , 000 , including a rural population of 10 , 000 , by Asheri ( 1973 ), but this figure is probably on the low side, if one takes into account that the size of the urban centre of Himera is now calculated to be c. 80 ha (Allegro and Vassallo ( 1992 ) 147 -48 ). Himera was pillaged and destroyed by the Carthaginians in 409 ; 3 , 000 surviving men were put to death ( κατέσφαξεν ), women and children were distributed to the victorious enemy and presumably enslaved (Diod. 13 . 59 . 4 -62 . 5 ), and the site was abandoned (Diod. 11 . 49 . 4 ; Strabo 6 . 2 . 6 ), though there is some archaeological and numismatic evidence for re-occupation from c. 405 until the defeat of Dionysios I at Kronion in 383 / 2 , when Himera became part of Carthaginian territory for good (Diod. 15 . 16 . 3 ). Later references to Himera must therefore be to the survivors who were settled at Thermai, on the border of Greek and Phoenician spheres of interest (Cic. Verr . 2 . 2 . 86 ; cf. Diod. 14 . 47 . 6 , 56 . 2 ). According to Arist. Rh . 1393 b 10 -22 , Phalaris, the tyrant of Akragas c. 570 -554 , was elected strategos autokrator by the Himeraians, but the historicity of the report is doubtful (Berve ( 1967 ) 130 ). By C5e, however, the city was certainly ruled by tyrants. The earliest attested tyrant is T erillos ( τυacuteραννος , Hdt. 7 . 165 ) who, expelled by Theron of Akragas, attempted to return as an ally of the Carthaginians, seeking help also from Anaxilaos of Rhegion (Hdt. 7 . 165 ). The ensuing battle at Himera in 480 led to the victory of Theron and Gelon (Diod. 11 . 20 . 3 ff.; cf. Zahrnt ( 1993 )). Theron conceded the tyranny of Himera to his son Thrasydaios (Diod. 11 . 48 . 6 ). The Himeraians rebelled against the tyranny of Thrasydaios; Theron, having curbed the insurrection, repopulated Himera with Doric and 'other' colonists to whom he granted citizenship (Diod. 11 . 48 . 6 -49 . 4 ). Not until 460 were those who escaped the intervention of Theron able to return to Himera (Diod. 11 . 76 . 4 ). During the Peloponnesian War,Himera remained loyal to Syracuse (no. 47 ) by not admitting the Athenian fleet in 415 (Thuc. 6 . 62 . 2 ) and by entering into an alliance with Gylippos against the Athenians in 414 (Thuc. 7 . 1 . 4 ; Diod. 13 . 7 . 7 ). One thousand hoplites/light-armed troops, and 100 cavalry joined Gylippos on his march to Syracuse (Thuc. 7 . 1 . 5 ). A bronze plaque attests to the existence of φρατρίαι at Himera (Brugnone ( 1997 ) 274 -79 ) and may also attest to a system of phylai (Brugnone ( 1997 ) 271 -74 ). At least three Himeraian athletes won Panhellenic victories: Ischyros at Olympia in 516 ( Olympionikai 137 ) and Krison thrice at Olympia in C5m ( Olympionikai 294 , 306 , 312 ). Particularly interesting is Ergoteles, who won no fewer than eight Panhellenic victories (two at Olympia ( Olympionikai 224 , 251 ) and two each at Delphi, Nemea and Isthmia).A Cretan by birth, he was a naturalised Himeraian and competed as such (Paus. 6 . 4 . 11 ; cf. Pind. Ol . 12 and SEG 11 1123 a celebrating Olympic success; Phlegon ( FGrHist 415 ) fr. 1 . 13 ). Himera was founded on a north-south-oriented oblong hill between the river Torto to the west and the river Himera to the east, commanding the lower Himera valley. The city occupied also the coastal plain below, though whether this comprised a harbour settlement near the estuary is as yet uncertain (Bonacasa ( 1976 ) 5 -14 for a general description of the site). A stretch of a presumably Archaic (no precise date) stone and earth rampart is known from the southern edge of the plateau, with a semicircular projection in the south-east corner and a small stretch running northwards defending the east side of the plateau (Bonacasa Carra ( 1974 ) 110 -11 ; Bonacasa ( 1980 -81 ) 855 , pl. 117 , fig. 2 ), revealing that habitation covered all of the plateau at least from the Archaic period. A wall of sun-dried bricks along the outer edge of the plateau on the northern side of the sanctuary is with some uncertainty dated to C5e and connected with the Carthaginian conflict of 480 . Dividing the upper city from the city on the plain below, the wall may have functioned as a diateichisma (Allegro ( 1991 ) 71 ). The walls are mentioned by Diod. 13 . 59 . 7 -9 in reference to the siege in 409 . The upper city occupied about 32 ha,the lower city about 50 ha (Allegro and Vassallo ( 1992 ) 145 -47 ). Corresponding to the traditional date of foundation ( 648 ), there is sporadic evidence of a C7m settlement on the coastal plain below the upper plateau near the estuary of the river Himera. The more substantial urban remains on the plateau of Himera are from C7s, suggesting a gradual urban development from plain to plateau (Vassallo ( 1997 ) 85 -90 ). Two Archaic urban phases are known. Already the earlier (C7l-C6e) shows features of planning, but it was soon replaced by a new overall urban layout, probably as a result of destructions of the early city and a refoundation c. 580 -570 (Allegro ( 1997 )). Although the Archaic town plan is impressive in its size and regularity, the remains suggest that even in this second period habitation was concentrated in certain areas: the northern area (near the sanctuary) and the southern area (near the main route to the chora ). Recent investigations have given indications of a 6 . 20 m-wide north-south-oriented plateia uniting the main parts of the plateau (Allegro ( 1988 -89 ) 656 ). Theron's repopulation of Himera in 476 ( supra ) resulted in further developments and reorganisation of the city,indicated by changes in the layout of single insulae (Belvedere ( 1976 ) 580 -82 ; Allegro ( 1988 -89 ) 657 ). A redistribution of land may be inferred from C5e epigraphic evidence (Brugnone ( 1997 )). The lower city had an urban plan from C7s, with later changes which correspond to the phases of the city outlined above (Allegro and Vassallo ( 1992 )). Recently a C5f suburban quarter east of the city has been revealed between the right bank of the river and the Archaic cemetery (ibid. 139 n. 40 ; cf. Diod. 13 . 75 . 2 (r 408 )). The cemetery with tombs from the early history of Himera until c. 525 is located near the coast east of the Himera valley (Vassallo ( 1991 ), ( 1993 -94 )). From C6l and for all of C5 two new cemeteries were in use south of the city and on the plateau west of the city (Di Stefano ( 1970 ) 319 -21 ; ( 1976 )); tomb material (amphoras) reveals a wide commercial network (Vassallo et al . ( 1991 )). The north-eastern corner of the plateau is occupied by a sanctuary with remains of four C7s-C5e temples (Bonacasa ( 1970 ); Allegro ( 1991 )), probably dedicated to Athena, like the city itself and its chora (Diod. 5 . 3 . 4 ). A sanctuary of Demeter with at least two C6 -C5 naiskoi was located in the north-western quarter of the upper city ( Himera ii . 194 -205 ; Hinz ( 1998 ) 166 -67 ). A monumental stone temple,'Temple of Victory' , again presumably dedicated to Athena (Bonacasa ( 1980 ) 269 ), was built in the lower city in C5e (P . Marconi ( 1931 ); T. Van Compernolle ( 1989 ) 48 -51 , ( 1992 ) 55 -58 ), probably to commemorate the victory over Carthage in 480 (cf. Diod. 11 . 25 . 1 ) or built by Theron in connection with his resettlement of the colony in 476 (cf. P . Marconi ( 1931 ) 127 for an earlier Archaic phase). Attested cults include, in addition to that of Athena (Diod. 5 . 3 . 4 ), those of Zeus Soter (C5l: Manni Piraino ( 1974 ) 267 -69 ); Herakles (Diod. 5 . 3 . 4 ; Bonacasa ( 1991 )); the nymph Himera (coins; cf. Cic. Verr . 2 . 2 . 87 ); Tyche Soteira and Zeus Eleutherios (Pind. Ol . 12 . 1 -3 ). Himera began minting drachms on the EuboianChalkidian standard c. 550 -540 : obv . cock; rev . incuse square with sunk and raised triangles within a square incuse field ( SNG Cop. Sicily 294 -96 , 297 (obol)). Later issues have rev . hen in a square incuse field, and there are several variations of the basic type ( SNG Cop. Sicily 298 -301 ). An early issue has obv . legend ΗΙΜΕΡΑΙΟΝ , abbreviated on later issues to ΗΙ , ΗΙΜΕ ( SNG Cop. Sicily 301 ). Other coin legends are names of mint officials,in full or abbreviated: ΛΥ , ΤΥ , ΤΥΧΟΝ , ΣΟΓ [ ΕΝΕΣ ]. Lower denominations carry related types (Kraay ( 1984 ); C. Boehringer ( 1984 -85 ) 105 -8 ; Molinari ( 1986 )). The first series ends c. 484 / 3 with the expulsion of Terillos; Akragantine control at Himera c. 483 -470 is reflected in an issue of didrachms on the Attic standard: obv . cock, some with legend ΗΙΜΕΡΑ ; rev . crab (Jenkins ( 1971 ); SNG Cop. Sicily 302 -3 , 304 (drachm)). During the subsequent period of Syracusan influence a new coinage was introduced with the principal denomination based upon the Syracusan tetradrachm: obv . quadriga, crowned by Nike; rev . nymph Himera pours a libation at an altar, at her side a Silenos bathes in a fountain with a spout in the form of a lion's head ( SNG Cop.Sicily 306 ). A variant has on the obv . biga, legend: ΠΕΛΟΠΣ ; rev . figure of nymph named ΗΙΜΕΡΑ (Kraay ( 1976 ) 215 , pl. 765 ). This issue may celebrate the victory of Ergoteles at Olympia in 472 or 464 , and according to Biucchi ( 1988 ) the series may commence as late as 464 . A late tetradrachm known from one issue only has obv . quadriga galloping, above flying Nike with wreath and tablet with inscription (signature ?); rev . nymph at altar and Silenos bathing under lion-head spout, legend: Η ΜΕΡ ΑΙΟΝ , probably from very shortly before the 409 / 8 disaster (C. Boehringer ( 1989 ) 34 ). Lower denominations are litrai: obv . forepart of winged, man-headed monster; rev . goatrider; hemidrachms: obv . goat-rider, rev . Nike holding a phlaston ( SNG Cop. Sicily 307 -11 ). Bronze coinage was introduced c. 420 (Kraay ( 1979 ); SNG Cop. Sicily 313 -19 ). Coins were minted during the resettlement period c. 405 -383 / 2 : lower bronze denominations with legend ΙΜΕ ; C4 issue of silver litrai: obv . Herakles; rev . palladion, legend: ΙΜΕΡΑΙΟΝ (C. Boehringer ( 1989 )). There is some evidence of coinage during the reign of Timoleon; an issue influenced by the Zeus Eleutherios type, after the battle of Krimissos in 342 / 1 : obv . Kronos, legend: ΚΡΟΝΟΣ ; rev . eagle and thunderbolt, legend: ΙΜΕΡΑΙΩΝ (C. Boehringer ( 1989 ) 36 ). On the evidence of bronze ingots counterstamped with Himeraian mint types, flans, bronze bars and slags, the public mint has been identified with a structure inside the sanctuary in the north-eastern corner of the plateau (Cutroni Tusa ( 1982 a))."
25,Hippana (Hipanatas),Sikelia,37.4,13.25,308,1634,"25 . Hippana (Hipanatas) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 40 , long. 13 . 25 (Monte dei Cavalli). Size of territory: ? Type: C: β . The toponym is ' Ιππάνα , ηasper (Polyb. 1 . 24 . 10 ); Diod. 23 . 9 . 5 has Σιττάνα , ηasper . The city-ethnic is ' Ιπανάτας (C5m coins, infra ). Hippana is called a polis only by later sources such as Polyb. 1 . 24 . 10 (r 258 ), who uses polis in the urban sense; it is included here on account of its Classical Greek-style coinage ( infra ) and a kerykeion inscribed ∆ΑΜΟΣΙΟΝ and ΙΠΑ , restored ' Ιπα [ ναταtildeν ] by Manganaro ( 1997 ). Hippana is commonly identified with the site of Monte dei Cavalli in the territory of Himera, but the evidence for this identification is not conclusive. The urban remains are mainly from a C4m-C3m phase, which is interpreted as a Timoleontic refoundation of the originally indigenous settlement. Strongly built circuit walls in ashlar were raised on an acropolis and around the lower habitation plateau, 30 ha in area. There are some remains of public structures, a shrine and a theatre of Greek type. Aerial photography has revealed formal planning on the lower plateau: Mitens ( 1988 ) 104 ; Michelini ( 1992 ); Vassallo ( 1991 ). Rare C5m silver litrai ( obv . eagle on column, legend: ΙΠΑΝΑΤΑΝ ; rev . dolphin and scallop) have been attributed to Hippana (Head, HN ² 147 ; Manganaro ( 1997 ) 127 n. 6 , 129 ); the types, although ultimately based upon types of Akragas, seem to reflect Carthaginian (Motyan) influence (Manganaro ( 1997 ) 129 ). C4m bronze coins are restruck on Punic coins: obv . bull, legend: ΙΠΑ in exergue; rev . Astragalos(?) (Manganaro ( 1997 ))."
26,Imachara (Imacharaios),Sikelia,,,310,1464,"26 . *Imachara (Imacharaios) Map 47 . Unlocated. Barr . tentatively locates Imachara at modern Vaccarra di Nicosia (lat. 37 . 50 , long. 14 . 20 ); cf. Cataldi ( 1990 ) 243 -44 . The precise location is unknown, however; a C5 kerykeion inscribed ' Ι µ αχαραίων δα µ όσιον ( IG xiv 589 ; LSAG 269 , 276 . 23 , dating it to 475 -450 ; IGDS no. 199 , dating it to C5 ) was found in the region of modern Nissoria, and it may be of relevance that a rich C5 -C4 , mainly Corinthian coin hoard was found in the same area ( IGCH 2133 ; Cataldi ( 1990 ) 244 ). Pelagatti ( 1964 -65 ) 252 suggests a location at Mendolito on the basis of a Sikulan inscription iamakaram (?) found there. Type: C: β . The toponym * ' Ι µ αχάρα is suggested by the city-ethnic ( infra ); Ptol. Geog . 3 . 4 . 7 lists ' Η µ ιχάρα ηgrave ' Ι µ ιχάρα among the poleis mesogeioi tes Sikelias . The city-ethnic is ' Ι µ αχαραῖος ( IGDS no. 199 (C5 ); C4 coins, infra ). No source calls Imachara a polis , but it is included here on account of ( 1 ) its C5 kerykeion ( supra ; for a full discussion of this type of evidence from Sicily, see Manganaro ( 1996 c ) 141 -44 ; ( 1997 )), and ( 2 ) its C4 coins. Both of these attest the internal collective use of the cityethnic, indicate a high degree of Helation, and suggest polis status. The mint of Imachara is known from two specimens only, both silver litrai: obv . head of Hera, legend: ΙΜΑΧΑΡΑΙΩΝ ; rev . butting bull (Jenkins ( 1975 ) 90 -92 )."
27,Kallipolis (Kallipolites),Sikelia,,,382,2001,"27 . Kallipolis (Kallipolites) Map 47 . Unlocated. Type: A: α . The toponym is Καλλίπολις (Strabo 6 . 2 . 6 ). The city-ethnic is Καλλιπολίτης (Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 ). Kallipolis is implicitly called a polis in both the urban and the political senses by Herodotos: at 7 . 154 . 2 he mentions Hippokrates' aggression against a number of communities, including Kallipolis; he then goes on to state that, Syracuse excepted, none of the poleis mentioned escaped being enslaved by Hippokrates ( ουδε µ ία απέφυγε δουλοσυacuteνην προgraveς ' Ιπποκράτεος ; cf. Hansen ( 2000 ) 205 ). So Kallipolis was a polis which Hippokrates c. 495 turned into one of his dependencies (Dunbabin ( 1948 ) 380 -82 , 402 ; Vallet ( 1978 ) 119 -20 ). It is described as an apoikia by Ps.-Skymnos 286 (cf. κτίζειν in Strabo 6 . 2 . 6 ). The external collective use of the city-ethnic is found in Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 . Only two events are known from the history of Kallipolis: its foundation and its 'enslavement' by Hippokrates ( supra ). It was founded by Naxos (no. 41 ; Strabo 6 . 2 . 6 ). The date of the foundation is unknown, but Ps.-Skymnos 286 mentions it alongside Naxos' other foundations (Leontinoi (no. 33 ), Zankle (no. 51 ) and Katane (no. 30 )), and this may suggest that it was founded contemporaneously with them (i.e. C8l; M. Miller ( 1970 ) 35 , 86 ). In Strabo's day it was deserted ( 6 . 2 . 6 ). Various sites have been brought forward as candidates for the site of Kallipolis, but it remains unidentified (Camassa ( 1989 b )), though recent finds at San Marco south of Naxos are promising in this connection (Pelagatti ( 1981 ) 295 n. 5 ). In general, the fact that, like Katane and Leontinoi, it was a colony of Naxos suggests a location in the coastal plain south of Naxos or on the slopes of Mt. Etna; in any case, the foundation of Kallipolis should be seen as a part of the Chalkidian occupation of north-eastern Sicily. The siege mentioned by Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 implies that Kallipolis was fortified by C5e."
28,Kamarina (Kamarinaios),Sikelia,36.5,14.25,3084,16078,"28 . Kamarina (Kamarinaios) Map 47 . Lat. 36 . 50 , long. 14 . 25 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Κα µ άρινα , -ης , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 154 . 3 , 156 . 2 ; Thuc. 6 . 75 . 4 ). The city-ethnic is Κα µ αριναῖος ( IvO 266 . 2 ( 480 -475 ); Hdt. 7 . 156 . 2 ). In Ps.-Skylax 13 , Kamarina is listed as the first toponym after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense; polis in the political sense occurs at Pind. Ol . 5 . 4 , 20 and Thuc. 3 . 86 . 2 . Asty is found at Hdt. 7 . 156 . 2 , astos in Pind. Ol . 5 . 14 , and politeuma in Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 22 (r 424 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C5 coins ( infra ); the external collective use is found in Hdt. 7 . 156 . 2 and Thuc. 7 . 58 . 1 . The external individual use is found in Diod. 1 . 68 . 6 (r 528 ) and F.Delphes iii . 3 202 . 4 ( 266 ). A remarkable example is found in IvO 266 . 2 ( 480 -475 ), a dedication at Olympia by a Mantinean who became both a Κα µ αριναῖος and a Συρακόσιος , and so was probably a citizen of Kamarina who in 484 was made a citizen of Syracuse by Gelon (Hansen ( 1996 ) 184 and infra ). The territory of Kamarina (Pelagatti ( 1980 -81 ) pl. 168 ; Di Stefano ( 2000 ) ( chora ), ( 1984 -85 ) 728 , fig. 1 (territory)) is called ηasper γηtilde ηasper Κα µ αριναίων in Thuc. 6 . 5 . 3 and ηasper Κα µ αριναία at Thuc. 6 . 78 . 4 . It functioned as a buffer zone between the Geloan and Syracusan spheres of influence; Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 5 suggests that the river Hyrminios (Irminio) formed the border between Syracuse (no. 47 ) and Kamarina.A number of C6 -C4farmsteads,some with adjacent cemeteries, are known from the lowland plains of the Hypparis (Ippari), the Oanis (Rifriscolaro) and the Hyrminios river valleys. The orientation of farmsteads located in the hinterland coincides with that of the city, and the size of the area allotted to the single farmsteads is divisible by the size of the urban insulae , suggesting an organisation of the agricultural area analogous to that of the C5 city (Di Stefano ( 1993 -94 ) 1378 -81 ; Cordano and Di Stefano ( 1997 ) 297 -99 ). Investigations have also shown that a system of roads joined the city with its cemeteries and the farmsteads located in the further hinterland (Pelagatti ( 1980 -81 ) 723 -29 ; Di Stefano ( 1984 -85 ) 762 -64 ). On the estuary of the river Hyrminios, at Contrada Maistro c. 15 km south-east of Kamarina, a harbour settlement founded contemporaneously with Kamarina may mark the border between the territories of Kamarina and Syracuse. The site, which had a Demeter sanctuary (Cordano ( 1997 )), was abandoned in C6l (Di Stefano ( 1987 b )). T o the north-west the river Achates (Dirillo) formed the border with Geloan territory. An important C5l coin hoard ( IGCH 2095 ) from the C6 -C5 border settlement of Scornavacche (ancient identity unknown) in the Dirillo valley has revealed contacts with the main Greek cities of Sicily. Inland the territory of Kamarina was delimited by the Hyblaian mountains, which constituted the border of the territories of Kasmenai (no. 29 ) and Akrai (no. 10 ), and further northwards of Leontinoi (no. 33 ). The Sikels of the mountainous hinterland were allied with Kamarina during the C6m war with Syracuse (Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 17 ). During the Hippokratean phase ( infra ), Kamarina was apparently forced to break with previous Sikel allies such as the city of Ergetion (Polyaen. 5 -6 ; cf. Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 10 with Sinatra ( 1998 )) of uncertain location in the Hyblaian hills. However, the impression given by the evidence is that of a network of contacts with the Sikel hinterland, as far north as the foothills of the Hyblaian mountains, a vast area with a number of Sikel sites revealing a strong degree of C6 Helation (Di Stefano ( 1987 a ), ( 1988 -89 ) with refs.). The immediate hinterland of Kamarina comprised about 50 -70 km ² , the larger territory (dominion?) about 500 km ² . Kamarina was founded by Syracuse (no. 47 ), 135 years after the foundation of Syracuse itself, i.e. c. 598 (Thuc. 6 . 5 . 3 ); the date is confirmed by the archaeological evidence ( infra ). The oecists were Daskon and Menekolos,the former a Syracusan and the latter probably a Corinthian,as suggested by onomastic evidence (Cordano ( 1987 )). Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 5 (rC6m) refers to treaties of alliance between Kamarina and Sikels, Gela (no. 17 ) and other (presumably Greek) communities in a C6m war with Syracuse. According to Thuc. 6 . 5 . 3 , the Kamarinaians were made anastatoi by Syracuse after a revolt ( απόστασις ); this happened c. 552 -549 (schol. Pind. Ol . 5 . 16 ), probably in connection with the war attested in Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 5 in which both Syracuse and Kamarina were assisted by allies. However,the site was apparently not depopulated: not only is Parmenides of Kamarina attested as victor at Olympia in 528 ( Olympionikai 125 ), but there is no archaeological evidence of a break in habitation (Lentini ( 1983 ) 5 -6 ) or in the use of the Archaic cemetery (Pelagatti ( 1976 -77 ) 523 -26 ; ( 1978 b )); so Kamarina probably continued to exist, possibly as a dependent polis of Syracuse (cf. apostasis in Thuc. 6 . 5 . 3 and the statement by Hdt. 7 . 154 . 3 : Συρηκοσίων δεgrave ηtildeν Κα µ άρινα τοgrave αρχαῖον ). After the defeat of Syracuse by Hippokrates of Gela in the C5e ( 492 ?) battle at Heloros, Kamarina passed, after arbitration by Corinth (no. 227 ) and Korkyra (no. 123 ), from Syracuse to Gela (Hdt. 7 . 154 . 3 ), as payment for the release of Syracusan prisoners of war (Thuc. 6 . 5 . 3 ). Hippokrates, acting as oecist himself, refounded the city c. 490 (Thuc. 6 . 5 . 3 ; Philistos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 15 ; Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 19 ). Casevitz ( 1985 ) 168 , 172 -73 shows that the term used by Thucydides to describe Hippokrates' refoundation ( = κατοικίζω ) mainly designates the settling of new inhabitants and may be used for the 'colonisation' of a site already inhabited. The term used by Philistos and Timaios ( = συνοικίζω ) implies the participation in the new foundation of various unspecified groups (Cordano ( 1992 ) 7 ). In 484 Gelon destroyed Kamarina (Hdt. 7 . 156 . 2 ; Thuc. 6 . 5 . 3 ) and transferred all Kamarinaians to Syracuse, where they received citizenship (Hdt. 7 . 156 . 2 ); prior to that, Gelon had installed Glaukos of Karystos as his governor in Kamarina, and the occasion for his destruction of the city was presumably its execution of Glaukos (schol. Aeschin. 3 . 189 ; Demand ( 1990 ) 47 -48 ). Kamarina now probably ceased to exist until its refoundation by Gela in 461 ; at least, a decrease in the archaeological evidence covering the years 484 -461 suggests that the site was uninhabited or only sparsely inhabited in this period (Giudice ( 1988 ) esp. 56 -57 ). In 461 (Diod. 11 . 76 . 5 ) Kamarina was refounded by Gela (Thuc. 6 . 5 . 3 ). In 427 this third Kamarina was allied with Leontinoi (no. 33 ) and Athens (no. 361 ) against Syracuse (Thuc. 3 . 86 . 2 , 6 . 75 . 3 ). At the Congress of Gela in 424 it was decided that Kamarina was to receive Morgantina (no. 37 ) on condition of the payment of αργυacuteριον τακτόν to Syracuse (Thuc. 4 . 65 . 1 ). This congress had been called on the initiative of Gela (no. 17 ) and Kamarina after they had ended a mutual war by ekecheiria (Thuc. 4 . 58 ; Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 22 ). In 422 Phaiax 'won over'Kamarina to Athens (Thuc. 5 . 4 . 6 ), but the city was allied with Syracuse as well (Thuc. 6 . 88 . 2 ) and eventually sided with her ( infra ). In 405 Kamarina suffered from Carthaginian attacks (Diod. 13 . 108 . 3 ), and Dionysios I forced the inhabitants ( τουgraveς εκεῖ ) to relocate to Syracuse (Diod. 13 . 111 . 3 ); but the Kamarinaians (with the Geloans) left Syracuse for Leontinoi τΩsubiotaῶ ∆ιονυσίΩsubiotaω διαφόρως έχοντες ( 113 . 4 ). The 405 peace treaty between Dionysios and Carthage decreed that Kamarina be ateichistos and pay tribute to Carthage (Diod. 13 . 114 . 1 ). A Timoleontic reinforcement of the population is reported by Diod. 16 . 82 . 7 , and the archaeological evidence points to a revival of the city in C4s (Talbert ( 1974 ) 149 -50 ; Pelagatti ( 1976 )). Kamarinaian military forces assisted Syracuse during the conflict with Athens (Thuc. 6 . 67 . 2 ), although the city initially attempted neutrality,allied as it was to both parties (Thuc. 6 . 88 . 2 ); Thuc. 7 . 33 . 1 mentions contingents of 500 hoplites, 300 akontistai and 300 toxotai ; a contingent of twenty cavalry is mentioned at Thuc. 6 . 67 . 2 . In 406 Kamarinaian forces fought with Gela and Syracuse against the Carthaginians at the battle of the river Himera (Diod. 13 . 86 . 5 ), and Menes of Kamarina was commander on this occasion ( 13 . 87 . 5 ); Kamarinaian forces assisted Dionysios again in 397 (Diod. 14 . 47 . 6 ), and in 357 troops from the city assisted Dion (Diod. 16 . 9 . 5 ; Plut. Dio 27 . 1 ). Reception of envoys is attested at Thuc. 6 . 75 . 3 ; sending of envoys is mentioned in Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 22 (r 424 ). At the refoundation in 461 a system of civic subdivisions was introduced whereby the citizens were organised into phratries (subdivided into triakades (Cordano ( 1992 ); Murray ( 1997 )). Glaukos of Karystos presumably ruled the city as tyrant on behalf of Gelon (Berve ( 1967 ) 142 ). Apart from that, the form of constitution is unknown,though there are glimpses of its working: a death sentence passed by the assembly is recorded in reference to c. 484 by schol. Aeschin. 3 . 189 , and a meeting of the assembly ( ξυacuteλλογος ) is attested in Thuc. 6 . 75 . 3 -4 . Thuc. 4 . 25 . 7 refers to a faction which allegedly in 425 was ready to betray the city to Syracuse (cf. Thuc. 6 . 88 . 1 for the general hostility of Kamarina towards Syracuse). Parmenides of Kamarina was victorious at Olympia in 528 (Diod. 1 . 68 . 6 = Olympionikai 125 ), and so was Psaumis in 456 and 452 ( Olympionikai 280 , 292 ; cf. Pind. Ol . 4 -5 ). The town of Kamarina was founded on a narrow coastal plateau between the rivers Hypparis and Oanis (for the situation of the city in relation to rivers, see Cordano and Di Stefano ( 1997 )). During the C4s/Timoleontic phase the site comprised a fortified area of not less than 150 ha.There is no evidence of a circuit wall contemporary with the foundation. The C6s circuit wall, with later phases, probably enclosed an area larger than that ascertained for the earliest habitation phase. It was built as a double curtain-wall in a mixture of ashlar and small polygonal techniques with internal fill. Part of the upper structure in sun-dried brick has been found, and there were gates corresponding to the routes westwards to Gela (no. 17 ), inland, and eastwards to Heloron (no. 18 ) and Syracuse (no. 47 ). An outer proteichisma wall was raised outside the north wall along the river Hypparis (Pelagatti ( 1970 ); Cordano and Di Stefano ( 1997 ) 294 -96 ). Structural remains from the earliest phases of the site have been found above all in the western part of the later city, close to the coast on the promontory proper, near the estuary of the river Hypparis and the harbour. The Archaic remains show an organic layout with an overall alignment of the individual structures and a specific cult area, the Athena Polias sanctuary on the highest part of the plateau. Habitation in the early period consisted of single houses and house plots with open areas. The orientation was respected by the Geloan refoundation of 461 (Pelagatti ( 1976 ) 122 -25 ). The C5 city comprised three plateiai , whereas the northeastern part of the city with two further plateiai belongs to the C4s/Timoleontic foundation; for the public works of this phase, fortifications and sewers, see Cordano and Di Stefano ( 1997 ) 292 -97 . The part of the city facing the sea and the port was from early times laid out as public space; the vast area may have been divided into a mercantile agora and a civic-political agora (Pelagatti ( 1984 -85 ) 683 -94 ; Di Stefano ( 1993 -94 ) 1367 -71 ). Recent investigations at the mouth of the river Hypparis have uncovered remains of an impressive harbour structure, in part going back to the Archaic period (Di Stefano ( 1990 )). The major sanctuary of the city, undoubtedly dedicated to Athena, has roots in the Archaic period, but the extant remains of the temple are of C5f (Di Stefano ( 1984 -85 ) 729 -37 ). Athena was the patron divinity of Kamarina (schol. Pind. Ol . 5 ), and the epithet Poliaochos is used by Pind. Ol. 5 . 10 -11 . An archive of C5m lead tablets listing citizens and the phratries and triakades to which they belonged (Cordano ( 1992 )) was deposited in the temple (Di Stefano ( 1992 )) and demonstrates the importance of Athena. The rev . type of litrai issued after the 461 resettlement depicts Athena armed,and the cult statue of Athena Polias may have portrayed her as Athena Promachos (Rutter ( 1997 ) 138 ). Votive terracottas from the site show Athena also as Ergane (Martin et al . ( 1979 ) 520 ). C5l coin types depicting the main divinities of the city, Herakles and Athena (Westermark and Jenkins ( 1982 ) 57 -8 ; Westermark ( 1998 ) 376 ), and personifications of the river-god Hipparis and the nymph Kamarina may also be evidence of cults (Lacroix ( 1965 ) 115 -16 ). Apollo Patroos is attested in C5 (Manganaro ( 1995 ) 98 -103 ). A suburban sanctuary of Demeter south of the city has yielded a few architectural remains and rich votive deposits.Figurines of the type showing Demeter with a piglet attest to the Thesmophorian aspect of the cult (Giudice et al . ( 1979 ); cf. Pelagatti ( 1980 -81 ) 716 -18 ; Hinz ( 1998 ) 119 -21 ). The earliest cemeteries were situated to the north-east (Dieci Salme) and the east (Rifriscolaro) of the city. About 2 , 000 tombs are known at Rifriscolaro from the period of the first generation of settlers (Pelagatti ( 1980 -81 ) 719 -23 ). The Classical cemetery belonging to the 461 refoundation was located south-east of the city at Passo Marinaro, where about 8 , 000 m ² have been investigated so far (Di Stefano ( 1984 ) 55 n. 1 with refs.; Orsi ( 1990 )). Coinage began after the refoundation of Kamarina by Hippokrates with an issue of didrachms on the Attic standard: obv . helmet on a shield; rev . palm-tree flanked by greaves, legend: ΚΑΜΑΡΙΝΑΙΟΝ or ΚΑΜΑΡΙ (Westermark and Jenkins ( 1980 )). This issue lasted only to 484 , when the city ceased to exist. Kamarina as resettled in 461 by Gela issued a series of silver litrai: obv . flying Nike; below, a swan; rev . Athena standing and armed, legend: ΚΑΜΑΡΙΝΑΙΟΝ (-ΟΣ ); this issue ended c. 440 ( SNG Cop. Sicily 158 -60 ). A survey of fractional coins is found in Westermark and Jenkins ( 1982 ) 48 -52 . The next issue dates from c. 420 , the period of full Syracusan influence: tetradrachms on the Syracusan standard, obv . Athena as charioteer; rev . head of Herakles in lion-skin ( SNG Cop. Sicily 161 -63 ; a rare variant has rev . head of Herakles: Westermark ( 1998 )). Some dies are signed by engravers. Didrachms have obv . head of the river-god Hipparis; rev . nymph Kamarina riding a swan ( SNG Cop. Sicily 164 ); legend ΚΑΜΑΡΙΝΑ , ΚΑΜΑΡΙΝΑΙΟΝ . Hemidrachms have obv . head of nymph; rev . flying Nike with shield (Westermark and Jenkins ( 1980 )). Litrai have obv . head of Athena; rev . Nike with wreath; the legend ΚΑΜΑΡΙΝΑΙΑ probably implies σφραγίς vel sim .; one rare litra has rev . head of Herakles wearing lion-skin (Westermark and Jenkins ( 1982 ) 56 -57 ). These issues ended with the banishment of the inhabitants in 405 (Westermark and Jenkins ( 1980 ); Cutroni Tusa ( 1987 )). A single gold coin may be from an issue struck as a result of Carthaginian pressure in 405 (Westermark and Jenkins ( 1980 ) no. 206 ; Rutter ( 1997 ) 148 , 154 ). Bronze was minted from C5s ( SNG Cop. Sicily 166 -69 ); a bronze issue of C4s depicts obv . Athena with helmet, legend: ΚΑΜΑΡΙΝΑΙΩΝ ; rev . free horse prancing ( SNG Cop. Sicily 170 )."
29,Kasmenai (Kasmenaios),Sikelia,37.05,14.5,878,4532,"29 . Kasmenai (Kasmenaios) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 05 , long. 14 . 50 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: α . The toponym is Κασ µ ένη , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 155 . 2 ), Κασ µ έναι (Thuc. 6 . 5 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is Κασ µ εναῖος (Steph. Byz. 364 . 2 ). Kasmenai is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 7 . 155 . 2 . Apart from the entry in Steph. Byz., the city-ethnic is attested only as a conjecture in Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 5 (Pais ( 1894 ) 560 -64 ; recently sustained by Di Vita ( 1987 )), which, if accepted, yields an attestation of the external collective use rC6m. Kasmenai was founded in 644 / 3 (Thuc. 6 . 5 . 3 ) by Syracuse (no. 47 ), probably as a colony, although there is no mention of an oecist. The location and the urban layout ( infra ) point to a military settlement (Di Vita ( 1990 ) 350 ). Kasmenai was a polis according to Herodotos,and the site is defined as type A here,but the polis status must remain uncertain,though Pais' conjecture of Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 5 ( supra ) would tend to support polis status by providing an instance of the external collective ethnic. Hansen ( 1997 a ) 36 classifies Kasmenai as a dependent polis of Syracuse, i.e. as a polis founded as a fortress. See also Akrai (no. 10 ) and Heloron (no. 18 ). If the conjecture in Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 5 ( supra ) is correct, Kasmenai was allied with the Syracusans against Kamarina in C6m. A C5e bronze plaque ( IGDS no. 219 ) found near Monte Casale is a grant ( εψαφίσαν [ το ]) of ateleia etc., possibly by Kasmenai (though this is highly uncertain, see IGDS no. 219 with refs.). The text refers to γά µ οροι , and according to Hdt. 7 . 155 . 2 the Syracusan gamoroi expelled by the demos in a civil strife in 491 took refuge at Kasmenai. Cf. Asheri in CAH v² . 768 . Kasmenai is with near certainty identified as the urban site on the top of Monte Casale c. 12 km west of Akrai (Marotta D'Agata and Moreschini ( 1992 )). The settlement was founded on a high plateau ( c. 70 ha), bounded by steep slopes and with no direct access to a hinterland. Apart from the natural defences the plateau was protected by a sturdy circuit wall 3 . 4 km long, 3 m wide, built in megalithic technique and with at least three square towers along the north side. Its date is uncertain, but the wall is often considered to be contemporary with the foundation, or a little later (Adamesteanu ( 1986 ) 110 ). A double curtain-wall, a diateichisma (?), along the south-eastern side of the north-west plateau, the upper terrace and so-called acropolis, may date from C4f, and may therefore be taken as a later reinforcement due to Carthaginian pressure (Martin et al . ( 1979 ) 531 , fig. 73 ). The settlement was laid out according to a well-defined plan already in C7s. The urban plan consists of at least forty narrow streets oriented north-north-west to south-southeast, at right angles to the long axis of the plateau and delimiting insulae c. 25 m wide: an early stage of Western Greek urban planning (Martin et al . ( 1979 ) 533 ). The rather simple layout may reflect the function of a fort or garrison defending the territory of Syracuse. Quite apart from the apparent lack of a chora , the morphology of the site is unsuitable for a colony proper,and the nature of the votive material from the shrine may also point to a military function (Di Vita ( 1961 ); Marotta D'Agata and Moreschini ( 1992 ) 291 ). However, against this it should be noted that 'The sheer number of inhabitants, some 7 -8 , 000 altogether, shows that the site must have been a proper town, and that some 2 , 000 soldiers max.must have been garrisoned in the town with their families . Also, no more than ca. 60 % of the town has been excavated and the absence of e.g. an agora and public space in general carries no weight as the evidence stands' (Hansen ( 2000 ) 198 -99 ). An analysis of aerial photographs of the plateau of Monte Casale also shows that unexcavated areas were part of the urban layout (Martin et al . ( 1979 ) pl. on p. 528 ). The only public architecture known at Kasmenai is the temenos with temple located on the western plateau and aligned with the overall urban layout. The sanctuary was squeezed into a small area otherwise given over to habitation (Voza ( 1976 -77 ) 561 -62 ). The temple has two phases: an early one c. 560 and a later one 525 -500 (Ciurcina ( 1977 ) 72 -73 ), but the temenos has a C7l origin. A votive deposit of hundreds of javelins,swords and arrowheads indicates a cult of a martial divinity ( supra )."
30,Katane (Katanaios),Sikelia,37.3,15.05,2126,10636,"30 . Katane (Katanaios) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 30 , long. 15 . 05 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Κατάνη , ηasper (Hecat. fr. 73 ; Thuc. 6 . 51 . 3 ; C5f coins, infra ) or Κατάνα ( IG iv² . 1 95 . ii . 71 ( 356 / 5 )). The city-ethnic is Καταναῖος (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 11 ; C5m coins; IG ii² 162 (C4f)). Katane is called a polis in the urban sense by Hecat.fr. 73 and Thuc. 6 . 51 . 1 -2 , and in the political sense at Thuc. 7 . 14 . 2 and in Arist. Pol . 1274 a 24 , a passage which also refers to the πολῖται . It is called patris by Diod. 11 . 49 . 2 (r 476 ) and 11 . 76 . 3 (r 461 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C5m coins ( infra ), and the external use in Thuc. 6 . 3 . 3 and IG i³ 291 .b. ii . 15 ( 415 ); the external individual use is attested by Arist. Pol . 1274 a 23 (rC6s) and IG ii² 162 (C4f). The territory is termed γηtilde at Thuc. 3 . 116 . 1 and chora by Diod. 11 . 49 . 1 (r 476 ), who names it Καταναία (ibid.). It comprised parts of the fertile plains delimited inland by Etna and the Monti Siracusani with the Sikel settlements of Hybla Geleatis, Inessa, Kentoripa (no. 31 ) and Piakos (no. 43 ; Manganaro ( 1996 a ) 26 ), in all about 400 km ² . However, Leontinoi (no. 33 ), the earlier foundation, may have dominated part of this area, leaving a more limited area for the direct use of Katane. Chalkidian expansion far inland to the south-west of Katane and Leontinoi is revealed by the Chalkidian legal texts found at the settlement of Monte San Mauro (Frasca ( 1997 )). The C6m indigenous centres show a notable degree of Helation, probably evidence of a Chalkidian dominion comprising also the lowland plains of the rivers Simeto, Dittaino (for a phrourion at M. Turcisi, cf. Procelli ( 1988 -89 )) and Trigonia. The chora of Katane was bounded to the south by the territory of Leontinoi (cf.Thuc. 6 . 65 . 1 ) and to the north by that of Naxos (no. 41 ; Procelli ( 1989 ) 684 -89 ; Manganaro ( 1996 a ) 25 , 29 ). The territory suffered from an eruption of Etna in 426 / 5 (Thuc. 3 . 116 ), and in 415 / 14 it was ravaged by Syracusan forces (Thuc. 6 . 75 . 2 ). Katane was founded by 'Thoukles and the Chalkidians from Naxos' (Thuc. 6 . 3 . 2 ; cf. Hellan. fr. 82 ), after these had founded Leontinoi in the fifth year after the foundation of Syracuse (i.e. 729 : Thuc. 6 . 3 . 2 ). According to Thuc. 6 . 3 . 3 , the Katanaians 'themselves made Euarchos their oecist' (Leschhorn ( 1984 ) 11 -13 ), implying that the city obtained autonomous status soon after its foundation. Thuc. 6 . 3 . 3 possibly implies that the Greeks drove out the Sikel population, and there is tenuous archaeological evidence supporting this (Procelli ( 1992 )). In 476 , Hieron transferred the populations of Katane and Naxos to Leontinoi, renamed Katane as Aitna and settled it with 10 , 000 oiketores : 5 , 000 from the Peloponnese and 5 , 000 from Syracuse (Diod. 11 . 49 . 2 ); though the report on the relocation of populations refers to both Katane and Naxos, Katane seems to have been the site refounded as Aitna (no. 8 .I): καιgrave τηgraveν µ εgraveν Κατάνην µ ετωνό µ ασε Αίτνην , τηgraveν δεgrave χώραν ου µ όνον τηgraveν Καταναίαν αλλαgrave καιgrave πολληgraveν τηtildeς οasper µ όρου προσθειgraveς κατεκληρουacuteχησε , µ υρίους πληρώσας οικήτορας . (Cf. Strabo 6 . 2 . 3 , who focuses exclusively on Katane in his report on the foundation of Aitna.) After Hieron had died in 466 , the Katanaians returned in 461 and expelled the Aitnaians (Strabo 6 . 2 . 3 ), according to Diod. 11 . 76 . 3 after several battles ( πλείοσι µ άχαις ) between the Hieronian settlers and Syracuse as well as the Sikels under Douketios. Cf. further Aitna (no. 8 .I). In 403 Dionysios I was able to take possession of Katane through the betrayal of the city by the strategos Arkesilaos: the inhabitants were sold into slavery and the city granted to Campanians (Diod. 14 . 15 . 1 -3 ), who in their turn were transplanted to Aitna in 396 . After that date the demographic history of the city becomes obscure: it is mentioned again in 353 when it was taken by Kallippos, Dion's murderer (Plut. Dio 58 . 4 ). In 394 , the surviving Katanaians were settled by Rhegion (no. 68 ) in Mylai (Diod. 14 . 87 . 1 ), but presumably had to scatter across the island when Mylai fell to Dionysios later that year (Diod. 14 . 87 . 3 ). Katane was presumably among the Chalkidikai poleis allied with Leontinoi (no. 33 ) in its war with Syracuse (no. 47 ) in 427 and may, with its ally, have sent an embassy to Athens asking for help in 427 (Thuc. 3 . 86 . 2 -3 ; cf. Andoc. 3 . 30 with Albini ( 1964 ) 100 ). Nikias' letter at Thuc. 7 . 14 . 2 mentions Katane as an ally ( ξυacute µµ αχος ) of Athens (no. 361 ) in 414 / 13 (though Diod. 13 . 4 . 2 reports that it was originally in favour of Syracuse); the treaty was concluded ( εψηφίσαντο . . . ξυ µµ αχίαν Αθηναίοις ) in 415 at an assembly ( εκκλησία ) attended by Athenian strategoi and against the wishes of a pro-Syracusan faction (Thuc. 6 . 50 . 3 -51 . 2 ). Cf. IG i³ 291 .b. ii . 15 ( 415 ): a payment by Katane to Athens. IG ii² 162 is a C4f grant of Athenian proxeny to two men of Katane. A citizen of Katane served as theorodokos of Epidauros (no. 348 ) in 356 / 5 ( IG iv² . 1 95 . ii . 71 ; cf. Manganaro ( 1996 a ) 46 n. 81 ). There is no evidence for Archaic or C5 tyranny at Katane. According to Arist. Pol . 1274 a 23 , Charondas of Katane legislated for his own city as well as for other Chalkidian cities.An ekklesia is attested for 415 (Thuc. 6 . 51 . 2 ) and a strategos is mentioned at Diod. 14 . 15 . 1 (r 403 ). In 344 , the city was ruled by the tyrant Mamerkos/Markos, who initially sided with Timoleon (Diod. 16 . 69 . 4 ) but then joined Carthage only to be betrayed by οιasper συgraveν αυτΩsubiotaῶ who handed Katane over to Timoleon (Plut. Tim . 34 ). The urban layout at Katane is virtually unknown. The initial settlement occupied the acropolis above the coastal plain and harbour, today occupied by Piazza Dante and the Convento dei Benedettini; structural remains from this period are scarce, but Protocorinthian material confirms a C8s Greek presence (Rizza ( 1980 -81 ) 769 , pl. 186 . 1 -2 , ( 1981 ) 316 , figs. 4 -6 ), and there are remains of C6 habitation structures (Giudice et al . ( 1979 ) 139 -40 ). Traces of C8 habitation have been revealed below the acropolis near the ancient coastline (A. Patanè ( 1993 -94 ) 907 ), and the size and location of the ancient harbour are reviewed by Lagona ( 1996 ). In the later Classical period the habitation area incorporated also the lower plateau, probably with an agora located on the site of the later Roman forum close to the theatre and odeion . The theatre where the ekklesia met in 415 (Frontin. Str . 3 . 2 . 6 ) was located on the southern slopes of the plateau. Remains date mainly from the Roman period, but its size (seating capacity c. 7 , 000 ) may reflect that of the Greek theatre (Mitens ( 1988 ) 100 -3 ; TGR ii. 428 -30 , C5 ?). The few Greek remains are from C5 (Anti ( 1947 ) 125 , 128 ; Bacci ( 1980 -81 a )). The adjacent Roman odeion may also have had a Greek predecessor, possibly a bouleuterion (proximity of theatre and bouleuterion is known from other sites; cf. Kolb ( 1981 ) 88 ). On the southern slope of the acropolis a rich C6 -C4 votive deposit has revealed a sanctuary. The cult of the early phase may have been that of Hera, although the evidence is tenuous. The votive terracottas show that from C5 the cult was that of Demeter and Kore, with whom Hieron, as a Deinomenid, had special bonds (Rizza ( 1960 ), ( 1996 ) 12 -13 , pl. 1 ; Hinz ( 1998 ) 161 -63 ). The central area of the Roman city may suggest the approximate extent of the Greek city. To the west this was delimited by the acropolis, to the north by the C6l-C5e cemetery (Orsi ( 1918 )), to the north-east by the river Amenanos,and to the south-east by the sea,in all occupying an area of 75 -100 ha (cf. Rizza ( 1996 ) 11 -12 ). According to Thuc. 6 . 51 . 1 (r 415 ), the city had a circuit wall, destroyed in 403 by Dionysios (Diod. 14 . 15 . 2 -3 ). Katane began striking coins rather late compared with other Sicilian poleis , perhaps due to political or economic dependence on Naxos (Manganaro ( 1996 a ) 29 ): minting started c. 461 on the Attic standard (with denominations based on the tetradrachm) at the time of the return of the former inhabitants relocated by Hieron to Leontinoi (for a survey of the coinage, see Manganaro ( 1996 b )). The types are obv . man-headed river-god Amenanos crowned by a flying Nike; rev . Nike running and holding a wreath or fillet, legends: ΚΑΤΑΝΕ , ΚΑΤΑΝΑΙΟΝ or, more rarely, ΚΑΤΑΝΑΙΟΣ (Manganaro ( 1996 b ) 307 -8 ; SNG Cop. Sicily 174 -75 ). These issues are sometimes thought to predate 476 (Head, HN ² 130 , followed by Marotta D'Agata et al . ( 1987 ) 156 ), but there is greater consensus for dating them as an inauguration issue, to 461 (Stazio ( 1978 ) 191 , 194 ; Manganaro ( 1996 b ) 305 ). After C5m the obv . type of the tetradrachms, a quadriga, reveals the influence of Leontinian and Syracusan issues; rev . head of Apollo, legend: ΚΑΤΑΝΑΙΟΝ , from C5l ΚΑΤΑΝΑΙΩΝ (Manganaro ( 1996 b ) 309 ; SNG Cop. Sicily 176 -79 ). From c. 402 tetradrachms were signed by the engravers Herakleides and Euainetos: obv . Apollo en face ; rev . quadriga, legend: ΚΑΤΑΝΑΙΩΝ (Manganaro ( 1996 b ) 309 -10 ; SNG Cop. Sicily 180 ). Varied issues of lower denominations c. 450 -402 are based upon drachms and fractions (types: quadriga, head of Amenanos, Silenos, bull) and upon the litrai and fractions (types: Silenos, stylised thunderbolt) (C. Boehringer ( 1982 ); Manganaro ( 1996 b ) 308 , 310 -11 ; SNG Cop. Sicily 181 -84 )). The earliest bronze coinage is dated c. 405 (Manganaro ( 1996 b ) 311 ); coins with rev . butting bull were probably minted by Mamerkos and the Campanian mercenaries settled at Katane by Dionysios between 403 and 396 (Manganaro ( 1996 b ) 312 -13 ; SNG Cop. Sicily 184 ). Timoleontic issues follow in C4m: obv . head of nymph; rev . man-headed bull,Amenanos (Manganaro ( 1996 b ) 313 ). A group of C5l hemidrachms, obv . head of Apollo,legend: ΛΕΟΝ ; rev . butting bull, legend: ΚΑΤΑΝΑΙΩ , may be evidence of collaboration between Leontinoi and Katane in the face of Syracusan pressure in 404 -403 (Manganaro ( 1996 b ) 311 -12 ; C. Boehringer ( 1998 ) 51 ), or-perhaps rather-it may be an issue of the Campanian mercenaries settled in Katane by Dionysios I in 403 ; in that case the legend ΛΕΟΝ may attest to Leontinian dependence upon Katane (Kraay ( 1976 ) 229 ; Corretti et al . ( 1990 ) 532 )."
31,Kentoripa (Kentoripinos),Sikelia,37.35,14.45,647,3126,"31 . Kentoripa (Kentoripinos) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 14 . 45 . Size of territory: ? Type: C: γ . The toponym is Κεντόριπα , τά (Thuc. 6 . 94 . 3 ; Polyb. 1 . 9 . 4 ; Strabo 6 . 2 . 4 ) or Κεντουacuteριπαι , αιasper (Ptol. Geog . 3 . 4 . 7 ). The city-ethnic is Κεντόριψ in Thuc. 7 . 32 . 1 and Κεντοριπῖνος on C4 coins ( infra ) and in Diod. 13 . 83 . 4 , 14 . 78 . 7 , etc. Thuc. 6 . 94 . 3 calls Kentoripa a πόλισ µ α Σικελῶν ; it is called a polis in the urban sense at Diod. 16 . 82 . 4 (r 339 ), where the political sense is possibly a connotation. Politai is found in Porph. Devita Pythag . 21 (rC6l) ( = Aristox. fr. 17 , Wehrli). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4 coins ( infra ), and the external collective use in Thuc. 7 . 32 . 1 , Porph. De vita Pythag . 21 (rC6l) ( = Aristox. fr. 17 , Wehrli) and Diod. 13 . 84 . 4 (rC5l). Thuc. 6 . 94 . 3 describes Kentoripa as a Sikel community; and it is implicitly described as Sikel at Diod. 14 . 78 . 7 (r 396 ). A claim or pretension to Greek identity may be implied by the Greek names of its Classical rulers (Damon,Nikodemos; infra ) and Greek-style coins were issued by the Timoleontic refoundation ( infra ). At 6 . 94 . 3 , Thucydides relates how in 414 the Athenians won over Kentoripa by homologia , and at 7 . 32 . 1 the Kentoripes are described as Athenian symmachoi in 413 . In 396 , Damon, the ruler of Kentoripa, made a syntheke with Dionysios I (Diod. 14 . 78 . 7 ); this Damon may possibly have been appointed proxenos by Athens (no. 361 ) ( IG ii² 32 ( 385 / 4 )). Reception of a presbeia from Akragas (no. 9 ) is attested at Diod. 13 . 83 . 4 (rC5l). A meeting of the ekklesia is attested by Diod. 13 . 83 . 4 (rC5l). Porph. De vita Pythag . 21 (rC6l) ( = Aristox. fr. 17 , Wehrli) refers to a tyrant by the name of Simichos who renounced his rule upon becoming a Pythagorean.At Diod. 14 . 78 . 7 (r 396 ) a Damon is described as δυναστευacuteων Κεντοριπίνων , and at 16 . 82 . 4 (r 339 ), a Nikodemos is described as Κεντοριπίνων τυacuteραννον and is said to have been ousted from his city by Timoleon,who gave Syracusan citizenship to its freed inhabitants (ibid.). The phrase used by Diodorus, Συρακοσίους εποίησε , suggests to Moggi, Sin . 357 that the inhabitants, along with those of Agyrion (no. 7 ), were transferred to Syracuse; Agyrion was later assigned new citizens (Diod. 16 . 82 . 5 ), and so presumably was Kentoripa, although this is not explicitly stated. A Timoleontic refoundation is, however, reflected in the striking of a new coinage ( infra ) and in craft production of Greek type (R. P .A. Patanè ( 1992 ) 69 , 73 ). The archaeological evidence from the city's Heled phase is mainly C4s and Heltic, but urban remains are few (Marotta D'Agata and Rizza ( 1987 ) esp. 236 -38 ; R. Patanè ( 1988 )). Bronze litrai were struck briefly under Timoleon after the ousting of Nikodemos in 339 / 8 (cf. R. P . A. Patanè ( 1992 ) 69 ): obv . head of Kore surrounded by dolphins (so-called Euainetos type, taken over from Syracuse); rev . leopard, legend: ΚΕΝΤΟΡΙΠΙΝΩΝ (Head, HN ² 135 ; SNG Cop. Italy 209 )."
32,Kephaloidion (Kephaloiditas),Sikelia,38.0,14.0,577,3073,"32 . Kephaloidion (Kephaloiditas) Map 47 . Lat. 38 . 00 , long. 14 . 00 . Size of territory: ? Type: C: γ . The toponym is Κεφαλοίδιον , τό (Diod. 14 . 56 . 2 ; C5l-C4e coins, infra ); or Κεφαλοιδίς (Archestratos of Gela fr. 35 . 6 , Olson and Sens; Strabo 6 . 2 . 5 ); Ptol. Geog . 3 . 4 . 3 has Κεφαλοίδις , ηgrave Κεφαλωίδης . The city-ethnic is Κεφαλοιδίτας (C5l-C4e coins, infra ); schol. Theoc. Id . 1 . 118 b gives Κεφαλοίδιος . No source calls Kephaloidion a polis (though ταυacuteτης at Diod. 20 . 56 . 3 (r 307 ) may mean 'this polis '; a chora is referred to at Diod. 20 . 77 . 3 (r 306 )); it is included here on account of a coinage presumably struck by/in the community and on stylistic grounds dated to C5l-C4e (Cutroni Tusa and Tullio ( 1987 ) 211 ). Both silver (drachms, hemidrachms and litrai) and bronze coins were struck: obv . head of Herakles; rev . butting bull (from C4m replaced by a Pegasos on bronzes). The legends are unusual and difficult to interpret; the following variants are found: (a) obv . ΕΚ ΚΕΦΑΛΟΙ∆ΙΟΥ , rev . ΗΡΑΚΛΕΙΩΤΩΝ ; (b) obv . ΚΕΦΑΛΟΙ∆ΙΤΑΝ , rev . ΗΡΑΚΛΕΙΩΤΑΝ ; (c) ΚΕΦΑΛΟΙ∆ΙΤΑΝ . While (c) can be interpreted as an ordinary legend of a civic coinage of Kephaloidion,(a) and (b) seem to involve a foreign group,the Herakleiotai , of unknown origin. Ek Kephaloidiou of (a) probably means 'based on Kephaloidion' (Kraay ( 1979 ) 29 ) and suggests that the Herakleiotai had been admitted to Kephaloidion as a group; the double legend of (b), naming both the Kephaloidians and the Herakleiotans, suggests that the latter had been admitted to citizenship by a block grant but kept their individual identity; this would suggest that Kephaloidion was a polis at the time of the minting of these coins (Head, HN ² 118 ; Consolo Langher ( 1961 ); Cutroni Tusa and Tullio ( 1987 ) 210 -11 ). (Bernabò Brea ( 1975 ) 24 -29 assigns the issues to a period of autonomy, independent from Carthaginian rule, after the treaty with Himilkon ( infra ); cf. also Jenkins ( 1975 ) 92 -99 for a downdating of some of the issues to the period of Timoleon.) Kephaloidion was originally a settlement located on the confines of Himeraian and Sikel territories.In 396 , Himilkon of Carthage concluded a treaty of friendship with Himera and 'those settled at the phrourion of Kephaloidion' ( τουgraveς τοgrave Κεφαλοίδιον φρουacuteριον κατοικουtildeντας : Diod. 14 . 56 . 2 ). Whether these latter were Greeks is not clear, but they were presumably not Himeraians. At Diod. 14 . 78 . 7 (r 396 ) Kephaloidion is implicitly described as Sikel, but the Greek-style coinage discussed above suggests Helation; it was captured διαgrave προδοσίας by Dionysios I in 396 (Diod. 14 . 78 . 7 ) and is not met with again before the time of Agathokles (Diod. 20 . 56 . 3 (r 307 ), 77 . 3 (r 306 )). The archaeological evidence at the site is mainly Heltic, but the massive circuit wall in polygonal technique may go back to C4 ; the layout of the mediaeval city may in its main lines coincide with that of the ancient city (Cutroni Tusa and Tullio ( 1987 ) 211 -14 )."
33,Leontinoi (Leontinos),Sikelia,37.15,15.0,2312,11429,"33 . Leontinoi (Leontinos) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 15 , long. 15 . 00 . Size of territory: 4 . Type:A: α . The toponym is Λεοντῖνοι ( IG i³ 54 . 1 ; Thuc. 6 . 3 . 3 ). The city-ethnic is Λεοντῖνος (Thuc. 3 . 86 . 2 -3 ). Leontinoi is called a polis both in the urban sense (Thuc. 5 . 4 . 3 -4 ; Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 ) and in the political sense (Thuc. 3 . 86 . 2 ; Arist. Pol . 1316 a 35 -39 ). The territorial sense is a connotation at Thuc. 5 . 4 . 3 , and the political sense is a connotation at Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 (cf. Hansen ( 2000 ) 175 -76 , 205 ). Politai is used at Thuc. 5 . 4 . 2 , and so is demos . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested on C5f coins ( infra ), and the external collective use by Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 , Thuc. 5 . 4 . 2 and IG i³ 54 . 18 (C5m). The external individual use of the ethnic is found at Xen. An . 2 . 6 . 16 , Pl. Ap . 19 E and CEG 2 830 . 1 (C4f). Leontinoi was one of the early Chalkidian colonies in Sicily, founded by Chalkidians from Naxos under the leadership of Theokles five years after the foundation of Syracuse (i.e. traditionally 729 : Thuc. 6 . 3 . 3 ; cf. Hellan. fr. 82 ). However, Theokles can hardly have been the oecist of Leontinoi, as well as Naxos (cf. Leschhorn ( 1984 ) 12 ). Leontinoi is the only primary colony of the Greek West situated inland. According to Strabo 6 . 2 . 7 , the territory ( γηtilde , Thuc. 5 . 4 . 2 ; χώρα , Diod. 5 . 8 . 2 ) of Leontinoi, called ηasper Λεοντίνη (Thuc. 5 . 4 . 4 , 6 . 65 . 1 ) or τοgrave Λεοντίνων / Λεοντῖνον πεδίον (Theopomp. fr. 225 a. 60 ; Diod. 4 . 24 . 1 ), belonged to the Naxians; this must refer to the Naxian origin of Leontinoi. The territory of Leontinoi probably encompassed most of the modern plain of Catania,about 400 km ² . It is not possible to define a borderline between Katanaian and Leontinian territory. The sources stress the beauty of Leontinoi's chora (Diod. 4 . 24 . 1 ) and the importance of grain crops (Diod. 14 . 58 . 1 (rC4e)). The north gate of Leontinoi led to the Leontine plain (Polyb. 7 . 6 ). The Chalkidian dominion reached far inland along the Simeto and the Dittaino river valleys, possibly as far as Monte San Mauro, Grammichele, Morgantina and Kenturipe (Procelli ( 1989 ); see Katane (no. 30 )). The population history of Leontinoi was eventful: according to Thuc. 6 . 4 . 1 , the group of Megarians led by Lamis who eventually founded Megara (no. 36 ) for some time lived as citizens ( ξυ µ πολιτευacuteειν ) at Leontinoi but were expelled ( εκπεσεῖν ). In 476 , Hieron of Syracuse transplanted the populations of Naxos (no. 41 ) and Katane (no. 30 ) to Leontinoi (Diod. 11 . 49 . 2 ).After the Congress of Gela in 424 , new citizens ( politai ) were enrolled in Leontinoi, and the demos contemplated a redistribution of land. The result was civil war, in which οιasper δυνατοί summoned the Syracusans.The demos was expelled, whereas οιasper δυνατοί moved to Syracuse (no. 47 ), where they obtained citizen rights, although 'later' ( υasperacuteστερον ) some returned to the old city (Thuc. 5 . 4 . 2 -4 ; cf. Dreher ( 1986 )). Leontinoi ceased to be a polis , and its site was turned into a phrourion of Syracuse (Diod. 12 . 54 . 7 ); the Athenians had the refoundation of Leontinoi as one of their principal alleged motives for undertaking the expedition to Sicily in 415 (Thuc. 6 . 33 . 2 , 48 . 1 , etc.). In 405 / 4 Leontinoi was resettled by citizens of Gela (no. 17 ) and Kamarina (no. 28 ; Diod. 13 . 113 . 4 ), and the treaty concluded that year between Dionysios I and Carthage stipulated that like, e.g., Gela, the city was to be autonomos , and this must have meant the refoundation of the city (Diod. 13 . 114 . 1 ). Two years later ( 403 / 2 ), Dionysios conquered Leontinoi and moved all its inhabitants to Syracuse (Diod. 14 . 14 -15 ); in 396 Dionysios resettled Leontinoi with,allegedly, 10 , 000 mercenaries (Diod. 14 . 78 . 2 ). In 339 , the population was transplanted to Syracuse by Timoleon (Diod. 16 . 82 . 7 ). From Thuc. 3 . 86 . 2 -3 it appears that in 427 Leontinoi had treaties of symmachia with 'the Chalkidian poleis ' , Kamarina and Rhegion (no. 68 ), and that these allies were also allied with Athens (by individual treaties; see ML 63 -64 with comm.),and that they were capable of acting as a body ( HCT ad loc . on οιasper τῶν Λεοντίνων ξυacute µµ αχοι ). Thuc. 4 . 24 . 9 attests to a treaty of symmachia between Leontinoi and Naxos in 425 . During the reign of Dionysios II, Leontinoi seceded from Syracuse and twice resisted attempts to reconquer the city, the first by Philistos in 356 / 5 (Diod. 16 . 16 . 1 ), the second in 342 / 1 by Timoleon (Diod. 16 . 72 . 2 ). Leontinian φυγάδες are mentioned at Thuc. 6 . 19 . 1 . Several wars fought by Leontinoi are attested: a C6 war with Megara peri ges horon is referred to by Polyaen. 5 . 47 . 1 , and a C5s war with Syracuse by Thuc. 3 . 86 . 2 . Campaigns are mentioned at, e.g., Thuc. 4 . 25 . 10 , and a στράτευ µ α τῶν Λεοντίνων at Thuc. 4 . 25 . 11 . The C7l-C6e tyrant Panaitios served as polemarchos (Polyaen. 5 . 47 . 1 ). Leontinoi was conquered by Hippokrates and made a dependency of Gela (Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 ) c. 496 / 5 (Luraghi ( 1994 ) 128 -29 , 148 -50 ). Reception of envoys is attested by Diod. 14 . 14 . 3 ; IG i³ 54 . 4 -6 (C5s) names three Leontinian presbeis , and Gorgias was sent as an envoy to Athens in 427 (Pl. Hp. mai . 282 B). A citizen of Leontinoi served as theorodokos of Epidauros (no. 348 ) in 356 / 5 ( IG iv² . 1 95 . ii . 66 ). In the Archaic period Leontinoi was sometimes ruled by a tyrant; two are mentioned by our sources: Panaitios, who in C7l changed the oligarchy (Arist. Pol . 1315 b 34 -37 ) to tyranny ek demagogias (Arist. Pol . 1310 b 29 , 1316 a 37 ; Luraghi ( 1994 ) 11 -20 ) and Ainesidamos (Paus. 5 . 22 . 7 ). A C6stasis between the demos and the ruling oligarchs is reported by Polyaen. 5 . 47 . 1 and another stasis in 424 between the dynatoi and the demos by Thuc. 5 . 4 . 2 -3 (Berger ( 1992 ) 25 -26 ). Symbouleutic oratory ( en toi demoi ) at Leontinoi is mentioned by Pl. Hp. mai . 128 A. The urban layout of Leontinoi is known in some detail from the description given by Polyb. 7 . 6 . The defensive system of the city is among the best preserved in Sicily. The C6 circuit wall enclosed the San Mauro and Metapiccola hills and the central valley with gates at either end (Rizza ( 1978 ); for chronology,see Tréziny ( 1986 ) 187 ; for the fortification of the Leontinian acropolises, cf. Diod. 14 . 58 . 1 (r 396 )). The C6e(?) outer ashlar circuit wall of the east and south side of Colle San Mauro crossed the narrow San Mauro valley with a pincer-like gateway (the Syracusan gate of Polybios) and continued along the west and south sides of the Metapiccola plateau. The defences were destroyed by Hippokrates c. 496 / 5 , reconstructed and extended in C5m and destroyed in C5l (cf. Diod. 14 . 14 . 4 ; Rizza ( 1955 ) 281 -88 , 346 -76 ; cf. Dreher ( 1986 )). The north gate has been identified in the substantial remains of a C5 ashlar wall in isodomic technique, and part of the foundation of a round tower was found in the northern outlet of the San Mauro valley (Martin et al . ( 1979 ) 585 ; Spigo ( 1980 -81 a ) 794 ). The city was walled again in 356 / 5 (Diod. 16 . 16 . 1 ) and besieged in 342 / 1 (Diod. 16 . 72 . 2 ). A theatre is attested in C4m (during the reign of Dion) when it housed a meeting of the assembly (Plut. Dio 42 . 8 -43 . 1 ). Archaeological evidence (habitation structures and abundant C8 -C7 ceramic material) has revealed a first Greek habitation phase on the Colle San Mauro. There are indications of an initial close relationship between Greek and Sikel settlers (Rizza ( 1962 ), ( 1978 )). The C7 -C6settlement phase incorporated also the Metapiccola hill, and the total extent of the two plateaux with the central valley within the C6 circuit wall was about 40 ha. There are remains of terraced houses on the western slope of the Metapiccola hill overlooking the San Mauro valley (corroborating the description given by Polybios). These are mainly Heltic, but they have a C7 phase (Rizza ( 1980 -81 ) 767 -68 ; Spigo ( 1980 -81 a ) 793 -94 ). According to Thuc. 5 . 4 . 4 , one district in the city was called Phokaia. Neapolis, another part of the city, was attacked by Timoleon in 342 / 1 (Diod. 16 . 72 . 1 ), and was perhaps originally an extra-urban settlement founded by Hieron in 476 to house the inhabitants from Katane (no. 30 ) and Naxos (no. 41 ) (Diod. 11 . 49 . 2 ). According to Polyb. 7 . 6 , the agora was situated in the central valley, as were the law courts, dikasteria ; his mention of sanctuaries on the city plateaux is confirmed by the archaeological evidence (Barletta ( 1983 ) 38 -45 ). Extensive C5s-C4e cemeteries lay on plateaux north of the city,at some distance from it, whereas tombs, spanning the Archaic and Heltic periods, lay just outside the south gate of the city along the road leading to Syracuse (Martin et al . ( 1979 ) 585 -87 ; Rizza ( 1982 )). From the evidence of the coins, Artemis or Demeter (cf. Diod. 5 . 4 . 2 ) and Apollo were venerated at Leontinoi. An external collective dedication of a silver phiale at Delos is recorded in I.Delos 104 . 93 ( 366 ) and IG ii² 1643 . 21 (C4m). The earliest coinage, based upon the Syracusan-Attic standard,was issued in connection with Hieron's settlement of the inhabitants of Katane and Naxos at Leontinoi in 476 (C. Boehringer ( 1998 ) 43 -44 ). This first series of tetradrachms use the Syracusan lambda in the legend and reveal strong Syracusan stylistic influence: obv . quadriga and Nike; rev . lion's head (a pun on the city's name) surrounded by four grains of barley, legend: ΛΕΟΝΤΙΝΟΝ (C. Boehringer ( 1998 ) pl. 10 . 1 -5 , 7 -10 , etc.; SNG Cop. Sicily 334 -37 ). A second series, from c. 466 , have similar obv . but with a running lion in exergue (as in the Syracusan 'Demarateion' coinage); rev . female head (Artemis or Demeter), or head of Apollo wearing laurel wreath, legend: ΛΕΟΝ , ΛΕΟΝΤΙΝΟΝ ( SNG Cop. Sicily 341 -43 ; C.Boehringer ( 1998 ) pls. 10 . 14 -19 , 11 . 30 -32 ). A third series of tetradrachms belong c. 450 : obv . laureate head of Apollo; rev . lion head surrounded by barley grains, legend: ΛΕΟΝ , ΛΕΟΝΤΙΝΟΝ , ΛΕΟΝΤΙΝΟΣ (with Chalkidian lambda , cf. Johnston ( 1975 ); SNG Cop. Sicily 346 -52 ; C.Boehringer ( 1998 ) 47 , pl. 11 . 33 -37 , etc.). Lower denominations carry related types, and on rev . of litrai a naked youth (river-god or Apollo) offering a libation at an altar ( SNG Cop. Sicily 353 -57 ; cf. C. Boehringer ( 1998 ) 47 -48 for the change in the system of denominations with refs. to plates). The issue of tetradrachms may have continued until c. 415 (C. Boehringer ( 1998 ) 50 -51 ). For an issue of hemidrachms possibly indicating collaboration between Leontinoi and Katane or Leontinian dependence upon Katane, see entry for Katane. Bronze coins were issued from c. 405 ( SNG Cop. Sicily 358 -61 ; C. Boehringer ( 1998 ) 51 -52 ). Leontinoi founded the colony of Euboia (no. 15 ) (Strabo 6 . 2 . 6 ) at an unknown site in the Chalkidian hinterland, perhaps as early as C8l if it was contemporaneous with the foundation of Mylai (no. 38 ; the two sites are coupled by Ps.-Skymnos 287 -88 ); Euboia seems to have been a settlement of some importance in C5f, since it was worthy of being relocated by Gelon (Hdt. 7 . 156 . 3 ; Camassa ( 1989 a ))."
34,Lipara (Liparaios),Sikelia,38.3,14.55,1892,9541,"34 . Lipara (Liparaios) Map 47 . Lat. 38 . 30 long. 14 . 55 . Size of territory: 2 ( = size of island). Type: A: α . The toponym is Λιπάρα , ηasper ( SEG 37 414 (C5f)); Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 1 ; Thuc. 3 . 88 . 2 ; cf. Λιπάραι in Polyb. 34 . 11 . 19 , where the plural 'die Stadt Lipara [i.e. in contradistinction to the island] zu bezeichnen scheint,da Polyb.sonst Λιπάρα sagt'(Ziegler in RE xiii. 719 ; cf., however, Diod. 5 . 7 . 1 claiming homonymity between island and polis ); Μελιγουνίς is said by later sources to have been an earlier name of Λιπάρα (Callim. Hymn . 3 . 47 ; Strabo 6 . 2 . 10 ). The city-ethnic is Λιπαραῖος (C5s coins, infra ; Thuc. 3 . 88 . 2 ), although Κνίδιος ( ελ Λιπάραι ) seems to have been used as well ( SEG 37 414 (C5f)). Lipara is called a polis in the urban sense by Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 1 = Paus. 10 . 11 . 3 (r time of foundation) and Arist. Mete . 367 a 6 . In later sources Lipara is called a polis in the political sense at Polyb. 1 . 21 . 5 and in the urban sense at Diod. 14 . 56 . 2 (r 396 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested by C5s coins ( infra ) and the external collective use in Thuc. 3 . 88 . 2 , Arist. Mete . 367 a 6 and presumably on the C5f Liparan dedication at Delphi ( Syll . ³ 14 (C6l-C5e) = SEG 34 405 , 37 414 ; cf. BTCGI 9 : 101 ff). The individual use of the ethnic is found in F.Delphes iii . 4 401 ( 315 ) and IG ii² 9214 (C3e). Mythology told of a settlement of the island by Liparos (Diod. 5 . 7 . 5 ), who founded the polis and was joined by Aiolos (ibid. and 4 . 67 . 4 ; cf. Hom. Od . 10 . 1 ). The historical community was founded by apoikoi from Knidos (no. 903 ; Thuc. 3 . 88 . 2 ; Antiochos ( FrGHist 555 ) fr. 1 ; Strabo 6 . 2 . 10 ; cf. Hornblower ( 1991 ) 496 ). However, according to Diod. 5 . 9 . 2 -5 , the foundation was the outcome of a joint KnidianRhodian expedition to western Sicily under the leadership of Pentathlos of Knidos, in the fiftieth Olympiad, i.e. 580 -576 . Pentathlos was killed in war supporting Selinous (no. 44 ) against Segesta, and the leadership of the group was taken over by Gorgos, Thestor and Epithersides; the expedition found at Lipara 500 indigenous inhabitants of Aiolos' line whom they joined. Antiochos of Syracuse ( FGrHist 555 , fr. 1 as preserved in Paus. 10 . 11 . 3 ), while agreeing on the leadership of Pentathlos, differs inter alia from Diodorus' account in naming only Knidians as colonisers (as does Thuc. 3 . 88 . 2 ), and in stating that before settling at Lipara the expedition had founded a polis at Cape Lilybaion (Pritchett ( 1999 ) 98 -100 ), from which they were expelled by Elymians and Phoenicians.For the role of Knidians in the venture, see also the C5f Delphic dedicatory inscription: τοιgrave Κνίδιοι [ ε ] λ Λιπάραι ( F.Delphes ii . 1 142 ; LSAG 351 n. 1 ; Syll . ³ 14 ; SEG 37 414 ; Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1991 ) 102 -3 ). According to the Eusebian chronology, the foundation took place in 630 / 29 , but Diodorus' date is supported by the chronology of the votive material from the urban sanctuary and by mortuary evidence (Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1991 ) 137 , 150 ). Lipara was the centre of habitation among the Aiolian Islands (Thuc. 3 . 88 . 2 : οικουtildeσι δ ' εν µ ιηsubiotaαtilde τῶν νήσων ου µ εγάλ Αsubiota η , καλεῖται δεgrave Λιπάρα ), of which there were seven in all (Diod. 5 . 7 . 1 ; Strabo 6 . 2 . 10 ), known also as αιasper Λιπαραίων νηtildeσοι (ibid. and 1 . 3 . 10 ; Polyb. 1 . 25 . 4 ; Diod. 12 . 54 . 4 , 14 . 103 . 2 , cf. Syll . ³ 14 ). Lipara itself, measuring 37 . 5 km ² , is fertile (cf. καρπόφορος at Diod. 5 . 10 . 3 and ευacuteκαρπος at Strabo 6 . 2 . 10 ), and there is sporadic evidence of single farmsteads and agricultural activity from C6 . However, the area exploited for agricultural purposes was not limited to Lipara but included the other islands (Thuc. 3 . 88 . 2 ; Diod. 5 . 9 . 4 -5 ); Diodorus gives a detailed account of the socio-economic development of the community, referring inter alia to such institutions as syssitia , absence of private property and close community control of the agricultural areas which were publicly owned (ibid.without source reference). In 427 / 6 the Liparaians were symmachoi of Syracuse (no. 47 ), and in that year the Athenians and Rhegians ravaged their territory (Thuc. 3 . 88 . 1 -4 ; Diod. 12 . 54 . 4 ). According to Diod. 5 . 9 . 4 , the community maintained a fleet which was manned by a group of citizens devoting themselves specifically to that duty, while the rest were occupied with agriculture.The existence of a fleet may also be inferred from the repeated defeats of Etruscan forces ( infra ). A strategos is attested in 393 (Diod. 14 . 93 . 4 ). The Liparaians fought several wars against the Etruscans,at least until the battle of Kyme ( 474 ), and they won several victories which were commemorated by monuments at Delphi (Diod. 5 . 9 . 5 ; Strabo 6 . 2 . 10 ; Paus. 10 . 11 . 3 ; cf. Rota ( 1973 ) and Colonna ( 1984 )), dedications that may be taken as evidence of extreme wealth on the island (Paus. 10 . 16 . 7 ). At the time of Hieron, but before 474 , the Etruscans besieged and captured Lipara (Callim. fr. 93 , Pfeiffer; Tzetz. Chil . 8 . 889 -92 ). In 396 Himilkon occupied the polis of Lipara and exacted 30 tal. from the inhabitants (Diod. 14 . 56 . 2 ). In 393 ( 396 according to Roman chronology) the Liparaian strategos Timositheos liberated Roman ambassadors taken prisoner by Liparaian pirates while on their way to Delphi; for this service the Romans conferred on Timositheos the right of public hospitality (Diod. 14 . 93 ). Lipara's relations with Delphi seem to have been close: consultation of the oracle in the face of the Etruscan threat is attested by Paus. 10 . 16 . 7 ; in C5 -C4 the city put up votives and dedicated booty taken from the Etruscans (Diod. 5 . 9 . 5 ; Paus. 10 . 11 . 3 , 16 . 75 ; cf. Syll . ³ 14 ; Rota ( 1973 ) and Colonna ( 1984 )); a Delphic grant of proxeny to two Liparaians is recorded in F.Delphes iii . 4 401 ( 315 ), and Lipara was among the cities visited by the theoroi of Delphi in C3s (Manganaro ( 1964 a ); SEG 22 455 , col. 4 . 117 ). The city was founded on a promontory c. 65 m above sea level; the 'acropolis' of the city (a modern designation) comprised habitation, but there was also a lower city on the western slope of the 'acropolis' . The site had two harbours, probably north and south of the promontory (Diod. 5 . 10 . 1 ). The circuit wall built in a polygonal technique and raised c. 500 enclosed the acropolis and part of the lower city; however, the exact course is not wholly clarified (Bernabò Brea ( 1987 ) 20 ). In C4f the perimeter of the circuit wall was enlarged to incorporate the C4expansion of the lower city; the new wall was built in ashlar, isodomic technique as a double curtain-wall with internal fill, 3 . 80 m wide,strengthened with towers (ibid. 20 -23 ). The most extensive cemetery with c. 2 , 000 tombs lay to the north of the city (Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1991 ) 146 -54 ). No Greek remains of habitation from the Archaic and Classical periods are extant, but early Greek presence is evidenced by votive deposits. The only known public building is the C4 prytaneion (Diod. 20 . 101 . 2 (r 304 )). Votive deposits testify to sanctuaries within the urban area (Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1977 ) 89 -91 ). Further votive deposits delimited by primitive peribolos walls indicate simple temene . Sporadic finds of architectural terracottas testify to a temple or naiskos (Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1991 ) 139 ). There is evidence of suburban sanctuaries, one probably dedicated to Demeter (Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1977 ) 133 -35 ; ( 1991 ) 158 -59 ). A C6m inscription restored ΑΙΟ [ ΛΟΥ ] (Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1977 ) 90 ) may testify to a cult of this mythical figure (cf. Diod. 20 . 101 . 2 (r 304 ) for dedications allegedly set up by Aiolos and kept in the prytaneion ). A cult of Hephaistos is adduced from C5s coins, easily explained in the light of volcanic activity on the Lipari islands. Coins also testify to a cult of Apollo. A C4 -C3 dedication probably attests to a cult of Artemis (Manganaro ( 1979 ); Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1991 ) 90 , 158 ), and there is epigraphic evidence for a cult of Aphrodite (Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1991 ) 90 ; cf. 168 for refs. to iconographic testimonies). A cult of Dionysos is sometimes inferred from the abundant New Comedy terracottas (Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1991 ) 161 -62 ). Lipara struck a bronze coinage based upon the litra from C5s (survey in Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1991 ) 109 -21 ). The obv . depicts a male head with helmet or, more likely, a pilos and therefore Hephaistos; rev . ship's stern; legend: ΛΙΠΑΡΑΙΟΝ ; lower denominations lack the stern ( SNG Cop. Sicily 1084 -85 ). A rare issue of Lipara and Mytistratos with the legends ΛΙΠ and ΜΥ suggests some agreement or understanding between the two cities, but the nature of this is uncertain (Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1991 ) 112 -13 ). A second issue, probably of C4 rather than C5l, based on the litra but of reduced weight, with lower denominations, has obv . young, naked seated Hephaistos holding hammer and kantharos; rev . dolphin, among variants: head of Apollo(?), rev . legend: ΛΙΠΑΡΑΙΩΝ ( SNG Cop. Sicily 1088 -96 ; for the date, see Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1991 ) 117 -18 ). Another C4 issue may indicate cultural and political kinship with Taras (Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1991 ) 114 )."
35,Longane (Longenaios),Sikelia,38.05,15.1,388,2002,"35 . *Longane (Longenaios) Map 47 . Lat. 38 . 05 , long. 15 . 10 . Size of territory: ? Type: C: β . The forms of the cityethnic suggest such forms for the toponym as * Λογγάνη or * Λογγήνη , but the only attested form is Λογγώνη , in Steph. Byz. 418 . 19 , who gives the corresponding ethnic as Λογγωναῖος ; Steph. cites Philistos ( = FGrHist 556 , fr. 38 ), but for which detail is unclear. The city-ethnic is Λονγεναῖος in IG xiv 319 ( = IGDS no. 200 ; cf. Hornbostel and Hornbostel ( 1988 ) 234 ), a C5m kerykeion inscribed Λονγεναῖος ε µ ι δε µ όσ ( ιος ); it is Λογγαναῖος on C5l coins ( infra ). On the basis of Polyb. 1 . 9 . 7 , Longane is located near Mylai (no. 38 ), and the river Longane (ibid.) may be the river Loitanos of Diod. 22 . 23 . The city has been tentatively identified with the considerable remains of a settlement on Monte Ciappa, above modern Rodi and Milici, where C5evidence of Helation is found in the form of ashlar technique in the circuit wall,a rectangular building complex outside the walls (perhaps a sanctuary), and, finally, mortuary evidence (Ryolo di Maria ( 1950 -51 ); Massa ( 1991 ); Bernabò Brea and Carettoni ( 2000 )). However, other sites with urban remains have been put forward as candidates for the site (Wilson ( 1988 ) 125 ). No Archaic or Classical source calls Longane a polis , but the kerykeion ( supra ) and the Greek-style coins ( infra ) suggest that it was a polis and suggest Helation as well. Longane minted bronze litrai from C5l, a date suggested by the similarity with Geloan coins of c. 415 -405 : obv . Herakles wearing lion skin, legend: ΛΟΓΓΑΝΑΙΟΝ ; rev . personification of river-god, Longanos (Jenkins ( 1975 ) 99 -101 ; Massa ( 1991 ) 250 -51 ). (Manganaro ( 1984 ) 36 -37 argues for a c. C4m date for this coinage and therefore reads the legend not as an ethnic but as an adjective.) If Longane is correctly located inland somewhere between Milazzo and Tyndaris (no. 49 ), its coinage is virtually the only coinage in that area."
36,Megara (Megareus),Sikelia,37.1,15.1,2367,12210,"36 . Megara (Megareus) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 10 , long. 15 . 10 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Μέγαρα , τά (Thuc. 6 . 49 . 4 , 75 . 1 ), or Μεγαρίς (Ps.-Skylax 13 ) (it is unclear what is meant by τοgrave Μεγαρικόν at Polyaen. 1 . 27 . 3 (r 483 )); this is the simple name which is qualified in different ways to distinguish it from Megara Nisaia (no. 225 ): Thuc. 6 . 94 . 1 has Μέγαρα ταgrave εν ΣικελίΩsubiotaα , and Theopomp.fr. 70 has Μέγαρα τηtildeς Σικελίας . In addition to the toponym proper, the plural of the city-ethnic may be used to designate the city (in contradistinction to the community ): Thuc. 6 . 4 . 1 : Μεγαρέας Ωsubiotaώκισαν (cf. Ziegler in RE xv . 1 . 206 ; see also HCT on Thuc. 6 . 94 . 1 ). According to Ephor. fr. 137 a/b (as paraphrased by Strabo 6 . 2 . 2 (a) and Ps.-Skymnos 264 (b)), the original name was /asperacuteΥβλα (presumably from the Sikel king Hyblon (Thuc. 6 . 4 . 1 )). The city-ethnic is Μεγαρευacuteς (Hdt. 7 . 156 . 2 ; Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 5 ), which is also qualified in different ways to distinguish it from the ethnic of Megara Nisaia: Μεγαρευgraveς οasper εν Σικελίηsubiotaη (Hdt 7 . 156 . 2 ; cf. Pl. Leg . 630 A); Thuc. 6 . 4 . 1 : Μεγαρευgraveς οasper ' Υβλαῖος . Megara is called a polis in the urban sense at Thuc. 6 . 4 . 2 and Ps.-Skylax 13 ; Hdt. 7 . 156 . 2 does not explicitly call it a polis in the political sense, but that it was so is the obvious implication of the passage, which discusses Megara alongside other communities that were obviously poleis . At Thuc. 6 . 4 . 3 metropolis almost certainly applies to Megara Nisaia (no. 225 ) ( HCT ad loc .). Pl. Leg . 630 A uses πολίτης about one of its citizens. The external collective use of the city-ethnic is found in Hdt. 7 . 156 . 2 , Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 5 (rC6m) and Pl. Leg . 630 A. The name of the territory was presumably Μεγαρίς (cf. IvO 22 . fr. ab. 1 (C6l) with Dubois ad loc . in IGDS p. 34 ; cf. Diod. 4 . 78 . 1 and Steph. Byz. 588 . 7 ); it is termed χώρα at Thuc. 6 . 4 . 2 and γηtilde at 6 . 94 . 1 . It consisted of the coastal lowland on both sides of the city facing the bay of Augusta and was demarcated by the territories of Leontinoi (no. 33 ) and Syracuse (no. 47 ), i.e. by the valleys of the river Porcaria (ancient Pantakyas) and the river Anapo (ancient Anapos) respectively. It measured c. 400 km ² (Vallet, Villard and Auberson ( 1983 ) 149 -50 ; De Angelis ( 1994 ) 92 -93 ). According to Steph. Byz. 588 . 7 , Styella was a phrourion in the territory of Megara (cf. Steph. Byz. 645 . 4 citing Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 20 ). Styella has been tentatively located on the western confines of Megara's territory (Bernabò Brea ( 1968 ) 178 -79 ). In C7l, Megara was involved in war περιgrave γηtildeς οasperρῶν with Leontinoi; it was fought during the reign of Panaitios of Leontinoi (Polyaen. 5 . 47 ; for the C7l date of Panaitios: Luraghi ( 1994 ) 11 -14 ). According to Thuc. 6 . 4 . 1 -2 Megara was founded by a colonising expedition from Megara Nisaia (no. 225 ) led by Lamis. The expedition at first settled at Trotilos on the river Pantakyas, whence it moved on to Leontinoi and settled ( ξυ µ πολιτευacuteειν ) there with the Chalkidians for a while; it was, however, expelled ( εκπεσεῖν ) and went on to settle at Thapsos. Here Lamis died; the remnants of the expedition left Thapsos and founded Megara ( Μεγαρεῖς ' Υβλαῖοι ) on land put at their disposal by the Sikel king Hyblon (for an analysis of the textual transmission of the tradition of the Sikels and the foundation of Megara, see Graham ( 1988 )). According to Thucydides the Megarians were driven out by Gelon (in 483 ) 245 years after the foundation, giving a foundation date of 728 , thus later than the foundation of Syracuse. A different tradition was followed by Ephor. fr. 137 , whose account is preserved in Strabo 6 . 2 . 2 (and Ps.-Skymnos 264 -77 ). According to this tradition, Megara (given the initial name of /asperacuteΥβλα ) was founded ten generations after ταgrave Τρωικά by the same expedition, led by Theokles of Athens, which also founded Naxos (no. 41 ). The Athenian origin here ascribed to Theokles (who was from Euboian Chalkis (no. 365 )) undoubtedly reflects later Athenian claims to have played a role in the early colonial enterprises in Sicily (Bérard ( 1957 ) 78 -79 ); Theokles' expedition included both Ionians, who founded Naxos, and Dorians (mostly Megarians), who founded Megara, and according to Ps.-Skymnos 276 -77 this double foundation was the result of stasis (along ethnic lines?) among the colonisers. According to Strabo 6 . 2 . 4 , the foundations of Megara, Naxos and Syracuse were roughly contemporary, but a group of Dorians who had left the group settling at Megara were picked up by Archias and joined his group of colonists in founding Syracuse; so in this tradition the foundation of Megara preceded that of Syracuse (ibid.; cf. Ps.-Skymnos 276 -77 ). Archaeological evidence has revealed Greek presence at Megara from C8m (Villard and Vallet ( 1964 ) 15 -32 ) and therefore contemporary with the earliest Greek presence at Syracuse (Pelagatti ( 1978 c ) 130 -33 ); the evidence for C8m Greek contacts in the hinterland of Megara at Villasmundo is not necessarily associated with the foundation of the colony (Voza ( 1973 b )). A C6m treaty of symmachia with Syracuse is attested by Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 5 , and Megarian troops assisted Syracuse in a war against Kamarina. In C5e Megara initiated a war against Syracuse (Hdt. 7 . 156 . 2 ) but with disastrous results: Megara was unable to withstand a siege by Gelon, partly because of stasis (Polyaen. 1 . 27 . 3 ), and c. 483 the city had to accept terms whereby the demos was sold into slavery whereas the pachees were relocated to Syracuse and received citizenship there (Hdt. 7 . 156 . 2 ); Megara ceased to exist as a polis , its site lay abandoned in 415 (Thuc. 6 . 49 . 4 ), and the territory was held by Syracuse (Thuc. 6 . 94 . 1 ). The city must have been refounded by Timoleon c. 338 ; admittedly,Megara is not specifically mentioned as a Timoleontic refoundation, but archaeology proves a refoundation, which must be related to Timoleon's programme of refoundations (Talbert ( 1974 ) 149 ). We know next to nothing of the type of constitution at Megara. A C6stasis may be hypothesised as causing the expulsion of citizens received as exiles at Selinous ( IvO 22 ; IGDS no. 28 ). One Diognetos was άρχων when the city was attacked by Gelon in 483 (Polyaen. 1 . 27 . 3 ). The term αισι µ νάτας in IvO 22 (C6l) refers to a magistracy attested also in Megara Nisaia (no. 225 ) and other Megarian colonies (cf. Dubois on IGDS no. 28 fr.b. 5 -6 with refs.); however, from the context it is not discernible whether the reference is to Selinous (no. 44 ) or to Megara. For the office in general, see Asheri ( 1979 b ) 490 . IvO 22 mentions a halia ([h α ] λία διαίτεσ [ ε ]; Arena ( 1989 ) no. 52 fr. h. 4 ; Asheri ( 1979 b )), but again it is uncertain whether the reference is to Megara and whether αasperλία should be interpreted as an ekklesia or as a special court (Asheri ( 1979 b ) 490 ). IGDS no. 20 is a lex sacra of C6e. The evidence for cults is meagre: a dedication to heroes theoi (Arena ( 1989 ) no. 78 ) and an uncertain C3 dedication to Aphrodite (Manni Piraino ( 1975 ) 150 ). Apart from this there is the indirect evidence of a C6f sacrificial law set up by one Pasaratos, or for a local, otherwise unknown, hero Pasaratos ( SEG 26 1084 = IGDS no. 20 ; cf. Sartori ( 1980 -81 ) 267 ). Cf. also Manni ( 1975 ) 190 -91 and Vallet ( 1991 ) 515 for numismatic evidence of doubtful provenance. Megara was founded on a flat coastal plateau of c. 81 ha, previously uninhabited.Only a small part of the total area of habitation has been investigated. Soon after the foundation the urban area was laid out with habitation, public spaces and main lines of communication, respected by the later C7 urban phase, when the city was organised according to major and minor transversal axes with insulae organised in five districts laid out around a central agora (Vallet et al . ( 1976 )). The five districts may mirror different contingents among the early settlers, reflecting the five komai of the metropolis Megara Nisaia (Strabo 8 . 6 . 22 ; cf. Vallet et al . ( 1983 ) 145 -46 ); or they may simply be the successors of early scattered habitation areas,each with public spaces and sanctuaries (Polignac ( 1999 ) 227 ), superseded in C7l by a centralised urban layout implying standardised modules for the habitation lots (Tréziny ( 1999 )). The earliest habitation remains are C8l houses of a type known also at Syracuse and Naxos. Yet a habitation area has been investigated on the southern plateau, c. 500 m south of the main urban area. Remains of a gate and a C7m double-faced circuit wall in rough stones with internal fill, strengthened on the outside by a trench, have been laid bare. C8 habitation, a C7 potters' workshop and a sanctuary of C7f-C6 reveal the impressive extent of the early colony: a settlement measuring c. 60 ha (Broise et al . ( 1983 ); Gras ( 1984 -85 ); Tréziny ( 1999 ) 176 -79 ). On the assumption that about half of this area was urbanised, the C7 population has been estimated at c. 2 , 000 (De Angelis ( 1994 ) 97 -99 ), probably a much too pessimistic assessment (Hansen ( 1997 b ) 74 n. 153 ). The C7m circuit wall was replaced in C6s by a well-built ashlar wall, of which a stretch is preserved on the northern side of the city and landwards by stretches of a long curving wall, in all c. 1 , 500 m, with semicircular towers on the outside (Vallet et al . ( 1983 ) 97 -101 ). The C6 building near the agora, unconvincingly identified as a prytaneion (Vallet et al . ( 1983 ) 62 -69 ; cf. S. G. Miller ( 1978 ) 229 -30 ), is undoubtedly a public structure; another monumental structure from c. 640 on the south side of the agora is also furnished with banquet rooms and may have had a public function (Vallet et al . ( 1983 ) 77 -81 ; Kiderlen ( 1995 ) 14 -17 , 215 ). C7s stoas lined the agora on its north and east sides. A number of sacred buildings were located adjacent to, or in the vicinity of, the agora: a two-cella heroon facing the agora may have housed a cult of the oecist Lamis (Vallet et al . ( 1976 ) 209 -11 , ( 1983 ) 62 ). Two C7s naiskoi , one with an internal row of columns but both without peristasis, delimited the agora on its south side (Vallet et al . ( 1983 ) 48 -49 , 69 -70 ); small single-cella temples, naiskoi , are known from various locations in the vicinity of the agora (Vallet et al . ( 1983 ) 44 , 62 ; Polignac ( 1999 ) 215 ). The C6e Doric temple located on the central part of the plateau (Orsi ( 1921 ) 153 -76 ; Villard and Vallet ( 1954 ) 13 -24 ) and C6 temples on the sea front reveal a belt of sanctuaries encircling the habitation area (Polignac ( 1999 ) 216 -20 ; for sanctuaries and cults, see also Hinz ( 1998 ) 141 -43 ). The Timoleontic foundation occupied primarily the north-eastern corner of the Archaic city and was later restricted to an area of 12 ha by the C3l fortification erected before the final destruction of the city by Marcellus in 213 (Livy 24 . 34 . 2 ). Timoleon's city followed, with modifications, the layout of the Archaic city, the agora was reestablished, and sanctuaries and a stoa were erected in the vicinity (Vallet et al . ( 1983 ) 168 -74 ). The Archaic cemeteries were located to the north, west and south of the city: the graves are mainly of C7 -C6 with very few C8 graves. A social elite is indicated by rich, monumental cella tombs (Shepherd ( 1995 ) 56 -60 with refs.), and social differentiation is also attested by Herodotos' distinction between the demos and hoi pachees ( 7 . 156 . 2 ). Megara did not issue coins during its Archaic existence, and the attribution of a silver litra inscribed ΜΕΓΑ to the Timoleontic refoundation (Head, HN ² 151 ) is far from universally accepted (Vallet ( 1991 ) 515 with refs.). Megara was the metropolis of Selinous (no. 44 ), founded in 649 according to Diod. 13 . 59 . 4 , or in 628 according to Thuc. 6 . 4 . 2 . ## Messana (Messanios) See below 51 . Zankle ."
37,Morgantina (Morgantinos),Sikelia,37.25,14.3,1085,5860,"37 . Morgantina (Morgantinos) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 25 , long. 14 . 30 . Size of territory: ? Type: C: β . The toponym is Μοργαντίνη , ηasper (Thuc. 4 . 65 . 1 ; 36 . 5 . 7 ); Μοργαντῖνα , ηasper (C5m coins, infra ; Diod. 11 . 78 . 5 ); or Μοργαντῖνον (Diod. 14 . 78 . 7 ); Strabo 6 . 1 . 6 has Μοργάντιον , τό . The city-ethnic is Μοργαντῖνος (C4s coins, infra ). Morgantina is called a polis in the urban sense at Diod. 11 . 78 . 5 (r 459 ), where the political sense may be a connotation. The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4 coins. Most scholars have identified Morgantina with the Archaic, Classical and Heltic town investigated on the c. 3 km-long Serra Orlando ridge, near Aidone (an identification based mainly upon numismatic evidence: Dubois, IDGS pp. 226 -27 ). The Classical and Heltic city occupied the lower ridge, whereas the Archaic town was situated on the Cittadella hill which rises to the east, and which, in itself, consists of an upper acropolis and two lower plateaux. Morgantina was originally a non-Greek community (Tsakirgis ( 1995 ) 125 ; Antonaccio ( 1997 ) 168 -70 ), and at Diod. 14 . 78 . 7 (r 396 ) it is implicitly described as Sikel. The Archaic settlement of Morgantina has revealed Greek contacts primarily from the mid-sixth century. The Cittadella and adjacent areas have yielded valuable evidence of sanctuaries and naiskoi of Greek type.Foundations of a mid-sixthcentury hekatompedon have been excavated on the upper plateau and a rich harvest of architectural terracottas found on the lower plateaux are evidence of a naiskos in this part of the Archaic settlement too (Barletta ( 1983 ) 49 -67 ; Antonaccio ( 1997 )). A fortification wall was added to the already considerable natural defences of the site in C5e, possibly in response to the expedition of Hippokrates of Gela (Sjöquist ( 1973 ) 45 -46 ; cf. Hdt. 7 . 154 ). The cemeteries, situated on the slopes of the Cittadella hill, have revealed clear evidence of Greek contacts and acculturation from the Archaic period (Lyons ( 1996 )). However, tomb typology suggests continuity of Sikel culture,albeit with some Helation of tomb architecture and typology, and Archaic Morgantina may not have been a mono-ethnic community (Lyons ( 1996 ); see also Antonaccio ( 1997 )). Architectural terracottas and other remains of buildings attest to important C6m-C6l religious structures, some in Greek style (Barletta ( 1983 ) 49 -67 ; for sanctuaries, see Hinz ( 1998 ) 124 -34 ). A survey of the archaeological evidence, with bibliography, is found in Tsakirgis ( 1995 ); cf. also Antonaccio ( 1997 ). By c. 460 , Greek-style coinage was introduced with types that attest to Greek cults ( infra ). Moreover, a kylix of c. 460 carries an inscription ( SEG 38 949 ) indicating the existence of Greek-style civic subdivisions ( eikades ). The C5e destruction phase of Morgantina is most often linked to the activities of Hippokrates of Gela in northeastern Sicily. When captured and refounded by Douketios in 459 / 8 , it became an axiologos polis according to Diod. 11 . 78 . 5 . The new settlement on Serra Orlando was a city founded according to Greek customs: a formal urban layout with plateiai and stenopoi has its origin in this period, though the rich evidence for public buildings dates primarily to the Heltic period (Bell ( 1988 ) 314 -16 ; Tsakirgis ( 1995 ) 126 -27 ). The acts of foundation and the terminology employed by Diodorus in connection with Douketios'foundations in the period 459 -458 are similar to those known from Greek colonial foundations: the presence of an oikistes , the planning of an urban centre, and the division of the chora into lots (cf. Rizzo ( 1970 ) 58 -66 ; Bell ( 1984 -85 ) 505 -6 ; ( 1988 ) 320 -21 ). The peace concluded between the Sicilian cities at the Congress of Gela in 424 implies that Morgantina had been within the sphere of influence of Syracuse prior to 424 (Thuc. 4 . 65 . 1 ); but by the Peace, Syracuse (no. 44 ) handed over Morgantina to Kamarina (no. 28 ) in return for a speci- fied payment ( αργυacuteριον τακτόν ). Morgantina is next listed among the cities taken by Dionysios I during his campaign against the Sikels in 396 (Diod. 14 . 78 . 7 ), and later the city is mentioned in connection with the war between Magon and Dionysios I (Diod. 14 . 95 . 2 ). Morgantina issued an unusually rich coinage which has been divided into the following main groups by Erim (in Buttrey et al . ( 1989 ) 3 -67 ): ( 1 ) silver litrai from c. 465 -450 , stylistically related to contemporary litrai of Gela: obv . bearded head wearing taenia (an unidentified local divinity); rev . ear of grain, legend: ΜΟΡΓΑΝΤΙΝΑ (retrograde, gamma and rho written in early forms); ( 2 ) c. 370 -350 : tetradrachms of Syracusan type with legend ΜΟΡΓΑΝΤΙΝΩΝ in exergue on rev ., known in two specimens only; ( 3 ) silver litrai, three issues, 344 -317 : (a) 1¼ litra: obv . head of Athena in triple-crested helmet, en face , legend: ΜΟΡΓΑΝΤΙΝΩΝ ; rev . Nike seated on rock ( rev . type reveals stylistic affinities with coins of Terina), legend as on obv .: SNG Cop. Sicily 471 ); (b) litra: obv . female head in profile (Persephone or Artemis,or long-haired Apollo?), legend: ΜΟΡΓΑΝΤΙΝΩΝ ; rev . horseman in chlamys thrusting spear ( SNG Cop. Sicily 472 ); (c) a rare issue known from two specimens, a variant of ( 3 a) above; ( 4 ) bronze coinage, 330 -317 : (a) obv . head of Athena in Attic helmet,legend: ΜΟΡΓΑΝΤΙΝΩΝ ; rev . lion devouring head of stag ( SNG Cop. Sicily 473 -74 ); (b) obv . head of Sikelia (?) or male divinity; rev . eagle standing on snake, legend: ΜΟΡΓ , ΜΟΡΓΑΝ ( SNG Cop. Sicily 475 ); (c) obv . head of Apollo(?), legend: ΛΑΒΟΣ ; rev . tripod, legend: ΜΟΡΓΑΝ . The latter issues are probably Timoleontic (Erim in Buttrey et al. ( 1989 ) 14 -29 ; Karlsson ( 1995 ) 155 , 166 n. 3 (J))."
38,Mylai (Mylaios),Sikelia,,,1310,6759,"38 . Mylai (Mylaios) Map 47 . Lat. 38 . 15 , long 15 . 15 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Μυλαί , αιasper (Hecat. fr. 79 = Steph. Byz. 461 . 6 ; Thuc. 3 . 90 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is Μυλαῖος ( SEG 24 313 -14 (C5e); Diod. 12 . 59 . 5 ). Mylai is described as a πόλις ' Ελληνιgraveς . . . καιgrave λι µ ήν in Ps.-Skylax 13 (cf. Hansen ( 2000 ) 198 ); it is also called a polis in the urban sense at Diod. 14 . 87 . 3 (r 394 ) and by Ps.Skymnos 288 (r time of foundation). The external collective use of the city-ethnic is found in SEG 24 313 -14 (C5e) and in Diod. 12 . 54 . 4 (r 427 ). Even so, Mylai is often thought not to have been been a polis but simply a fortified outpost ( phrourion ) of Zankle/Messana (no. 51 ; Ziegler in RE xvi : 1042 ; Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1992 ) 118 ; Dubois in IGDS ad no. 5 ). Certainly, relations between Mylai and Zankle/Messana seem to have been close. (a) Mylai was founded by Zankle (Ps.-Skymnos 287 ; cf. Strabo 6 . 2 . 6 ) in 716 (Euseb. Chron . sub Ol . 16 . 1 ). (b) Thuc. 3 . 90 . 2 describes it as Μυλαιgrave αιasper Μεσσηνίων and states that έτυχον δυacuteο φυλαιgrave εν ταῖς Μυλαῖς τῶν Μεσσηνίων φρουρουtildeσαι . (c) The term phrourion is applied to the site in Diod. 12 . 54 . 5 bis (r 427 ) and 19 . 65 . 3 (r 315 ). Finally (d), Theophr. Hist. pl . 8 . 2 . 8 uses the phrase εν ΣικελίΩsubiotaα τηtildeς Μεσσηνίας εν ταῖς καλου µ έναις Μυacuteλαις , which seems to indicate that Mylai was conceived of as situated in the territory of Messana (so Ziegler in RE xvi . 1042 ). However,the following should be noted. Re (a), the report on the foundation does not state the purpose of the foundation and there is no compelling a priori reason why Mylai should not have been planned as an ordinary colony and thus as a polis ; but even if it is assumed that it was planned as a military outpost, the examples of Kasmenai (no. 29 ) and Akrai (no. 10 ) indicate that this need not militate against its being a polis (cf. Hansen ( 1997 a ) 36 ), although then presumably a dependent polis . Much more importantly, our earliest sources on Mylai are two dedications of spoils by Messana (no. 51 ) at Olympia that are inscribed ΜΕΣΣΕΝΙΟΙ ΜΥΛΑΙΟΝ ( SEG 24 313 -14 (C5e)); this of course indicates military confrontation(s) between Mylai and Messana and that 'Mylai, at least before being defeated, had been a selfgoverning community and undoubtedly a polis ' (Hansen ( 2000 ) 198 ); see also below on colonisation. Re (b + c), the application of the term phrourion does not exclude polis status for Mylai (cf. Thuc. 8 . 62 . 3 describing the uncontroversial polis of Sestos (no. 672 ) as a phrourion ), and in fact Diodorus varies between phrourion ( 12 . 54 . 5 , 19 . 65 . 3 ) and polis ( 14 . 87 . 3 ). The fact that Mylai in 426 was garrisoned by Messanian forces indicates close military collaboration and suggests again that Mylai was a dependency of Messana, as does Thucydides' phrase Μυλαιgrave αιasper Μεσσηνίων . Describing the events of 426 , however,Diod. 12 . 54 . 2 classifies the inhabitants of Mylai as Μυλαῖοι not as Μεσσήνιοι , and this indicates that it was a community with an identity of its own, distinct from that of Messana. Re (d), the fact that Mylai may have been conceived of as situated in Messanian territory does not mean that it cannot have been a polis , since small poleis situated inside the territory of larger poleis are a well-attested phenomenon (Hansen ( 1997 a ) 31 ). If Mylai was thus situated, this may help to explain Thucydides' statement ( 6 . 62 . 2 ) that Himera (no. 24 ) was the only Greek polis on the Tyrrhenian coast of Sicily (a statement which in any case may refer primarily to north-western Sicily), since a dependent polis inside the territory of another polis may have counted as a polis only in internal matters (Hansen ( 1995 ) 73 -74 ). To conclude, the Messanian dedications at Olympia indicate that Mylai was a polis in C5e, and Ps.-Skylax that it was still a polis in C4 ; it seems to have been a dependent polis of Zankle/Messana, and it is conceivable that its political status may have been subject to change (Hansen ( 2000 ) 198 ). Although presumably situated in the territory of Zankle/Messana ( supra ), the existence of a separate nameηasper Μυλαῖτις χώρα (Polyb. 1 . 23 . 7 ) or τοgrave Μυλαῖον πεδίον (Polyb. 1 . 9 . 7 )-indicates that at least by C3m, and presumably before, Mylai had its own territory (Hansen ( 2000 ) 198 ). The size of Mylai's territory is uncertain, but the fertile coastal plain east and west of the city comprises about 75 km ² . The border with Zankle may have been defined by the famous sanctuary of Artemis Phakelitis located somewhere east of Mylai (Saporetti ( 1979 ); Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1992 ) 116 ; cf. also the entry for Zankle). To the west, Mylai bordered upon the territory of Tyndaris from 396 (cf. Strabo 6 . 1 . 2 ), and to the south-west upon the territory of the indigenous city of Longane. In 427 the Athenians occupied Mylai, forcing upon it an alliance against Messana (Thuc. 3 . 90 . 3 : ηνάγκασαν οasper µ ολογίΩsubiotaα ). In 394 the Rhegians settled at Mylai those Naxians and Katanaians who had survived Dionysios I's exandrapodismos of their cities in 403 (Diod. 14 . 87 . 1 ). Later the same year the city was captured by Messana, and the Naxians (and presumably the Katanaians) were allowed to leave hypospondoi (Diod. 14 . 87 . 3 ). The town of Mylai was situated on a high promontory, the acropolis (mentioned at Thuc. 3 . 90 . 3 ) crowning the 6 . 5 km-long alluvial peninsula joining it to the inland plain. The settlement was founded on an indigenous site. The original Greek settlement seems to have occupied only the upper plateau, though in a later period habitation may have progressed to the slopes below, closer to the sea and the harbour known from the sources (Ps.-Skylax 13 ). There are no structural traces of the Archaic or Classical city, nor of the defences mentioned by Thuc. 3 . 90 . 3 ( ερυacute µ ατα , cf. the poliorkia at Diod. 12 . 54 . 4 (r 427 )). Mylai was still fortified in C4l (Diod. 19 . 65 . 3 (r 315 )). The cemetery located along the principal route across the isthmus took over the site of the indigenous,Bronze Age settlement.The earliest tombs are of C8l, thus confirming the Eusebian date ( 716 ) for the foundation; this cemetery continued in use also in the late Archaic period (Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1959 ), ( 1992 )). According to Strabo, 'the Zanklaians in Mylai' founded Himera ( 6 . 2 . 6 : τηgraveν ' Ι µ έραν οιasper εν Μυλαῖς έκτισαν Ζαγκλαῖοι (r 648 )). If this means that Mylai was the metropolis of Himera (no. 24 ), it will support the suggestion that Mylai itself was a polis in the Archaic period."
39,Mytistratos (Mytiseratinos),Sikelia,37.35,14.0,336,1727,"39 . Mytistratos (Mytiseratinos) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 14 . 00 . Size of territory: ? Type: C: β . The toponym is transmitted as Μυτισέρατος in Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 39 = Steph. Byz. 465 . 12 ; Polyb. 1 . 24 . 11 has Μυττίστρατον , τό , and Diod. 23 . 9 . 4 Μυτίστρατος , ηasper (Diod. 23 . 9 . 4 ). The city-ethnic is given as Μυτισερατῖνος by Steph. Byz. 444 . 13 ; Steph. explicitly cites Philistos ( = FGrHist 556 ) fr. 39 for this form, but presumably wrongly; cf. Jacoby's app. crit. ad loc . Mytistratos is called a polis (in the urban sense) only by Diod. 23 . 9 . 4 (r 258 ), but it is included here on account of the Greek-style coinage ( infra ). Mytistratos is, on numismatic evidence, identified with Monte Castellazzo di Marinopoli. The few C6 -C5 and C4 urban remains, including a circuit wall built in an ashlar technique, are classified as Greek; the later phase with evidence of formal layout is probably Timoleontic (Fiorentini ( 1992 ) 303 -4 ). The main settlement was destroyed in C3f, but habitation continued on an adjoining terrace. Tombs of the investigated cemetery are dated to C4s (Fiorentini ( 1992 ) 302 -5 ). Three series of C4 bronze coins are attributed to Mytistratos, the first two probably Timoleontic: ( 1 ) obv . head of Hephaistos, legend: ΜΥΤΙ ; rev . free horse; ( 2 ) obv . head of Hephaistos; rev . wreath and pellets, legend: ΜΥ (retrograde). A coin of the latter series carries the legends ΛΙΠ ( sc . Lipara (no. 34 ); retrograde) and ΜΥ on rev ., and is evidence of C4m collaboration between the two cities (cf. entry for Lipara). The third issue (C4s): obv . head of Hephaistos; rev . flowers, legend: ΜΥΤ (Fiorentini ( 1992 ) 301 ; Karlsson ( 1995 ) 165 , 166 )."
40,Nakone (Nakonaios),Sikelia,,,281,1359,"40 . Nakone (Nakonaios) Map 47 . Unlocated (Tegon ( 1993 ) 159 -61 ). Type: C: β . The toponym is Νακόνη , ηasper (Steph. Byz. 468 . 3 = Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 26 ). The city-ethnic is Νακοναῖος (C5l coins, infra ) or Νακωναῖος (C4s coins, infra ; SEG 30 1119 . 5 (C4l-C3m)). NoArchaic or Classical source calls Nakona a polis , but it is included here on account of its Classical Greek-style coinage ( infra ) and SEG 30 1119 (C4 -C3 ), a Greek decree of Nakona attesting to the existence of a citizen body ( politai : l. 8 ), a boule (l. 3 ), and an assembly ( halia : l. 3 ), etc.; the decree concerns measures taken to restore civic order after a period of diaphora (l. 10 ); cf. SEG 32 914 pp. 257 -58 . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on Classical coins ( infra ) as well as in SEG 30 1119 . 5 . Nakone minted two series of bronze coins from C5l (Head, HN ² 159 ): ( 1 ) obv . head of nymph, legend: ΝΑΚΟΝΑΙΟΝ ; rev . Dionysos seated on ass and holding kantharos ( SNG Cop.Sicily , Suppl . 71 ); lower denomination: rev . goat; C4s issues in a period of Campanian occupation have been associated with Timoleon and his symmachia : ( 2 a) obv . head of Demeter or Persephone, legend: ΚΑΜΠΑΝΩΝ ; rev . free horse, legend: ΝΑΚΩΝΑΙΩΝ ; ( 2 b) similar but rev . Pegasos (Cutroni Tusa ( 1970 ) 256 -57 ; Tegon ( 1993 ) 158 -59 )."
41,Naxos (Naxios),Sikelia,37.5,15.15,2653,13809,"41 . Naxos (Naxios) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 50 , long. 15 . 15 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Νάξος , ηasper (Thuc. 4 . 25 . 7 , 6 . 3 . 1 ; I.Delos 380 . 85 (rC5 ); cf. Rutherford ( 1998 ) 83 ). The city-ethnic is Νάχιος (coins c. 525 , infra ), or Νάξιος (coins c. 430 , infra ; Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 ; Thuc. 7 . 57 . 11 ). Naxos is called a polis in the urban sense at Thuc. 4 . 25 . 8 , 9 and 6 . 3 . 1 , 50 . 3 , and it is listed, with Tauromenion, as a polis Hel by Ps.-Skylax 13 , although presumably it no longer existed by the time this treatise was compiled (cf. FlenstedJensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 137 ); polis in the political sense is found at Thuc. 7 . 14 . 2 , and the urban and political senses are combined at Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 (cf. Hansen ( 2000 ) 205 ). Patris is found at Diod. 11 . 49 . 2 (r 476 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on coins from c. 525 ( infra ); the external collective use is found in Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 and Thuc. 6 . 50 . 3 and IG xi . 2 245 b 4 (rC5 ; cf. Rutherford ( 1998 ) 82 -83 ). Externally and individually the ethnic is applied to the oecist Theokles ( Suda s.v. ελεγείνειν : Θεοκληtildeς Νάξιος ; cf. Bérard ( 1957 ) 77 n. 1 ) and to the Olympionikes Teisandros (Pind. fr. 23 , Maehler). The name of the territory is unknown; it is termed γηtilde at Thuc. 4 . 25 . 8 . Its extent is not fully known. However, Naxian influence penetrated above all southwards across the Santa Venera and Alcantara river valleys,as borne out by the foundation of the colonies at Leontinoi (no. 33 ), Katane (no. 30 ) and Kallipolis (no. 27 ). The site of Kallipolis is unknown,but the listing of the city with Katane and Leontinoi suggests a location either in the coastal plain south of Naxos or on the slopes of Mt. Etna (see Kallipolis (no. 27 )). The rich C6 -C4 votive deposit from the Demeter and Kore sanctuary in the otherwise unknown secondary settlement at Francavilla c. 4 km inland along the Akesines (modern Alcantara) river valley has revealed Naxian penetration north-westwards (Spigo ( 1989 ); Spigo and Rizzo ( 1993 -94 ); Hinz ( 1998 ) 156 -58 ). To the north the territory bordered upon that of Messana,by whose infantry and navy Naxos was attacked in 425 (Thuc. 4 . 25 . 7 ). Naxos may have had a sanctuary or a secondary settlement also on the higher area of the later foundation of Tauromenion (no. 48 ) (Bacci ( 1980 -81 b ) 742 , ( 1984 -85 ) 722 -23 ); according to Diod. 14 . 88 . 1 , the original colonists had expelled the native population from the site of Tauromenion. Naxos was the earliest Greek colony in Sicily (for the sources for its history, see Cordano ( 1984 -85 )). It was founded by settlers from Chalkis (no. 365 ) on Euboia one year before the foundation of Syracuse, i.e. traditionally 735 / 4 (Thuc. 6 . 3 . 1 ; cf. Diod. 14 . 88 . 1 ), and the traditional date (as well as ties with Euboia) is confirmed by ceramic finds from the earliest period of settlement, 740 -730 (Pelagatti ( 1981 ) 304 -11 ; Lentini ( 1993 -94 ) 1009 ). The oecist was Theokles (Thuc. 6 . 3 . 1 ). The primary status of Naxos is borne out by the tradition that the theoroi of the Sicilian colonies offered sacrifice in the sanctuary of Apollo Archegetes at Naxos before setting sail from Sicily (Thuc. 6 . 3 . 1 ). Ephor. fr. 132 (cf. Ps.-Skymnos 273 -74 ) describes the oecist Theokles as an Athenian , but that undoubtedly reflects later Athenian claims to have played a role in the early colonial enterprises in Sicily (Bérard ( 1957 ) 78 -79 ). Later sources mention Ionian and Megarian participation (Ephor. fr. 137 ). Some of the settlers may have come from Cycladic Naxos (cf. Hellan. fr. 82 ). The Cycladic origin of some of the settlers is supported by the similarity between the coin types used by Sicilian Naxos and by Cycladic Naxos, above all the prominence of Dionysos (Leschhorn ( 1984 ) 10 n. 7 ). In addition, the lettering of the Enyò inscription from the Scalià sanctuary matches that used in Cycladic Naxos (Guarducci ( 1985 )). Naxos was subdued by Hippokrates of Gela,who took the city after a siege (Hdt. 7 . 154 ). In 476 , Hieron of Syracuse transplanted the population of Naxos (and Katane) to Leontinoi, where they were presumably granted citizenship (Diod. 11 . 49 . 2 ), and it seems that he settled new colonists at Naxos (Diod. 11 . 49 . 2 : ιδίους οικήτορας απέστειλεν , though the interest here seems to centre on Katane; but see infra ). The expatriated Naxians presumably returned after Hieron's death, as did the Katanaians (Diod. 11 . 76 . 3 ; Asheri ( 1980 )). According to Thuc. 3 . 86 . 2 , the Chalkidikai poleis to which Naxos belonged were symmachoi of Leontinoi in its conflict with Syracuse in 427 , and the allies seem to have acted as a single body on an embassy to Athens (no. 361 ) ( HCTad loc .); Leontinoi is specifically named alongside άλλοι /asperacuteΕλληνες ξυacute µµ αχοι at Thuc. 4 . 25 . 9 in reference to Messana's attack on Naxos in 425 . During the Athenian attack on Syracuse, Naxos was allied with Athens (Thuc. 7 . 14 . 2 ), and at the battle of Epipolai at Syracuse in 414 hippeis from Naxos supported the Athenians (Thuc. 6 . 98 . 1 ; cf. 7 . 57 . 11 ). In 403 Naxos was betrayed by one of its own citizens, Prokles, described as οasper τῶν Ναξίων αφηγουacute µ ενος , and so presumably a military commander. He surrendered Naxos to Dionysios I,who subjected the city to an exandrapodismos from which it never recovered; the chora of the city was handed over to the Sikels (Diod. 14 . 15 . 2 -3 ). A C5 genos of the Amphikleidai organising Naxian theoriai to Delos is argued by Rutherford ( 1998 ). Naxian survivors were settled at Mylai (no. 38 ) during the conflict between Dionysios, Rhegion (no. 68 ) and Messana (no. 51 ) in 394 (Diod. 14 . 87 . 3 ; cf. McKechnie ( 1989 ) 37 ), but had to find new homes after the Messanians took Mylai (ibid.).In 358 the Naxians were finally settled at Tauromenion (no. 48 ) by Andromachos (Diod. 16 . 7 . 1 ); Tauromenion had been a site in Naxian territory ( supra ), but was constituted as a Greek polis only in C4f. Andromachos himself was its leading citizen when Timoleon arrived in Sicily (Diod. 16 . 68 . 8 ; Plut. Tim . 10 . 6 -8 ); Marcellin, Vita Thucydidis 27 describes him as exercising monarchia . See further the entry for Tauromenion. Naxos itself, however, may not have been completely abandoned: C3 habitation and cult activity is attested there (Pelagatti ( 1976 -77 ) 544 -45 , ( 1980 -81 ) 706 ). So far, the only evidence of civic subdivisions at Naxos consists of inscriptions on two clay bullets with patronymika , implying citizen groups possibly matching a system of phylai or phratriai . The chronology of the inscriptions, of C5e and C5l, indicates continuity of this civic organisation from before until after the period of Hieron (Cordano ( 1988 )). The cult of Dionysos was of major importance at Naxos, as shown by the coin types (Cutroni Tusa ( 1984 -85 ) 296 -97 ) and the number of Silenos antefixes (Pelagatti ( 1977 ) 50 -55 ). A C7l cippus carries a dedication to a warrior-goddess Enyò (Guarducci ( 1985 )), and other evidence points to a cult of the armed Athena (Lentini ( 1993 -94 ) 1016 -17 ). Teisandros of Naxos was victorious four times at the Olympic Games ( Olympionikai 94 ( 572 ) with refs.) and achieved the same number of Pythian victories (Paus. 6 . 13 . 8 ). The town of Naxos was founded on a low coastal peninsula, Capo Schisò, and material from the initial C8l habitation phase extend over an area of c. 10 ha (Pelagatti ( 1981 ) 295 -97 ; survey in Pelagatti ( 1993 ); bibliography in Lentini ( 1998 ) 99 -100 ). The earliest evidence of urban layout is of C7 , with main street axes linking the central part of the city westwards with sanctuaries, eastwards with the harbour, and northwards with a kerameikos (Pelagatti ( 1981 ) 297 -302 ). The exceptional character of habitation near the harbour reveals social differentiation (Lentini ( 1984 -85 ) 815 -21 ). Though a stretch of a Bronze Age fortification laid bare in the Archaic city near the coast ('Castello area') may have been reutilised by the first Greek settlers (Lentini ( 2001 ) 7 ), Naxos was apparently not fortified before C6m or C6l, probably as a result of the threat posed by the expansion of Gela (no. 17 ) in north-eastern Sicily (Naxos eventually had to accept Geloan hegemony (Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 )). The walls, built in polygonal masonry with the use of local black lava basalt rock, are preserved on three sides: along the river Santa Venera and along the two coastlines of the peninsula; northwards the course remains to be clarified. Gates protected by towers were located in alignment with streets of the C7 city which covered an area of c. 35 ha. The earliest, C7l, polygonal temenos wall of the sanctuary south of the city may have functioned also as a dyke along the river Santa Severa (Pelagatti ( 1964 ); ( 1972 ); Gras ( 1998 )). Thuc. 4 . 25 . 8 attests to the existence of fortifications in 425 (Flensted-Jensen ( 1995 ) 128 ); the fortifications were destroyed ( κατασκάπτειν ) by Dionysios in 403 (Diod. 14 . 15 . 2 ). The conquest of the city by Hippokrates in 493 (Hdt. 7 . 154 ) has left no clear traces in the archaeological record, apart from its possible reflection in a C5e structural phase of the circuit wall (Lentini ( 1984 -85 ) 813 ). It is not entirely clear from Diod. 11 . 49 . 1 -2 whether he meant to imply the settlement of a new population at Naxos after the deportation of the inhabitants by Hieron in 476 , but the archaeological evidence attests to replanning and resettlement. The Hieronian city was laid out in accordance with a unitary, strictly orthogonal system with narrow insulae and with a new orientation (Pelagatti ( 1976 -77 ) 537 -43 ; Belvedere ( 1987 ) with refs.; Lentini ( 1998 ) 72 -86 ). Rectangular bases found at the crossing of plateia and stenopoi have been interpreted as horoi marking the confines of city districts (Pelagatti ( 1977 ) 44 -46 ) or as altars (Spagnolo ( 1991 ) 66 n. 78 ). For the archaeological evidence for the destruction in 403 and the C4e history of Naxos, see Lentini ( 2002 ). Anagora is with near certainty identified near the ancient harbour in the north-eastern corner of the city (Lentini ( 1993 -94 ) 1010 -12 ); for harbour installations, see Pelagatti ( 1976 -77 ) 538 , Lentini ( 1993 -94 ) 1009 , and Blackman ( 1997 -98 ). A C7l sanctuary in the south-west corner of the city, near the estuary of the river Santa Venera, at first within the urban area, was superseded by a C6s hekatompedon outside the city wall. Altars, bases for votive stelai , and ovens for ceramic production go back to the early phase of the sanctuary. The identification of the cult as that of Aphrodite, as yet uncertain,rests upon the testimony of App. B. Civ . 5 . 109 , but the river Onobalas mentioned by Appian is normally taken to be the river Serina or Selina near Taormina and not the river Santa Venera (cf. Ziegler, RE xvi . 2 . 2078 ; Valenza Mele ( 1977 ) 504 -5 ). Other interpretations: a Heraion, though with no clear evidence ( pace ibid. 505 -6 ); sanctuary of Apollo Archegetes (Guarducci ( 1985 )), but this was situated outside the city according to Thuc. 6 . 3 . 1 ; cf. HCT ad loc . A location for the Apollo sanctuary near the harbour on the north side of the peninsula,closer to the C8 phase city,seems most logical (Pelagatti ( 1978 a ) 138 ; Valenza Mele ( 1977 ) 505 ), a location also supported by App. B Civ . 5 . 109 , which situates the altar of Apollo north of the city near an anchorage. At least four C7 -C4small urban shrines were located within the Archaic and Classical city (Pelagatti ( 1977 ) 46 -48 , ( 1981 ) 301 , ( 1984 -85 ) 680 -83 ). The cults of these are uncertain. An important suburban sanctuary extended over a vast area west of the city across the river Santa Venera (Lentini ( 1993 -94 ) 1012 -25 , ( 1998 ) 87 -96 ). There are remains of two shrines,altars and votive deposits (prime period: C6m).The two shrines were protected by peribolos walls or embankments. The architectural terracottas, of local production, indicate richly decorated buildings. The C8l-C5f cemetery was situated north of the city (Pelagatti ( 1980 -81 ) 697 -701 ; Lentini ( 1986 )). The C5 cemetery is located west of the city, on the other side of the river Santa Venera, south-west of the sanctuary (Pelagatti ( 1976 -77 ) 544 ). Naxos minted coins from c. 525 on the ChalkidianEuboian standard (Cahn ( 1944 )). The main denomination is the drachm, the smaller denomination the obol (litrai) (C. Boehringer ( 1984 -85 ) 113 -16 ): obv . head of Dionysos; rev . bunch of grapes, legend on both denominations: the ethnic ΝΑΧΙΟΝ ( SNG Cop.Sicily 485 ). This issue most likely terminated in 493 , when the city was taken by Hippokrates.In 461 , when the expatriated Naxians (presumably) returned from Leontinoi,a new coin type was commissioned: a magnificent tetradrachm on the Syracusan-Attic standard; obv . head of Dionysos; rev . squatting Silenos, legend: ΝΑΧΙΟΝ (Head, HN ² 160 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) pl. 44 . 756 ); lower denominations are drachms and litrai inscribed ΝΑΧΙ , ΝΑΧΙΟΝ ( SNG Cop. Sicily 486 -92 ). New issues in 430 carry similar types, legend: ΝΑΧΙΟΝ , ΝΑΞΙΟΝ , ΝΑΞΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 160 ; SNG Cop. Sicily 493 ). The last issue of 403 has obv . Apollo or Silenos, legend: ΝΕΟΠΟΛΙ ; rev . river-god Assinos on the smaller denominations (Head, HN ² 160 -61 ; SNG Cop . Sicily 495 -96 ). Bronze coinage was introduced c. 410 (Rutter ( 1997 ) 152 ). Naxos became the metropolis of Leontinoi (no. 33 ) and Katane (no. 30 ) shortly after its own foundation (Thuc. 6 . 3 . 3 ); other sources list also Kallipolis (no. 27 ; Strabo 6 . 2 . 6 ) and even Zankle (no. 51 ; Ps.-Skymnos 286 )."

The toponym is Σελινόεις , ηasper ( IvO 22 . 9 (C6l)); Σελινουtildeς (Hdt. 5 . 46 . 2 ; Thuc. 6 . 4 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is Σελινόντιος (C6l coins; IGDS no. 78 ( c. 450 )); Σελινουacuteντιος (Thuc. 7 . 58 . 1 ); Σελινουacuteσιος (Hdt. 5 . 46 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 10 ); or Σελινυacuteσιος ( CID ii 4 . i . 46 ( 361 / 60 )). Selinous is called a polis in the urban sense by Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 37 and is listed by Ps.-Skylax 13 under the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε ; it is referred to as a polis in the political sense at Thuc. 6 . 20 . 2 -3 and 6 . 48 . 1 . A C6l legal text from Olympia dealing with exiles from Megara (no. 36 ; IvO 22 ; IGDS no. 28 ) in fr. f. 3 refers to αasper πό [ λι ] ς ; according to Asheri ( 1979 b ), the inscription records a treaty between the polis of Selinous and a group of exiles from Megara; however, the fragmentary state of the inscription does not allow us to determine whether the reference is to Megara or to Selinous. A C5m lex sacra refers to ταgrave h ιαραgrave ταgrave δα µ όσια (A. 18 ) and τ ˜ οι βο µ˜ οι τ ˜ οι δα µ ασίοι (B. 10 ; Jameson et al . ( 1993 )). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested on C5m coins ( infra ) and in IGDS no. 78 ( c. 450 ; Arena ( 1989 ) no. 53 ); the external collective use is attested in Diod. 5 . 9 . 2 (rC6f), Hdt. 5 . 46 . 2 , Thuc. 6 . 20 . 4 and Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 10 . The external individual use is found in IGDS no. 67 (C6l), IG XII. 5 444 . 65 . 79 b (C3f (rC5l)), and F.Delphes iii . 1 391 . 2 ( c. 360 ). According to Thuc. 6 . 4 . 2 , Selinous was founded 100 years after the foundation of its metropolis Megara, i.e. c. 628 / 7 . The oecist Pammilos was possibly from the original mother city, Megara Nisaia (no. 225 ), although the text is ambiguous (cf. HCT ad loc . and Casevitz ( 1985 ) 105 , 109 n. 27 ), and a Megara Hyblaian origin cannot be excluded. Diod. 13 . 59 . 4 supports the Eusebian date for the foundation of Selinous: 242 years before its destruction in 409 / 8 , i.e. c. 651 / 50 (source: Bérard ( 1957 ) 244 -46 ). Diodorus' date is consistent with the chronology of the recently excavated Buffa and Manuzza cemeteries (Tusa ( 1982 ) 191 -94 ; Rallo ( 1982 )). Selinous was the westernmost Greek colony on the south coast of Sicily, founded on the confines of Phoenician and Elymian territories. The size of Selinous' territory varied, and borders changed (see La Genière ( 1978 )). The C7l immediate hinterland may have comprised 300 -400 km ² . A sanctuary of Herakles near the Heled Elymian settlement at Monte Castellazzo di Poggioreale, c. 30 km north of Selinous, is deduced from the C6e dedication to Herakles by one Aristylos in the Selinountian alphabet and in Doric dialect ( IGDS no. 84 ; Falsone ( 1992 ) 307 -8 ); stone quarries in the catchment area of Selinous served the early building programmes in the sanctuaries of the colony (PeschlowBindokat ( 1990 )). With the foundation of Minoa in C6f/m ( infra ) the area within Selinountian influence may have encompassed c. 1 , 200 -1 , 800 km ² , and there is clear evidence of Selinountine architects at work by C6 in the Contrada Mango sanctuary at Segesta (Tusa ( 1961 ); de La Genière ( 1978 )). The original, indigenous settlement of Monte Adranone, situated on the western border of Selinountine territory, c. 30 km north-west of Selinous, resettled by Selinountines in C6m,served as a fortified outpost until C5l (Fiorentini ( 1995 )). The site is perhaps the kome Adranon mentioned by Diod. ( 23 . 4 . 2 ) in connection with the Punic wars, not to be confused with the Adranon (no. 6 ) founded by Dionysios. After initial peaceful co-existence (Tusa ( 1983 ) 302 -14 ; Zahrnt ( 1993 ) 355 -57 ), a long history of conflicts with the non-Greek populations can be traced: an alliance of Selinous and a colonising expedition led by Pentathlos of Knidos ( c. 580 -576 ) was defeated by the Elymians (Diod. 5 . 9 . 2 -3 ), and conflicts between Greeks, Elymians and Phoenicians are also reflected in the failed expedition of Dorieus in 510 (Hdt. 5 . 46 . 1 ), if not already by the C6 inscription commemorating Aristogeiton,who fell at Motya ( IGDS no. 73 ; Mafoda ( 1995 )). In 480 , however, Selinous was the only Greek city of Sicily supporting Carthage against Theron of Akragas and Gelon of Syracuse (Diod. 11 . 21 . 4 -5 , 13 . 55 . 1 ). In 466 , Selinous assisted Syracuse in expelling the tyrant Thrasyboulos (Diod. 11 . 68 . 1 ). A victory of uncertain date is mentioned in the 460 -409 inscription ( IGDS no. 78 ) from temple 'G' ( infra ) revealing conflicts c. C5m with Elymians and/or Phoenicians. Not all relations with the non-Greek populations were hostile, however, and there may have been epigamia between Selinous and Segesta (Thuc. 6 . 1 . 2 with HCT ). In 416 the conflict with Segesta ( supra ) led Selinous to ally itself with Syracuse (Thuc. 6 . 6 . 2 ), and accordingly it supported Syracuse in its war with Athens (Thuc. 6 . 65 . 1 , 67 . 2 , 7 . 58 . 1 ; cf. Diod. 13 . 4 . 2 (r 415 )). The territorial disputes between Segesta and Selinous in 416 (Thuc. 6 . 6 . 2 ; Diod. 12 . 82 . 3 ) and 410 (Diod. 13 . 43 . 1 -4 ) ultimately led to the destruction of Selinous in 409 by Carthage (Diod. 13 . 55 -57 ), when the houses were burnt or torn down, 16 , 000 were killed, 5 , 000 taken prisoners, and 2 , 600 escaped to Akragas (no. 9 ; Diod. 13 . 57 . 6 -58 . 3 ). The city was recaptured and fortified by Hermokrates, who also laid waste the territories of Motya and Panormos (Diod. 13 . 62 . 3 -5 (r 409 )). As an outcome of adversities suffered by the Carthaginians, Himilcar was forced to sign a peace treaty with Dionysios I in 405 , in which, however, it was stipulated that Selinous (and several other cities) were to be unfortified and pay tribute to Carthage (Diod. 13 . 114 . 1 ; Staatsverträge no. 210 ).Yet conflicts between the Greek cities and Carthage continued, and Dionysios, with Selinous and Himera (no. 24 ), attacked Motya in 397 (Diod. 14 . 47 . 7 ), which implies that, in addition to the eastern Sicilian cities, Himera and Selinous had also come within Dionysios'hegemony.A second peace treaty of 392 was in most matters similar to that of 405 (Diod. 14 . 96 . 3 ; Staatsverträge no. 233 ). It seems, however, that Selinous (and the other cities subjected to Carthage by the previous treaty) were now handed over to Dionysios I (see Stylianou ( 1998 ) 207 ). In a peace treaty of c. 374 Selinous, its territory, and Akragas were again ceded to the Carthaginians (Diod. 15 . 17 . 5 with Stylianou ( 1998 ) ad loc .; Staatsverträge no. 261 ). Selinous was recaptured by Dionysios in 368 , but an armistice was agreed and the old borders were reestablished (Diod. 15 . 73 . 2 -4 ), and when Dion visited Herakleia Minoa (west of Selinous) in 357 , this city was controlled by Carthage (Diod 16 . 9 . 4 ). In the 339 treaty between Timoleon and Carthage, Selinous was left within the Carthaginian sphere of interest (Diod. 16 . 82 . 3 ; Staatsverträge no. 344 ; cf. T albert ( 1974 ) 83 -85 ), and this was confirmed by the treaty between Agathokles and Carthage in 314 (Diod. 19 . 71 . 7 ). A few scattered sources shed some light on the military strength of Selinous and the size of its population.A contingent of hoplites from Selinous fought alongside the Syracusans in 415 (Thuc. 6 . 67 . 2 ); later, Selinountine psiloi and hippeis marched to Syracuse under the command of Gylippos (Thuc. 7 . 1 . 3 -5 ; cf. Diod. 13 . 4 . 7 (r 414 )); hippeis are mentioned also in Diod. 11 . 21 . 4 (r 480 ). A navy is implied by Thucydides' reference to two nees . . . Selinountiai at 8 . 26 . 1 (cf. Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 8 for another two). In reference to 410 , Diod. 13 . 44 . 3 describes Selinous as a polis polyandrousa , and a hint of the C5l size of population is found in the figures of 16 , 000 inhabitants killed and 5 , 000 captives taken by the Carthaginians in 409 (Diod. 13 . 57 . 6 ); this had already been preceded by the loss of 1 , 000 men in an ambush (Diod. 13 . 44 . 4 (r 410 )). Even so, 2 , 600 escaped to Akragas (Diod. 13 . 58 . 3 ). A full mobilisation of forces is mentioned in Diod. 14 . 47 . 7 (r 397 ). Diplomatic activities include the reception of envoys (Diod. 11 . 68 . 1 (r 466 )) as well as the sending of envoys (Diod. 11 . 21 . 4 (r 480 ), bibliaphoroi , cf. 13 . 54 . 3 (r 409 ), 13 . 43 . 7 , 44 . 4 (r 409 )). F.Delphes iii . 1 391 ( c. 360 -355 ) is a grant of various privileges by Delphi (no. 177 ) to a man of Selinous. A grant of politeia to Selinountians by Ephesos (no. 844 ) is recorded by Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 10 ; it was prompted by the destruction of the city. What we know about the constitution indicates that Selinous was mostly governed by tyrants, at least in the Archaic period. Tyranny is attested in connection with the C6l expedition of Dorieus,whose συγκτίστης Euryleon liberated the Selinountians from the mounarchos Pythagoras but went on to assume monarchical power himself (Hdt. 5 . 46 . 2 ; cf. Luraghi ( 1994 ) 54 -55 ; Mafoda ( 1995 )). An earlier tyranny at Selinous (C6m or C6f) may be suggested by the anecdote of 'Theron, son of Miltiades'assuming tyrannical power by a stratagem (Polyaen. 1 . 28 . 2 ; full discussion: Luraghi ( 1994 ) 52 -54 ). The αισι µ νάτας of IvO 22 ( IGDS no. 28 (C6l)) refers to a magistracy attested also in Megara Nisaia (no. 225 ) and other Megarian colonies (Dubois ad IGDS no. 28 fr.b. 5 -6 with refs.); however, the context does not make clear whether the reference is to Selinous or to Megara (for the office in general, see Asheri ( 1979 b ) 490 ). The text may mention a halia : h α ] λία διαίτεσ [ ε (see Arena ( 1989 ) no. 52 fr. h. 4 ; Asheri ( 1979 b )). Whether this Selinountine(?) halia should be interpreted as an ekklesia or a special court is uncertain; Asheri opts for an ad hoc tribunal (Asheri ( 1979 b ) 490 ). Two C5 public enactments are preserved: a lex sacra of C5m (Jameson et al . ( 1993 )) and IGDS no. 78 = IG xiv 268 (C5m/s), which lists Selinountine divinities and incorporates a decree. A metoikos at Selinous is mentioned by Callim. fr. 201 (Pfeiffer) Dieg . ix . 15 -16 (referring to the period before Timaios wrote, cf. FGrHist 566 , fr. 148 ). A C6 -C5 dedicatory inscription attests the existence of a πατριά whose members are given as two groups of women (Lazzarini no. 880 e; cf. Jameson et al . ( 1993 ) 90 ); it is not clear whether this was a public or a private institution. A C5f dedication by the citizens of Selinous and the metopes of Temple C testify to the Selinountian pantheon in which the principal divinity seems to be Zeus ( IG xiv 268 ; SEG 38 960 ; SEG 43 628 ; IGDS no. 78 ; see also Jameson et al . ( 1993 )). Selinous had a thesauros at Olympia (Paus. 6 . 19 . 11 (rC5 )). The foundation of the building has with some probability been identified, and C5e architectural terracottas have with some uncertainty been associated with it (Mertens-Horn and Viola ( 1990 ) 240 ). The town of Selinous was founded on a vast plateau, c. 1 . 3 km long, oriented roughly north-south between the ancient river Selinous, from which the city took its name (Douris ( FGrHist 76 ) fr. 59 ), to the west, and the river Cotone to the east. The site comprises three hills separated by the river valleys, the city occupying the central plateau, while the two lateral plateaux, the Gaggera to the west and the Marinella to the east, were dedicated to sanctuaries (Martin et al . ( 1979 ) 637 -53 ; cf. Parisi Presicce ( 1984 ) fig. 2 and 127 -32 for topographical surveys). The southern plateau, facing the coast and often regarded as the acropolis of the city, owes its acropolis-like appearance to an artificial accentuation of the morphology of the site due to C4l and C3l defensive structures (Di Vita ( 1980 )). C7m/s habitation remains on the northern, Manuzza plateau (Rallo ( 1976 -1977 ), ( 1984 )) and on the 'acropolis' (Fourmont ( 1984 -85 )) have revealed an overall coherence in the urbanisation of the two areas. Unusually, a cemetery is situated within the urban area on the Manuzza. A large part of the 'acropolis'was laid out as a temenos from C7 . There is also coherence between the three major plateaux of the site from C7 : the Manuzza plateau and 'acropolis' ,the Marinella plateau east of the river Hypsas with a C7shrine (Gullini ( 1993 )), and the Gaggera plateau west of the river Selinous with the Malophoros sanctuary and the C7l megaron (Romeo ( 1989 ) 40 , no. 64 ). The main east-west axis on the 'acropolis'joined the estuaries of the two rivers and the harbours of Selinous, the eastern harbour possibly military, the western harbour possibly commercial. In the second urban phase, from c. C6e, the habitation area and urban layout encompassed also the east and west slopes of the central plateau with parts of the confining valleys (de La Genière and Rougetet ( 1985 ); Mertens ( 1999 ) 188 -90 ). Habitation on the northernmost part of the Manuzza plateau was laid out on a different orientation to that employed on the 'acropolis' and on the southern part of Manuzza plateau, and an agora at the junction of these separate urban districts is similar to the location of the agora at Megara (Mertens ( 1999 ) 190 -93 ). Rallo ( 1976 -77 ) 731 has suggested that the differences in orientation could reflect different populations, and a Corinthian ethnic group has been deduced from epigraphic and tomb evidence (cf. de La Genière ( 1977 ) 257 ; IGDS nos. 72 and 79 ). The C6 -C5 urban area comprised about 100 ha (Mertens ( 1989 ) fig. 4 , ( 1999 ) fig. on p. 188 ). A theatre, possibly serving as the meeting place for the assembly, is mentioned in Callim. fr. 201 , Pfeiffer, Dieg . ix . 22 -23 (referring to the period before Timaios wrote, cf. FGrHist 566 , fr. 148 ). So far none of the defensive walls of the 'acropolis'can be dated earlier than the C5l Hermokratean structures of 409 , when the Syracusan exiles seized Selinous for a short period in connection with the Carthaginian war (Diod. 13 . 63 . 3 -4 ; ibid. 185 -86 ). By contrast, the outer circuit wall and gates in the Hypsas valley,marking the eastern limit of the city,are of C6f and C5e (Mertens ( 1989 ) 138 -39 ). A circuit wall across the Manuzza plain was probably raised by Hermokrates in 409 (ibid. 139 -43 ). The sophisticated fortification and gate system on the north side of the acropolis, comparable with the Euryalos fortification at Syracuse, may in its final phase be the work of Agathokles during his short occupation of Selinous in 307 (Diod. 20 . 56 . 3 ; cf. Lawrence ( 1979 ) 295 ; Mertens ( 1989 ) 110 -31 , 151 ). The central and south-eastern part of the 'acropolis'was from early on occupied by at least two temene (Gabrici ( 1929 )); the south temenos with two parallel temples of C5f, 'O' and 'A' (divinities unknown). The central temenos has traces of simple C7l-C6e naiskoi . There is no structural evidence for a major C6 peripteral temple, but architectural terracottas are taken as evidence for one. As part of the C6f regular urban plan, the sanctuary was enclosed by peribolos walls from 580 to 560 (Østby ( 1995 )).A large artificial terrace supported by a huge, stepped retaining wall of ashlar masonry on the east slope of the acropolis, dated prior to C6m, permitted an enlargement of the temenos and the erection of new buildings: temple 'C' (date controversial: before C6m or c. 530 -520 ) replaced the earlier, conjectural temple, with an altar to the east and a monumental stoa on top of the retaining wall marking the east side of the temenos (Di Vita ( 1967 ), ( 1984 )). Architectural fragments and sculpture reused in the later fortifications are from an otherwise unknown sanctuary, possibly near the agora (Mertens ( 1999 )). The temenos was enlarged in C5e to make room for the monumental temple 'D' . On the basis of epigraphic evidence, above all the inscription ( IGDS no. 78 ) from temple 'G'( infra ), temple 'C' , with its predecessor, is attributed to Apollo (Bejor ( 1977 ) 449 ; IGDS no. 51 ). The dedicatees of the c. 480 -450 temples 'A' , 'O' and 'D' are more uncertain. Three monumental temples,'E' ,'F' and 'G' , were aligned on the Marinella hill east of the Hypsas valley (Berve and Gruben ( 1963 ) 426 -32 ; Gullini ( 1993 )). Temple 'G' (C6l, not completed) is among the most monumental of antiquity; the inscription from the adyton mentions a victory, a number of divinities, and a dedication to these in gold to the value of 60 tal. put up εις τοgrave Απολλόνιον (Calder ( 1963 ), ( 1964 ); IGDS no. 78 ). The occasion of the victory is unknown, but historical and epigraphical evidence dates the inscription between 460 and 409 (Calder ( 1963 ) 54 -62 ). The temple is often interpreted as the Apolloneion mentioned in the inscription, but the evidence is inconclusive, and the identification of the temple as an Olympieion has won support (Tusa ( 1967 ); Bejor ( 1977 ); infra ). The cult of the C6m temple 'F' is unknown, but the closed peristasis may indicate a mystery cult,e.g.of Dionysos or Demeter. Temple 'E' , of C7l-C5m, has been identified as a Heraion ( IGDS no. 56 ). At least four sanctuaries were located on the Gaggera hill west of the river Selinous (Gabrici ( 1927 ); Tusa et al . ( 1984 -85 ) 574 -81 ). The major sanctuary of Demeter Malophoros ( IGDS no. 54 ), located near the coast and harbour, had an initial phase in C7l-C6e and a monumental aspect established by C6s with a temple, a monumental altar and a peribolos wall, later embellished with a C5l propylon . The votive material is immensely rich (Gabrici ( 1927 ); recent surveys: Dewailly ( 1992 ) 1 -36 and Hinz ( 1998 ) 144 -52 ). The cult of the adjacent C6m temenos was that of Hekate ( IGDS no. 55 ). To the north, a sanctuary of Zeus Meilichios bordered on that of Demeter (Gabrici ( 1927 ) 91 -107 ; Tusa ( 1977 )), with a cult that is characterised by a number of C6s-C5 crude and simple stone stelai carrying votive inscriptions (earliest C6m: IGDS nos. 45 , 50 ; Jameson et al . ( 1993 ) 89 -107 , 132 -36 ) and by later defixiones ( IGDS nos. 35 , 39 , 40 ). T o the south, a peribolos wall, parallel to that of the Demeter sanctuary, enclosed yet another temenos and temple of uncertain cult (Parisi Presicce ( 1984 ) 21 -24 ). A C6 temple 'M' marks the north end of the row of sanctuaries (Sguaitammati ( 1993 )). The inscription from temple 'G'( IGDS no. 78 ) mentions Zeus, Phobos, Herakles, Apollo, Poseidon, the Tyndaridai, Athena, (Demeter) Malophoros and Pasikrateia (Persephone?). The second part of the dedication, the decree, mentions an Apolloneion and Zeus (Calder ( 1963 ); IGDS no. 78 ). A cult of Zeus Agoraios is revealed by the episode of Euryleon seeking refuge at the altar of Zeus Agoraios (Hdt. 5 . 46 . 2 ). Coin types suggest cults of Artemis and Apollo, and the river-gods Selinous and Hypsas. The earliest cemetery is the one situated in the south-east of the Manuzza plateau dating from before C7m and in use throughout C7 , the early material reflecting the Megarian origin of Selinous (Rallo ( 1982 )). Contemporaneously and in subsequent periods cemeteries were laid out on the hills surrounding the urban site: C7m on the Buffa hills northeast of the Manuzza plateau (Tusa ( 1982 ) 196 -202 ); C6e and C5 , mainly inhumation tombs, some cremation and a few child enchytrismos burials on the Gaggera hills west of the Manuzza plateau,and C7s tombs on the Galera hills north of the Manuzza plateau (Vallet and Villard ( 1958 )). Selinous was one of the first Sicilian cities to issue coins, c. 540 -530 : staters probably initially on the Corinthian standard but at the end of the Archaic phase on the Attic. Types: obv . celery leaf ( σέλινον ); rev . patterned punch-mark in incuse square ( SNG Cop. Sicily 591 -93 ; SNG Cop. Suppl . 73 ). Later issues have rev . celery leaf in incuse square, legend: ΣΕΛΙ with variations ( SNG Cop. Sicily 594 ). Three smaller fractions carry rev . celery leaf, or flower, or pellets (Cutroni Tusa ( 1975 ); C. Boehringer ( 1984 -85 ) 116 -19 ; SNG Cop.Sicily 595 -96 ). A unique drachm carries the unabbreviated city-ethnic as legend (Cutroni Tusa ( 1988 -89 ) 370 -71 ). Confirmation of Corinthian influence on early Sicilian coinage and imports of bullion from the Aegean area is given by a C6l coin and bullion hoard found near Selinous (ibid. ( 1988 -89 ) 397 -98 ). Minting of Syracuse-inspired tetradrachms began c. 450 : obv . sacred chariot with Apollo and Artemis, legend: ΣΕΛΙΝΟΝΤΙΟΝ ; rev . naked youth, the river-god Selinous, offering a libation at an altar in a sanctuary, l. below cock, on r. celery leaf and statue of bull, legend: ΣΕΛΙΝΟΣ ( SNG Cop. Sicily 597 ). The types of the lower denomination (didrachms) are: obv . Herakles fighting Cretan bull, legend: ΣΕΛΙΝΟΝΤΙΟΝ ; rev . river-god Hypsas,legend: ΗΥΨΑΣ ( SNG Cop.Sicily 601 ); on smaller denominations, obv . nymph seated on rock ( SNG Cop.Sicily 602 -3 ). The issues continue with variants until 409 ( SNG Cop. Sicily 604 -6 ). Bronze coinage was issued at least from c. 420 (Price ( 1979 ); Rutter ( 1997 ) 142 ); however, an issue of cast coins may go back to 450 -440 (Cutroni Tusa ( 1997 -98 ) 646 -47 ). Selinous founded the colony of (Herakleia) Minoa (no. 20 ) (Hdt. 5 . 46 . 2 ) on the estuary of the river Platani c. C6f/m to secure its eastern territory against Akragantine expansion, but after the short-lived rule of Euryleon, the colony was taken by Akragas (no. 9 ); during Theron's reign ( 488 -473 ) it seems to have been a city within Akragantine dominion, possibly after conquest by Theron (cf. Diod. 4 . 79 . 4 with Fontana ( 1978 ); see further Herakleia (no. 20 ))."

The Stielanaioi struck coins from c. 460 onwards; they may have been based at the Στυacuteελλα of Steph.

The Stielanaioi are included here on account of their Greek-style coinage: this coinage began with an issue of silver litrai c. 460 : obv . forepart of man-headed bull, legend: ΣΤΙΕΛΑΝΑΙΟ ( Ν ) (retrograde); rev . male figure (river-god?) sacrificing at altar. Later issues (drachms and lower denominations): obv . male head laureate (river-god or, perhaps more likely, Apollo); rev . forepart of man-headed bull, legend: ΣΤΙΑ (Head, HN ² 171 ; Bernabò Brea ( 1975 ) 49 -51 ; Holloway ( 1975 ) 142 -43 ; Manganaro ( 1984 ) 35 -36 ; survey of find-places: Cutroni Tusa ( 1997 -98 ) 630 ; cf. AIIN 42 ( 1995 ) pl. 26 , fig. 2 ). The types reveal strong influence from the contemporary mints of Katane and Leontinoi. The Stielanaioi are considered a Greek community by Mirone ( 1928 ), followed by Ziegler ( 1940 ), founded C5e in the hinterland of Katane (no. 30 ) and Leontinoi (no. 33 ) in the aftermath of the Deinomenid aggression against these cities."

Ep . 5 . 104 have Συρακόσσαι ; Συράκοσαι is found at Pind. Pyth . 2 . 1 . The city-ethnic is Συρακόσιος (C5 coins, infra ; Thuc. 3 . 103 . 1 ; IGDS no. 94 ( 474 )) and Συρηκόσιος (Hdt. 7 . 155 . 2 ). Also spelled Συρα/Koppaόσιος (C6l-C5e coins, infra ; IGDS no. 93 ( c. 480 ); cf. IG v . 1 217 (C5e): [ Συρ ] α/Koppaουσίον ). Syracuse is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 7 . 155 . 2 ; Thuc. 6 . 65 . 3 ; Ps.-Skylax 13 ) and in the political sense (Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 ; Thuc. 6 . 36 . 2 and Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 28 ). Its politeia was described by Aristotle (Arist. fr. 602 . 1 ). Politeuesthai is found at Arist. Pol . 1312 b 9 , polites at Arist. Pol . 1303 a 38 , politeuma at Arist. Pol . 1303 b 26 , damosios at SEG 38 368 ( c. 475 ), and demos at Thuc. 6 . 35 . 1 . Astoi referring to the citizens is found at Pind. Pyth . 3 . 71 and asty referring to the city occurs in AG 13 . 15 (C4e). For Patris , see Thuc. 6 . 68 . 8 ; 69 . 3 and Isoc. 3 . 23 . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested on coins from C6l onwards ( infra ); the external collective use is found in IvO 661 (C6 ), IGDS no. 89 ( 485 -470 ), Hdt. 3 . 125 . 2 and Thuc. 3 . 103 . 1 . The external individual use is attested in Egypt-Delta i 694 / 511 (C6 -C5 ), IvO 266 ( c. 480 ), Thuc. 4 . 58 , IG ii² 101 . 2 ( 372 / 1 ) and CID ii 4 . i . 40 ( 360 ). Syracuse was founded by Archias, a Heraklid from Corinth (no. 227 ; Thuc. 6 . 3 . 2 ; cf. Strabo 8 . 6 . 22 ). According to Strabo 6 . 2 . 4 and Ps.-Skymnos 279 -82 the founders included a group of Dorians who had come to found Megara (no. 36 ) but fell out with the other colonists and then joined the Corinthian founders of Syracuse. The exact date of the foundation, as well as its date relative to those of the other early colonies in Sicily, is much debated: according to Thuc. 6 . 3 . 1 (probably based on Antiochos of Syracuse),the city was founded only a year after Naxos, the earliest of the Sicilian colonies. On the other hand, Ephor. fr. 137 a ( apud Strabo 6 . 2 . 2 ) stated that Naxos (no. 41 ) and Megara (no. 36 ) were the earliest colonies, and the unemended text of Strabo 6 . 2 . 4 presupposes that Megara was founded shortly before Syracuse.Thuc. 6 . 3 . 2 gives the foundation date as 733 / 2 (supported by Eusebios, cf. Bérard ( 1957 ) 120 with refs.). However, a date c. C8m is indicated by Marmor Parium ( FGrHist 239 ) A 31 , which places Archias seven generations after Temenos and the return of the Herakleidai. The name of the territory was ηasper Συρακοσία (Thuc. 6 . 52 . 2 ); it is termed γηtilde at Thuc. 7 . 42 . 6 and χώρα at 6 . 45 . After its foundation, Syracuse quickly expanded its territory; by C8l it extended as far to the south-west as Heloron (no. 18 ), a Syracusan colony founded in C8l-C7e; by 664 it extended inland as far as Akrai (no. 10 ), a colony founded in that year (Thuc. 6 . 5 . 2 ); by C7s it had expanded further westwards to Kasmenai (no. 29 ), a colony founded in 644 (Thuc. 6 . 5 . 3 ). To the north, Thapsos formed the border with Megara (no. 36 ); Kamarina (no. 28 ) was founded in 598 on the border between the areas of influence of Syracuse and Gela (Di Vita ( 1956 ), ( 1987 )). Heloron, Akrai and Kasmenai were possibly constituted as dependent poleis in the territory of Syracuse (see the respective entries); Kamarina was also in one way or another dependent on Syracuse. Herodotos reports that Kamarina of old belonged to Syracuse ( 7 . 154 . 3 ), and Thucydides refers to a C6m apostasis from Syracuse by Kamarina ( 6 . 5 . 3 ). The C7 -C6Syracusan dominion comprised an area of about 3 , 000 -3 , 500 km ² . During the C5f rule of the Deinomenidai, Syracuse incorporated or exercised influence over the territories of Kamarina, Megara, Leontinoi and Naxos; by 440 all native communities were ruled by Syracuse (Diod. 12 . 29 . 2 -4 ); after Dionysios I's peace with Carthage in 392 , Syracuse ruled over all of central and eastern Sicily (Karlsson ( 1992 ) map 2 .a), and over parts of South Italy including Rhegion (no. 68 ) and southern Calabria. The size of the population is unknown, and it must have been subject to constant changes due to the many relocations carried out during the Classical period. The known incorporations of foreign groups into the Syracusan citizen body are the following: ( 1 ) Gelon transplanted and granted Syracusan citizenship to (a) all the Kamarinaians, (b) half of the Geloans,(c) the pachees of Megara,(d) the pachees of the city of Euboia (Hdt. 7 . 156 . 2 -3 ); (e) he also granted citizenship to more than 10 , 000 mercenaries (Diod. 11 . 72 . 3 ). ( 2 ) After the congress in Gela in 424 , the dynatoi of Leontinoi were relocated to Syracuse and were granted citizenship (Thuc. 5 . 4 . 2 ; cf. Xen. Hell . 2 . 3 . 5 ). ( 3 ) Dionysios I enlarged the citizen body by enrolling (a) eleutheromenoi as neopolitai (Diod. 14 . 7 . 4 ); (b) the inhabitants of Leontinoi, who were granted citizenship (Diod. 14 . 15 . 4 ); (c) the inhabitants of Italian Kaulonia, who were granted citizenship and ateleia for five years (Diod. 14 . 106 . 3 ); (d) the inhabitants of Italian Hipponion (though it is not specified at Diod. 14 . 107 . 2 that these received citizenship). ( 4 ) Timoleon (a) made the people of Agyrion (and possibly Kentoripa) citizens of Syracuse (Diod. 16 . 82 . 4 ); (b) relocated the population of Leontinoi to Syracuse (and presumably granted them citizenship, though this is not specified at Diod. 16 . 82 . 7 ); (c) settled 5 , 000 new colonists (Diod. 16 . 82 . 3 ; cf. Plut. Tim . 23 ); and (d) later several myriads more ( 40 , 000 according to Diod. 16 . 82 . 5 ; perhaps 60 , 000 according to Athanis ( FGrHist 562 ) fr. 2 ; cf. Talbert ( 1974 ) 30 ). In the Classical period, Syracuse was the largest city of Sicily (Hecat. fr. 74 ; Thuc. 7 . 58 . 4 ), in extent second only to Akragas,for which city Diod. 13 . 84 . 3 (r 406 ) gives the figure of 20 , 000 citizens. Drögemüller ( 1969 ) 100 suggests an urban population of 40 , 000 -45 , 000 for Syracuse, a guesstimate which may be a little on the high side in view of the size of the C5 habitation area, c. 150 ha ( infra ). It is impossible to estimate the number of citizens from the few hints given by Thucydides about the size of the Syracusan army in 415 ( 6 . 67 . 2 : πανδη µ εί , number of cavalry given as 1 , 200 ). Treaties of C6m with Megara, Enna (Kasmenai? cf. the entry for Kasmenai) and presumably Gela are strongly implied by Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 5 , who refers to a war between Syracuse and Kamarina and their allies. In 492 a treaty with Hippokrates of Gela after his defeat of the Syracusans came about through arbitration by Corinth (no. 227 ) and Korkyra (no. 123 ) (Hdt. 7 . 154 . 3 ; cf. Thuc. 6 . 5 . 3 ). Gelon's victory at Himera induced nearly all the cities of Sicily to recognise his power and to enter into a symmachia with him (Diod. 11 . 26 . 2 ). Syracuse was a party to the panSicilian agreement concluded at the Congress of Gela in 424 by which it ceded Morgantina (no. 37 ) to Kamarina (no. 28 ) in return for a specified payment (Thuc. 4 . 65 . 1 ). During the war with Leontinoi (no. 33 ) in the 420 s, Syracuse had treaties of symmachia with the Dorian cities of Sicily (except for Kamarina) and with Italian Lokroi (no. 59 ; Thuc. 3 . 86 . 2 -3 ) and Lipara (no. 34 ) (Thuc. 3 . 88 . 3 ), and it ruled a number of Sikel communities kata kratos ( 103 . 1 ), receiving aparche from them (Thuc. 6 . 20 . 4 ). Numerous Syracusan exiles are on record; the earliest are the Myletidai mentioned at Thuc. 6 . 5 . 1 who joined the Zanklaians (no. 51 ) in founding Himera (no. 24 ) in 648 . Exiles are attested under Deinomenid rule (Diod. 11 . 67 . 5 ), and in C5m several sentences of exile were decreed by petalismos (Diod. 11 . 87 . 4 (rC5m)). Exiles collaborated with the Athenians during their attack (Thuc. 6 . 64 . 1 ). A collective sentence of exile was passed on the strategoi after the battle of Kyzikos (Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 27 ). In 406 a general recall of exiles was voted by the assembly (Diod. 13 . 92 . 4 -7 ). The city waged numerous wars; the earliest known is the C6m war with its colony Kamarina in which both were supported by allies (Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 5 ).Apart from the military victories of the Deinomenidai, the most spec- tacular triumph was that of the democracy which,eventually joined by all Sicilian poleis except Akragas (no. 9 ) (Thuc. 7 . 33 , 58 ), defeated the invading Athenians (Thuc. 6 -7 ). The Deinomenidai raised huge armies,but these can hardly have been recruited from Syracuse alone, and Deinomenid employment of mercenaries was extensive (Parke ( 1933 ) 10 -13 ); in 480 Gelon raised 50 , 000 foot and 5 , 000 horse (Diod. 11 . 21 ); Thrasyboulos raised 15 , 000 soldiers (Diod. 11 . 67 . 7 (r 466 )) and controlled a navy (Diod. 11 . 68 . 3 (r 466 )). But even during Deinomenid rule there are references to civic forces proper (Diod. 11 . 67 . 5 : politikai dynameis ). In 471 , 2 , 000 Syracusans fell in battle against Akragas (Diod. 11 . 53 . 5 ). In 439 , the democracy had 100 triremes constructed (Diod. 12 . 30 . 1 ), and Thucydides twice refers to eighty ships in action ( 7 . 22 . 1 , 38 . 1 ). Trierarchoi are attested at Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 28 (cf. IG ii² 105 . 37 ( 368 / 7 )), naval commanders at Thuc. 7 . 25 . 1 , and a nauarchos at Diod. 11 . 88 . 4 (r 453 ). Navies are mentioned also at e.g. Thuc. 7 . 52 . 1 (seventy-six ships); Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 10 (twenty-five ships), and Diod. 13 . 13 . 1 (r 413 ) (seventy-four ships). Hoplites are mentioned at Thuc. 6 . 67 . 2 , ( pandemei , but no figure); a corps of 600 epilektoi is attested for 461 (Diod. 11 . 76 . 2 ; cf. Thuc. 6 . 96 . 3 for 600 logades hoplites) and 3 , 000 stratiotai epilektoi are attested for 409 (Diod. 13 . 59 . 1 ). Akontistai are attested at Thuc. 6 . 67 . 2 and psiloi at 6 . 52 . 2 , 7 . 78 . 3 . Hippeis are mentioned at e.g. Thuc. 6 . 67 . 2 , where they are said to number not less than 1 , 200 . The democracy too hired mercenaries (Thuc. 7 . 48 . 5 ). During the democracy the board of strategoi had fifteen members (five from each tribe?), but during the Athenian invasion it was reduced to three strategoi autokratores (Thuc. 6 . 73 . 1 ), perhaps one from each tribe. Strategoi are referred to also at e.g. Thuc. 6 . 40 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 27 ; IG ii² 105 . 36 ( 368 / 7 ); and Diod. 11 . 91 . 2 (r 451 ). Dionysios I in 405 raised 30 , 000 foot, 1 , 000 horse and 50 ships (Diod. 13 . 109 . 2 ). Sending of envoys is attested at Diod. 11 . 68 . 1 (r 466 ), Thuc. 4 . 58 (Congress of Gela), 73 . 2 , 75 . 2 ; reception of envoys is attested at Diod. 12 . 8 . 4 ( 446 ) and 13 . 44 . 4 (r 410 ). A grant of proxeny by Delphi (no. 177 ) to a citizen of Syracuse is recorded by F.Delphes iii . 1 437 ( 331 / 30 ); IG ii² 101 ( 373 / 2 ) is an honorific decree for a citizen of Syracuse by Athens (no. 361 ). The inhabitants of Antandros (no. 767 ) decreed honorific citizenship to the citizens of Syracuse in recognition of military help (Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 26 ). For block grants of Syracusan citizenship, see above.A citizen of Syracuse served as theorodokos of Epidauros (no. 348 ) in 356 / 5 ( IG iv² . 1 95 . i . 39 ; cf. ii . 61 ). The constitution of Syracuse is known almost exclusively from literary sources, and the only relevant inscriptions are a few dedications found in Olympia and Delphi ( infra ). Hippys of Rhegion ( FGrHist 554 ) fr. 4 refers to a Pollis Argeios describing him as having been king ( εβασίλευσε ) of Syracuse, presumably before C5 (Carlier ( 1984 ) 467 ; he is described as tyrannos in Arist. fr. 602 . 1 ). However, the original constitution of the city was an aristocracy of Gamoroi (Marmor Parium ( FGrHist 239 ) 36 (rC7l-C6e); cf. also IGDS no. 219 with Dubois'comm.; Diod. 8 . 11 ), who ruled both the demos (Hdt. 7 . 155 . 2 ) and a serf population called the Kyllyrioi (ibid. and Arist. fr. 603 ). In C5e the Gamoroi were expelled by the demos and retired to the Syracusan colony of Kasmenai (no. 29 ), whence they were brought back by Gelon, to whom the demos handed over both itself and the polis (see E. W. Robinson ( 1997 ) 120 -22 with Arist. Pol . 1302 b 31 -32 for democracy at Syracuse at this stage). Gelon moved his seat from Gela (no. 17 ) to Syracuse, and from that point the city was ruled by the tyrant dynasty of the Deinomenidai: Gelon ( 485 -478 / 7 ; see Berve ( 1967 ) 142 -47 ), Hieron ( 478 -466 ; see Berve ( 1967 ) 147 -52 ), and Thrasyboulos ( 466 / 5 ). The assembly is attested during Gelon's reign (Diod. 11 . 26 . 6 ). The tyranny was brought to an end in 466 / 5 , when the Syracusans revolted against Thrasyboulos (Arist. Pol . 1312 b 10 -16 ) and expelled him in collaboration with forces from Gela (no. 17 ), Akragas (no. 9 ), Selinous (no. 44 ) and Himera (no. 24 ) (Diod. 11 . 67 . 5 -68 . 5 ); Arist. Pol . 1312 a 10 -11 suggests that the Deinomenidai may have been weakened by internal rivalry. Democracy was now reintroduced (Arist. Pol . 1316 a 32 -33 ; Diod. 11 . 68 . 6 ), and at least some of the population relocations carried out by Gelon were reversed (Diod. 11 . 76 . 3 -5 ; Strabo 6 . 2 . 3 ). The assembly ( ekklesia ) passed a decree ( epsephisanto ) to the effect that only archaioi politai were entitled to hold office (Diod. 11 . 72 . 2 ). Seven thousand of the mercenaries enfranchised by Gelon were thus excluded from office (Diod. 11 . 73 . 1 ), though they remained citizens (Arist. Pol . 1303 b 1 ); this led to civil war (ibid.), which the mercenaries lost (Diod. 11 . 76 . 2 ; cf. Arist. Pol . 1303 a 38 ff). A koinon dogma by all the poleis of Sicily then reversed all population relocations of C5f and assigned Messana (no. 51 ) to the mercenaries (Diod. 11 . 76 . 5 (r 460 )). The democracy lasted until the tyranny of Dionysios I (for the democracy in this period, see Rutter ( 2000 )); during the democracy, the working of the assembly is attested (Thuc. 6 . 32 . 3 , 72 . 1 ; Diod. 11 . 72 , 92 . 2 ; cf. Thuc. 6 . 35 . 2 for a demou prostates and Diod. 11 . 92 . 2 (r 451 ) for a hint of the procedure of probouleusis (Rutter ( 2000 ) 145 )), and foreign policy was among its responsibilities (Thuc. 7 . 2 . 1 ); magistracies were originally filled by election (Diod. 11 . 73 . 1 ); Thuc. 6 . 38 . 5 suggests that a law specified a minimum age for office holding. The procedure of petalismos was instituted in imitation of Athenian ostracism to prevent the appearance of new tyrants; it led to several banishments, but had to be revoked because it alienated the upper class (Diod. 11 . 86 -87 ; Rutter ( 2000 ) 146 -48 ). After the victory over Athens the demos assumed still greater power (Arist. Pol . 1304 a 27 -29 : οasper δηtilde µ ος . . . εκ πολιτείας εις δη µ οκρατίαν µ ετέβαλε ).An important revision of the legislative code took place in this period ( 412 / 11 ) according to Diodorus: a commission of nomothetai presided over by Diokles drew up the so-called Laws of Diokles ( 13 . 35 ); one reform changed the procedure for appointing magistrates from election to sortition ( 13 . 34 . 6 ). Tyranny returned to Syracuse with Dionysios I, who ruled the city from his appointment as strategos autokrator in 406 (Diod. 13 . 95 . 1 ) to his death in 367 (see further Caven ( 1990 )). Dionysios presumably carried out a γηtildeς αναδασ µ ός to consolidate his grip on power (Diod. 14 . 7 . 4 -5 (r 404 )). IG ii² 105 . 35 -37 ( 368 / 7 ) suggests that in formal terms the democratic constitution remained in existence during Dionysios' reign (cf. Arist. Oec . 1349 a 14 , 26 , 34 for the ekklesia during his reign).After his death several tyrants were in power until the intervention of Timoleon in 344 put an end to a period of unrest and reintroduced democracy (see Talbert ( 1974 )). By the later C4 the city was ruled by 'the oligarchy of the Six Hundred' until tyranny returned once more with Agathokles (see Wickert in RE ² iv. 2 . 1518 -23 ). Syracuse experienced perhaps more staseis than any other Greek polis : Berger ( 1992 ) 34 -49 studies nineteen cases from the Archaic period down to the age of Timoleon. One stasis occurred prior to the foundation of Himera in 648 : Thuc. 6 . 5 . 1 mentions that a group of phygades from Syracuse στάσει νικηθέντες joined the Zanklaians in founding Himera (Berger ( 1992 ) 34 ). Another stasis occurred 'in ancient times' and developed from a conflict between office-holders into a conflict involving all citizens; it led to a change in the constitution (Arist. Pol . 1303 b 20 -26 ; cf. Berger ( 1992 ) 35 ). Plut. Mor . 825 C, relating this event, mentions a βουλή convened to solve the political differences. One of the earliest known public enactments is a law regulating funerary expenses which is attested during Gelon's reign (Diod. 11 . 38 . 2 ). A death sentence and execution are recorded by Diod. 11 . 91 . 2 (r 451 ); confiscation of property of convicts is attested by Diod. 13 . 93 . 2 (r 406 ). An eponymous epipolos is attested from the time of Timoleon onwards (Diod. 16 . 70 . 6 (r 344 )). Arist. Pol . 1303 b 23 has a general reference to archai 'in ancient times'; the boule is attested in the same period (by Plut. Mor . 825 C ( supra )) and is mentioned in IG ii² 105 . 36 ( 368 / 7 ). Thucydides provides some general references to officials ( 7 . 73 . 3 : οιasper εν τέλει όντες ; 7 . 73 . 4 : οιasper άρχοντες ); and Diod. 11 . 92 . 2 (r 451 ) has a general reference to archontes convening the assembly (cf. 13 . 91 . 4 (r 406 )). IG ii² 105 . 35 ( 368 / 7 ) also provides a general reference to archontes . A system of phylai is attested by Thuc. 6 . 100 . 1 ; it served inter alia as the basis for the army organisation (cf. Plut. Nic . 14 . 6 ). The number of strategoi indicates that there were three phylai ; they were presumably the traditional Dorian set of Hylleis, Dymanes and Pamphyloi (Jones, POAG 173 -76 ). A roster of all Syracusan citizens as organised into their phylai was stored in the Olympieion (Plut. Nic . 14 . 6 (r 415 ), see 229 ). Eisphora is attested during the reign of Dionysios I (Arist. Pol . 1313 b 26 ff, Oec . 1349 b 6 ); tribute received from subjected natives is attested in Thuc. 6 . 20 . 4 . According to Diod. 14 . 46 . 1 (r 398 ), a sizeable body of Carthaginians lived in Syracuse as free non-citizens. The splendidly celebrated Panhellenic victories of Hieron ( Olympionikai 221 , 234 , 246 ; Pind. Ol . 1 , Pyth . 1 -3 ; Bacchyl. Ep . 3 -5 ; cf. Harrell ( 2002 )) were not the only victories won by Syracusans; see Olympionikai 51 ( 648 ), 219 ( 476 ), 248 ( 468 ), and 334 ( 420 ). In C5f, Astylos of Kroton was proclaimed a Syrakosios at several of his Olympic victories ( Olympionikai 186 -87 ), and Diod. 11 . 1 . 2 describes him as such. Dikon of Kaulonia must have been among the Kaulonians relocated to Syracuse by Dionysios I ( supra ); he was proclaimed a Syrakosios at his subsequent victories ( Olympionikai 388 -89 ) and is described as such by Diod. 15 . 14 . 1 (cf. Stylianou ( 1998 ) ad loc .). For a C4l victor in the Arkadian Lykaia , see IG V. 2 550 . 20 . The principal divinities of Syracuse seem to have been Apollo, Artemis, Athena and Zeus (Olympios), to all of whom temples were erected in the Archaic period ( infra ). All preserved communal dedications are of C5 . IG v . 1 217 is presumably a C5f dedication by Syracuse at Sparta (no. 345 ). Whereas Gelon dedicated spoils from the battle of Himera ( 480 ) at Delphi in his own name (ML 28 = IGDS no. 93 ; cf. Diod. 11 . 26 . 7 ; for the structure: Krumeich ( 1991 )), spoils from the victory at Kyme in 474 were dedicated jointly at Olympia by Ηιάρον οasper ∆εινο µ ένεος καιgrave τοιgrave Συρακόσιοι (ML 29 = IGDS no. 94 ; cf. Horos 1 ( 1983 ) 59 ; Yalouris ( 1980 ) 14 -15 ; O. Hansen ( 1990 ); Harrell ( 2002 )). A treasury was built at Olympia from the spoils of Himera (Paus. 6 . 19 . 7 : οasper Καρχηδονίων θησαυρός ; for the structural remains: Mallwitz ( 1956 -58 )); in it were housed offerings by, presumably, 'Gelon and the Syracusans' (ibid.). For a dedication at Olympia by the Syracusans of spoils taken from Akragas,see IGDS no. 95 ; Y alouris ( 1980 ) 16 ; and SEG 11 1212 a (cf. SEG 15 252 ). A herald's staff was also dedicated at Olympia ( SEG 38 368 ( c. 475 )). At Delphi a treasury was constructed from the spoils taken from the defeated Athenians (Paus. 10 . 11 . 5 ). For attempts to identify both an Archaic and a Classical treasury of the Syracusans in the architectural remains at Delphi, see Partida ( 2000 ) 77 -80 , 135 -46 . The town was founded on the island of Ortygia, an ideal site with harbours on either side: in the east the Lakkios, the Small Harbour, in the west the Great Harbour (for a geomorphological survey of settlement and territory, see Mirisola and Polacco ( 1996 )). Traces of Sikel habitation confirm the tradition that the first Greek settlers ousted the original inhabitants (Thuc. 6 . 3 . 2 ; cf. Martin et al . ( 1979 ) 655 -57 ; Frasca ( 1983 )). Archaeological evidence confirms a C8s foundation date, and C8 habitation remains on Ortygia are similar to contemporary remains from Megara and Naxos.A north-south artery, joining the major sanctuaries, and with orthogonally laid out stenopoi , has an early origin (Pelagatti ( 1982 ) 135 -38 ; Voza ( 1984 -85 ) 669 -72 , ( 1993 -94 ) 1283 -87 ). The city expanded on to the mainland, the coastal plain of Achradina, from C8 (Voza ( 1976 -77 ) 551 -53 ), and from C7l-C6e a narrow isthmus may have joined Ortygia with its hinterland (cf. Strabo 1 . 3 . 18 ; Kapitän ( 1967 -68 )). The main east-west plateia of the Achradina originated in the C8 -C7 as a route linking Ortygia with the Fusco cemetery. There is C5 -C4evidence of orthogonal town planning (Voza ( 1976 -77 ) 551 -61 , ( 1980 -81 ) 681 -82 ). Ortygia and the inner Achradina comprised an area of c. 50 ha. The C4extension of the city northwards-obliterating the C7 -C4 cemeteries and joining the areas of the Achradina and Neapolis-is probably to be connected with the Timoleontic settlement of new colonists (Diod. 16 . 82 . 3 ). The periphery of the city was taken up with public buildings, and the outskirts of the Neapolis by theatres. Tyche, located to the east, with the sanctuary of Tyche and the upper plateau of Epipolai, were not urbanised; however, from the time of the conflict with Athens, the size of the city was about 150 ha, and in the Heltic period as much as 200 ha. The island of Ortygia and the coastal plain of Achradina were probably fortified during the Archaic period (implied by the mention of a siege by Hippokrates of Gela in the 490 s (Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 ) and by the mention of walls during the revolt against Thrasyboulos in 465 (Diod. 11 . 67 . 8 ; see also 11 . 73 . 1 )); however, the archaeological evidence is poor (Drögemüller ( 1969 ) 47 -48 , 55 -56 ). From the reign of Dionysios I, Ortygia served as a strongly fortified palace of the tyrants (Diod. 14 . 7 . 2 -4 ; cf. Hansen and Fischer-Hansen ( 1994 ) 29 ; for remains of a circuit wall, see Martin et al . ( 1979 ) 666 ; Karlsson ( 1992 ) 22 -23 ), a palace later razed to the ground by Timoleon (Diod. 16 . 70 . 4 ). The plateau of Epipolai was probably not fortified before forts were laid out there by the Athenians, and the various counter walls and cross walls were raised by the Syracusans during the war of 414 / 13 (Thuc. 6 . 99 -100 , 7 . 4 -7 ). Dionysios I fortified Epipolai, first along the northern scarp (Diod. 14 . 18 . 2 -8 (r 401 )), later along the southern scarp; it was a circuit wall running for c. 9 km, and according to Diod. 15 . 13 . 5 the 'greatest possessed by a Greek city' (Winter ( 1971 ) 314 -15 ; Karlsson ( 1992 ) 21 , fig. 1 , 23 -38 , 71 ). The west gate and the Euryalos fort were probably begun by Dionysios, but the fully developed system of bastions and ditches belong to the time of Timoleon, with the final complex from C3m (Winter ( 1963 ); Lawrence ( 1979 ) 295 -99 ). The Archaic agora has with some uncertainty been located west of the Athenaion (modern Piazza del Duomo) (Pelagatti ( 1982 ) 136 -37 ). A Classical (and Roman) agora is normally taken for granted in the southern part of the Achradina (modern Piazza Marconi/Foro Siracusano), but the evidence is inconclusive (Bernabò Brea ( 1947 ); Martin et al . ( 1979 ) 675 ). The island of Ortygia was the seat of at least three major sanctuaries: (a) in the north, the sanctuary of Apollo, with a C6e Doric temple (Cultera ( 1951 ); Barletta ( 1983 ) 72 -78 ), with a history going back to C8 ; (b) the so-called C6l Ionic temple is located on the elevated central part of the island (G.V.Gentili ( 1967 ); Barletta ( 1983 ) 86 -90 ); it is uncertain to whom the temple was dedicated (G.V.Gentili ( 1967 ) 80 suggests Artemis); it was not completed, perhaps as a result of a revision of building programmes by the Deinomenidai, who initiated instead the construction of the adjacent Athenaion;(c) the Doric temple of c. 480 -470 , now incorporated into the Renaissance cathedral, probably built by Gelon to replace earlier structures (Orsi ( 1919 ); T. Van Compernolle ( 1989 ) 45 -48 , ( 1992 ) 51 -55 ). It is normally taken for granted that this is the temple dedicated to Athena (Cic. Verr . 2 . 4 . 124 -25 ), and according to Gras ( 1990 ) the two temples mentioned in Gelon's treaty with the Carthaginians (Diod. 11 . 26 . 2 ) were temples of Athena in Syracuse and in Himera. Remains from the temenos include traces of a stepped altar, parapet and architectural fragments in Ionic style (Barletta ( 1983 ) 78 -86 ). Investigations have recently revealed a monumental entrance to the temenos and evidence of a C7l-C6e naiskos (?), altar and votive pits south of the Athenaion (Voza ( 1993 -94 ) 1286 -87 ). A sanctuary of Olympian Earth was located on the tip of Ortygia (Ath. 462 B). Large quantities of C5l-C4e votive deposits (Martin et al . ( 1979 ) 680 -86 ; Hinz ( 1998 ) 102 -7 ) found in the mainland Achradina district (modern Piazza Victoria) provide evidence of a sanctuary of Demeter and Persephone, perhaps the one embellished with two temples by Gelon after the victory at Himera in 480 (Diod. 11 . 26 . 7 ), located in the suburbs ( proasteion ) and destroyed by the Carthaginians in 396 (Diod. 14 . 70 . 4 ). A C4 graffito with a dedication to Artemis Pheraia points to a cult also of Artemis in this sanctuary (Voza ( 1973 c ) 106 -7 ). A proasteion is not compatible with a location so near the city centre according to Polacco ( 1986 ) 23 n. 6 , who suggests that the Demeter sanctuary should rather be located west of the city near the Olympieion. An Apollo sanctuary was located near the theatre in the Temenites, a locality on the outskirts of Achradina (Thuc. 6 . 75 . 1 , 7 . 75 . 1 ; for history and terminology: Drogemüller ( 1969 ) 48 n. 36 , 56 -57 ). The sanctuary is now tentatively identified with the remains of an Archaic temple laid out on a terrace above the theatre (Voza ( 1993 -94 ) 1289 -90 ). After the fall of the tyranny, the Syracusans raised a statue of Zeus Eleutherios and founded an annual festival of eleutheria (Diod. 11 . 72 . 2 with Barrett ( 1973 ) 30 n. 20 ; for a survey of other festivals, see Trojani in Polacco and Anti ( 1981 ) 26 -29 ). The major suburban cult was that of Zeus Olympios west of the river Anapos (Diod. 10 . 28 . 1 (r 491 )). The extant remains are those of a C6m gigantic Doric temple, with evidence of a C7 predecessor (Orsi ( 1903 ); Lissi ( 1958 )).A neighbouring hamlet,Polichene at Thuc. 7 . 4 . 6 but Polichne at Diod. 13 . 7 . 6 , was fortified by the Athenians in 414 . A suburban Artemis sanctuary was located on the north-east outskirts of the Epipolai plateau, at the Hexapylon gate leading northwards to Megara and Katane (Orsi ( 1900 )). Two Greek theatres are known at Syracuse. ( 1 ) The larger is situated on the outskirts of the Neapolis district, the Temenites, on the slope of the Epipolai. In its main construction phase,the period of Hieron II ( 271 -216 ), it had a seating capacity of 14 , 000 -17 , 000 ; earlier Archaic or Classical phases have not been demonstrated convincingly (Polacco and Anti ( 1981 ); Polacco ( 1990 )). However, literary sources attest to an earlier phase of this theatre at least from C5e, and at least from C4m it was built of stone (Trojani in Polacco and Anti ( 1981 ) 41 -43 with refs.). A C5s architect by the name of Damokopos was associated with the building of the theatre (cf. Eust. Od . 3 . 68 ), and Aischylos produced the Women of Aitna for Hieron in 476 (see Trojani in Polacco and Anti ( 1981 ) 34 -36 with refs.). A theatre is mentioned by Diod. 13 . 94 . 1 (r 406 ), and was used as ekklesiasterion in 336 (Plut. Tim . 34 . 3 , 38 . 3 ). ( 2 ) About 100 m to the west, rock cuttings from a rectangular structure are evidence of a theatron with rectangular seating and a cavea with a diameter of 27 . 5 m; its seating capacity was about 1 , 000 . Its chronology is uncertain, though possibly C6l-C5e (G. V. Gentili ( 1952 ); Drögemüller ( 1969 ) 48 -49 ); according to Bernabò Brea ( 1967 ) 99 , the interpretation of the rectangular structure as a predecessor of the large theatre is quite uncertain, and it cannot be excluded that this building served as the meeting place for smaller political bodies or even as a bouleuterion (Ginouvès ( 1972 ) 61 -62 ; Kolb ( 1981 ) 92 ). A prison is attested in Diod. 11 . 86 . 5 (rC5m) and in Plut. Dio 57 . 3 (Hansen ( 2002 ) 36 -37 ). The earliest, Fusco, cemetery laid out east of the city was later followed by an arc of cemeteries lying around the city from there to Tyche in the west. The Archaic cemeteri... [truncated]"
48,Tauromenion (Tauromenitas),Sikelia,37.5,15.15,1760,9119,"48 . Tauromenion (Tauromenitas) Map 47 . Lat. 37 . 50 , long. 15 . 15 . Size of territory: ? Type: [A]: β . The toponym is Ταυρο µ ένιον , τό (Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 33 ; Theophr. fr. 165 ); or Ταυρο µ ενία , ηasper (Diod. 22 . 7 . 4 ). The city-ethnic is Ταυρο µ ενίτας ( I.Delos 103 . 60 ( 372 -367 ); C4 coins, infra ; Diod. 16 . 7 . 1 (r 358 )); or Ταυρο µ ένιος (Diod. 16 . 68 . 8 (r 344 )). See further Ziegler ( 1934 ) 28 . Ps.-Skylax 13 lists Tauromenion under the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , side by side with Naxos (no. 41 ), although the two cities did not exist contemporaneously; this presumably means that the text has been compiled from sources of different dates. Diod. 14 . 59 . 3 calls it a polis in the urban sense, but the reference is to the year 396 , at which time the site was not yet a Greek city (see below on the foundation). As a Hellenic community it is called a polis in the urban sense at Diod. 16 . 7 . 1 (r 358 ) and in the political sense at Diod. 16 . 68 . 8 (r 344 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4 coins ( infra ); the external collective use is found in I.Delos 103 . 60 ( 372 -367 ; cf. IG ii² 1638 B. 43 ), Diod. 16 . 68 . 9 and Plut. Tim . 11 . 4 (r 344 ); the external individual use is found in Diod. 16 . 7 . 1 (r 358 ), and is often applied to the historian Timaios (cf. FGrHist 566 , tt. 1 , 4 e, 5 , 13 ); see also IdiCos ED 52 A. 13 (C3 ). Tauromenion became a Greek polis in C4f. At 16 . 7 . 1 , Diodorus describes what would appear to be the foundation: in 358 Andromachos, the father of the historian Timaios, gathered the remnants of the Naxians whose city had been destroyed by Dionysios I in 403 (Diod. 14 . 15 . 2 -3 ), had them settled on the Monte Tauro above the abandoned site of Naxos, and named the place Tauromenion. The city soon became populous and wealthy. There is reason to believe, however, that this was not the point at which the Greek polis of Tauromenion originally came into being: not only is Andromachos described as Tauromenites at this very point,but,much more importantly,a communal dedication by the Tauromenitai at Delos is listed in Delian inventories which antedate by several years the event described by Diodorus: see I.Delos 101 . 40 ( 372 -367 ), 103 . 60 with Rutherford ( 1998 ) 83 , and this indicates that the polis existed prior to the enfranchisement of the Naxians and prior to 364 (ibid.). Nor was the site created ab novo in 358 , at least not according to Diodorus himself, who gives the following information on Tauromenion prior to 358 : in 403 , upon his destruction of Naxos,Dionysios handed its chora over to the neighbouring Sikels ( 14 . 15 . 3 ); in 396 the Carthaginian Himilkon induced the Sikels to create a fortified centre on the Monte Tauro,a site which they named Tauromenion (but see Bennet ( 1977 ) 85 ) and which Diodorus describes by the term polis ( 14 . 57 . 2 ); in 394 / 3 Dionysios attempted without success to take the Sikel polis of Tauromenion by siege ( 14 . 87 . 4 -88 . 4 ); however, by the treaty in 392 between Dionysios and Carthage, Tauromenion was assigned to Dionysios, who proceeded to expel most of the Sikels and settle selected mercenaries at the site ( 14 . 96 . 4 ). If this Dionysian settlement of mercenaries was not in fact the foundation of the Greek polis (it may have struck coins, infra ), then the polis must have come into being after this event and before the inscribing of the Delian inventories c. 374 -367 . The reason why Diodorus seems to think of the settlement of Naxians at Tauromenion in 358 as the foundation of the city may be that he drew his information from Timaios, the son of Andromachos, who may have described the event 'in maiorem gloriam patris' (so Ziegler ( 1934 ) 30 ; cf. Bennet ( 1977 ) 86 -87 ; Timaios was reputedly partial to his father, see Marcellin. Vita Thucydidis 27 ). So as a Greek polis Tauromenion was a C4f foundation; however, there is some archaeological evidence of C7 Greek presence at the site; Ps.Skymnos 289 lists Tauromenion, with Himera (no. 24 ), among the Chalkidian foundations, thus implying an early date, but this is most probably an error. Strabo 6 . 2 . 3 lists Tauromenion as a city founded by the Zanklaians of Hybla; the passage is confused, but may be explained on the assumption that Zanklaians ( = Messanians) who had been ousted from Messana in 396 by Himilkon (Diod. 14 . 58 . 3 ) took refuge in Aitnaian Hybla (although there is no direct evidence for this), and later participated in the foundation of Tauromenion (Strabo 6 . 2 . 3 ; cf. Consolo Langher ( 1996 c) 542 for this suggestion). For a survey of research and interpretations,see Ziegler ( 1934 ), Bennet ( 1977 ) 84 , and Consolo Langher ( 1996 c ). The size of the territory is unknown. It may have remained Sikel although under Greek suzerainty (Diod. 14 . 96 . 4 ; cf. Consolo Langher ( 1996 c) 538 n. 6 ). By C4l there were a number of phrouria in the territory (Polyaen. 5 . 3 . 6 ; cf. Steph. Byz. 168 . 15 ). Not much is known about the institutions and political structure of C4 Tauromenion. When Timoleon arrived at Tauromenion, its leading citizen was Andromachos: Diod. 16 . 68 . 8 describes him as οasper τηtildeς πόλεως ηasperγουacute µ ενος , and Plut. Tim . 10 . 6 -8 as οasper τηgraveν πόλιν έχων καιgrave δυναστευacuteων ; Marcellin. Vita Thucydidis 27 describes him as exercising monarchia ; he may, then, have been a tyrant (so Talbert ( 1974 ) 114 -15 ) and if so, his enfranchisement of the Naxians ( supra ) joins the long list of tyrannical population transfers in Sicilian history. Plut. Tim . 10 . 7 says that he led the politai νο µ ι µ ῶς καιgrave δικαίως , but if the ultimate source for that statement is Timaios, its reliability is questionable; it is at least possible that some Tauromenitai left the city in opposition to Andromachos (cf. Jacoby's comm. ad Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 33 ). The existence of a civic army is suggested by Diod. 16 . 7 . 9 (r 344 ), and reception of envoys is attested by Plut. Tim . 11 . 2 (r 344 ). An external communal dedication at Delos is attested by I.Delos 103 . 60 ( 372 -367 ). The site of the Sikel, later Greek city of Tauromenion north of Naxos,and originally in the chora of this city (it had been conquered by force at the foundation of Naxos; cf. Diod. 14 . 88 . 1 ), was well chosen: it is an easily defendable site on the Monte Tauro, 200 -300 m above sea level. The urban remains are mainly Heltic and Roman. The Greek city was undoubtedly fortified: remains of a circuit wall are extant near the agora (cf. also Freeman ( 1891 -94 ) iv. 109 -10 ). The settlement was fortified already during the Sikel C4e phase according to Diod. 14 . 87 . 4 -88 . 4 . The settlement comprises c. 65 ha, excluding the upper part of Monte Tauro above the city (perhaps a fortified acropolis). C7 -C5l Greek presence has been revealed by sherds found in the area of the agora, spanning the period from the early history of Naxos until its destruction by Dionysios in 403 (Bacci ( 1980 -81 b ) 742 , ( 1997 )). C6 architectural fragments of Naxian type attest to an extra-urban sanctuary in the territory of Naxos (Bacci ( 1984 -85 ) 722 -23 ), situated within the later city in what was to become the agora of Tauromenion on the plateau west of the theatre. Epigraphic and architectural evidence, and similarities with the theatre at Syracuse, point to a C3e Greek origin for the famous Roman theatre (Polacco ( 1982 ) 438 -40 ). Tauromenion may have had a C4 overall urban scheme of habitation and public structures laid out on terraces along the slopes of Monte Tauro (Bacci ( 1997 )). A rare silver dilitron with Naxian types: obv . laureate head of Apollo (Archagetes); rev . squatting Silenos; legend: ΝΕΟΠΟΛΙ [ ΤΩΝ ] (Cahn ( 1944 ) 146 no. 149 ), has been attributed to the mercenaries of Dionysios' 392 settlement, although the issue may have been made only after the death of Dionysios (S. Calderone ( 1956 ); followed by Consolo Langher ( 1996 c ) 538 -39 ). A large bronze coinage in three denominations was struck in the reign of Andromachos c. 357 -344 . Types: obv . head of Apollo Archagetes laureate, legend: ΑΡΧΑΓΕΤΑΣ ; rev . bull walking or galloping, at times man-headed, or bull-head protome, legend: ΤΑΥΡΟΜΕ , ΤΑΥΡΟΜΕΝΙΤΑΝ , with variations ( SNG Cop. Sicily 916 -20 ). The type and legend of Apollo Archagetes (cf.App. B Civ . 5 . 12 . 109 ) testify to Tauromenion's ambition to be the heir of Naxos (for the period of Timoleon, see Brugnone ( 1980 ) 279 ). The type of Apollo, influenced by a type known from earlier issues of the Chalkidic cities, is crucial testimony to the importance of the Tauromenian mint (Consolo Langher ( 1996 c ) 550 -55 ). The issues of the Timoleontic period ( 345 -338 ) were a symmachia coinage with two groups of hemilitra: obv . head of Apollo laureate, legend: ΑΡΧΑΓΕΤΑ ( Σ ) or head of Zeus Eleutherios; rev . lyre, tripod, galloping bull or bunch of grapes, legend: ΤΑΥΡΟΜΕΝΙΤΑΝ (Consolo Langher ( 1996 c ) 555 -67 ; cf. also Karlsson ( 1995 ); SNG Cop. Sicily 921 -26 )."
49,Tyndaris (Tyndarites),Sikelia,38.1,15.05,1060,5544,"49 . Tyndaris (Tyndarites) Map 47 . Lat. 38 . 10 , long. 15 . 05 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: α . The toponym is Τυνδαρίς , ηasper ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 93 ( 230 -210 ); Strabo 6 . 2 . 1 ), or Τυνδάριον (Ptol. Geog . 3 . 4 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is Τυνδαρίτης ( IGUR ii 823 (Hell.); Diod. 13 . 69 . 3 ) or Τυνδάριος (Diod. 23 . 5 (r 263 / 2 )). Tyndaris is called a polis in connection with its foundation in 396 in Diod. 14 . 78 . 5 , a passage which presumably uses polis primarily in the urban sense although the presence of the terms πολιτευacuteεσθαι and πολιτογραφουtildeντες indicates that the term may carry the political sense as well (cf. Hansen ( 2000 ) 175 -76 ). According to the text, the community πολλουgraveς πολιτογραφουtildeντες quickly grew to number more than 5 , 000 : this implies grants of citizenship and registration of citizens, and thus shows that Tyndaris was a polis ; the city furthermore struck coins in C4m ( infra ), concluded a treaty of symmachia with Timoleon (Diod. 16 . 69 . 3 , a passage which also mentions armed forces of the city) and had a Delphic theorodokos in C3s ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 93 ( 230 -210 )). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4m coins ( infra ); the external collective use is found in Diod. 16 . 69 . 3 (r 344 ); and the external individual use is found in IGUR ii 823 (Hell.). Tyndaris was founded as a fortress by Dionysios I in 396 (Diod. 14 . 78 . 5 ; cf. Consolo Langher ( 1996 b )) on the coast c. 60 km west of Messana (no. 51 ). The city was populated with 600 Peloponnesian Messenians expelled from Zakynthos (no. 141 ) and Naupaktos (no. 165 ; Asheri ( 1983 )). T erritory for the new community was taken from that of the city of Abakainon (no. 5 ; Diod. 14 . 78 . 5 ), and the defeat of Magon at Abakainon by Dionysios finally secured the territory of Tyndaris (Diod. 14 . 90 . 4 ). The Messenians named their city Tyndaris after the cult of the Tyndaridai . By admission of new settlers shortly after the foundation the population of Tyndaris grew to more than 5 , 000 (Diod. 14 . 78 . 6 ). The territory bordered inland upon that of Abakainon; to the east it was delimited by the territory of Mylai, and further inland by the Sikel site of Longane. The territory may have comprised some hundreds of km ² , but that is difficult to ascertain. A close relationship with the neighbouring site of Agathyrnon is suggested by C4l (C3 according to Consolo Langher ( 1965 )) bronze coinage with types obv . head of Apollo, legend: ΤΥΝ∆ΑΡΙΣ ; rev . armed warrior, legend: ΑΓΑΘΥΡΝΟΣ (the eponym of Agathyrnon; cf. Diod. 5 . 8 . 2 ); however, the coins may be a reference to annexation of Agathyrnian territory by Tyndaris, rather than testimony of an alliance (Consolo Langher ( 1965 ) 82 n. 66 ; Lacroix ( 1965 ) 46 -47 ). The city was built in a strong military position on the top of a rocky promontory with precipitous cliffs facing seawards and with access only from the east. The town was located on a narrow plateau with three plateiai oriented north-east-south-west laid out on three levels along the length of the plateau, orthogonally crossed by stenopoi . The size of the city was about 14 ha. The extant remains are Roman, but there are traces of a Timoleontic C4m phase, and the origin of the town plan probably goes back to the time of its foundation (Bernabò Brea and Cavalier ( 1965 )).A circuit wall was erected inland along the south-east and south-west sides of the city. The first wall, going back to the Dionysian foundation, was built in rough stones faced with plaster and strengthened at intervals with pilasters built in ashlar. In C3e(?) the wall was replaced by a 4 . 5 m-wide double curtain-wall built in ashlar with internal fill strengthened with a number of square towers and a deep pincer-shaped gate (Säflund ( 1937 ) 412 -17 ; Barreca ( 1959 )). A stretch of the wall descending obliquely north-west protected access to the harbour below the city (Barreca ( 1957 )). An agora was probably located on the south-east side of the habitation area in the region of the later Roman forum . No buildings of the Greek phase are extant, but near the forum a theatre with its back to the circuit wall and facing the upper, principal plateia has a Greek phase dating to c. 300 ; the koilon had a diameter of 76 m and a seating capacity of c. 3 , 000 (Bernabò Brea ( 1964 -65 )). A cult of the Dioskouroi, the Tyndaridai , is not explicitly attested, but coin types give clear evidence that such a cult was of major importance (Ziegler ( 1943 ) 1785 ; Consolo Langher ( 1965 ) 66 ). A second, Timoleontic, series of coins have as type a head of Apollo (Consolo Langher ( 1965 ) 81 ). A Zeus cult is attested by C3 bronze coin types depicting a statue of Zeus, possibly the Messenian Zeus Ithomatas (Ziegler ( 1943 ) 1785 ). Athena, Poseidon, Dionysos and Kore(?) are shown on C3 coin types (ibid.), and Artemis Eupraxia on a C2 dedicatory relief (Fischer-Hansen ( 1992 ) no. 12 ). Tyndaris struck bronze coins in C4m,consisting of hemilitra with fractions, trias and uncia: pre-Timoleontic: obv . female head (Helen), legend: ΤΥΝ∆ΑΡΙΣ ; rev . rider/Dioskouros (Consolo Langher ( 1965 ), ( 1996 b) 581 ; SNG Cop. Sicily 948 ). Second issue (Consolo Langher ( 1965 ), ( 1996 b ) 584 ; SNG Cop. Sicily 949 ): obv . head of Apollo, legends: ΤΥΝ∆ΑΡΙ∆ΟΣ , ΤΥΝ∆ΑΡΙΤΑΝ ; rev . cock, or horse's head, or free horse (for the 'Free Horse' , Timoleontic symmachia coinage, see Karlsson ( 1995 ) and Consolo Langher ( 1997 ) 183 -85 , 188 )."
50,(Tyrrhenoi),Sikelia,,,145,803,"50 . (Tyrrhenoi) Map 47 . Unlocated. Type: C: γ . The Tyrrhenoi are known exclusively from their C4s Greek-style bronze coinage: obv . head of Athena wearing Attic helmet, legend: ΤΥΡΡΗ ; rev . standing armed Athena (Head, HN ² 190 ; Cutroni Tusa ( 1970 ) 264 -65 ). The coins, whose types reveal Athenian influence, are restruck on C4s Syracusan issues. They may belong to an anti-Syracusan ethnic group, perhaps Tyrrhenian mercenaries fighting Timoleon (cf. Diod. 16 . 82 . 2 (r 339 / 8 ); Cutroni Tusa ( 1970 ) 266 ). A settlement site of the Tyrrhenoi has tentatively been identified with sporadic habitation remains at modern Alimena in the territory of Himera (no. 24 ) (Bejor ( 1984 b ) with refs.); other proposals include a location in the region of Syracuse-Aitna (Cutroni Tusa ( 1970 ) 266 )."
51,Zankle ( Zanklaios )/Messana (Messanios),Sikelia,38.1,15.35,2703,13524,"51 . Zankle ( Zanklaios )/Messana (Messanios) Map 47 . Lat. 38 . 10 , long. 15 . 35 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A: α . The toponym is, for Zankle , ∆άνκλε ( SEG 11 1180 . 8 (C6 ); coins of C6l, infra ) or Ζάγκλη , ηasper (Hecat. fr. 72 ; Hdt. 7 . 164 . 1 ). The cityethnic is ∆ανκλαῖος ( IGDS no. 2 (C5e); coin c. 461 , infra ) or Ζαγκλαῖος (Hdt. 6 . 22 . 2 ). For Messana , the toponym is Μεσσάνα ( IG iv² . 1 95 . ii . 78 (C4m); Μεσσήνη , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 164 . 1 ); or Μεσήνη (Polyaen. 5 . 2 . 18 ). The city-ethnic is Μεσσήνιος ( SEG 28 431 ); Μεσήνιος (Polyaen. 5 . 2 . 18 ); Μεσσένιος , Μεσσάνιος (coins, infra ). Zankle is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 6 . 23 . 3 and 7 . 164 . 1 , and in the urban and political senses combined at Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 (Hansen ( 2000 ) 205 ); it is called patris at Diod. 11 . 76 . 5 (r 460 ). Messana is called a polis in the urban sense at Thuc. 4 . 25 . 10 -11 and in the political sense at Thuc. 6 . 4 . 6 ; it is called patris at Diod. 14 . 50 . 5 (r 399 ). The city-ethnic of Zankle is found in the internal collective use on C5f coins ( infra ) and in the external collective use in IGDS no. 2 (C5e), Hdt. 6 . 22 . 2 and Antiochos of Syracuse ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 9 ; the external individual use is found in Paus. 5 . 25 . 11 (rC6l); the city-ethnic of Messana is found in the internal collective use on C5 coins ( infra ) and in the external collective use in IGDS nos. 4 -5 ( 488 -485 ) and Thuc. 5 . 5 . 1 ; the external individual use is found in SEG 28 431 ( c. 467 -450 ) and Diod. 14 . 40 . 4 (r 399 ). According to Thuc. 6 . 4 . 5 , Zankle was originally settled by pirates from the Chalkidian colony of Kyme (no. 57 ), possibly implying some early pre-colonial phase (see Antonelli ( 1996 ) for a full discussion). At a later date a number of Chalkidian and other Euboian settlers joined the settlement, the oecists being Perieres from Kyme and Krataimenes from Chalkis (Thuc. 6 . 4 . 5 ; Callim. Aet . ii fr. 43 . 58 -59 , Pfeiffer, with Ehlers ( 1933 )). The implication may be that Zankle was founded in two stages: at first the settlement served merely to secure Kymaian-Chalkidian trading interests; later, with the participation of oecists, it was founded as a polis . According to Ps.-Skymnos 283 -86 (possibly drawing on Ephor. fr. 137 a; cf. Strabo 6 . 2 . 2 -3 ), however, Zankle was founded by Naxos (no. 41 ) as a sub-colony at the same time as Katane (no. 30 ) and Leontinoi (no. 33 ), i.e. c. 735 -730 . The date seems to be confirmed by the archaeological evidence (Bacci ( 1978 ); Scibona ( 1986 ) 448 ) and also bythe Zanklaian participation in the foundation of Rhegion (no. 68 ) c. 730 . The foundation of Mylai (no. 38 ) in C8l as a secondary colony of Zankle (Euseb. Chron . 90 bH) testifies to a Zanklaian area of influence along the north coast of Sicily.In 648 , Zanklaians and Syracusan exiles, the so-called Myletidai , founded Himera (no. 24 ) in western Sicily (Thuc. 6 . 5 . 1 ; Diod. 13 . 62 . 4 ). The continued ties with Himera are revealed by the fact that Skythes, the king of Zankle in C5e, went there as an exile (Hdt. 6 . 24 . 1 ). New Zanklaian settlers at Himera in the same period may be deduced from the mention of a [ φυacute ] λα ∆ανκλαία in a bronze plaque from Himera (Brugnone ( 1997 ) 271 -72 et passim ). T o the south the territory of Naxos formed a natural border (Thuc. 4 . 25 . 7 )-all in all a chora of quite vast dimensions. (For the confines of Zanklaian territory and that of Longane, see Massa ( 1991 ) 253 .) Its name was Μεσσηνία (Theophr. Hist. pl . 8 . 2 . 8 ), and by C4e it was apparently dotted with fortified phrouria (Diod. 14 . 57 . 5 -6 ). It is called γηtilde by Thuc. 6 . 4 . 5 , χώρα ευδαί µ ων at Paus. 4 . 23 . 6 , and Hdt. 6 . 23 . 5 has a reference to οιasper αγροί . Its borders are mentioned at Diod. 14 . 40 . 4 (r 399 ). The change of name from Zankle to Messana occurred c. 488 / 7 and was the result of tumultous events: at the time of the Ionian Revolt, Zankle had sent messengers to Ionia and invited settlers to participate in the foundation of an Ionian polis at Kale Akte (Hdt. 6 . 22 . 2 ; cf. C. Marconi ( 1994 )). A number of Samian aristocrats wanted to flee Samos on account of their role in the Ionian Revolt; they accepted the invitation and arrived at Lokroi Epizephyrioi (no. 59 ) at a time when the Zanklaian forces were laying siege to a Sikel town;the Rhegian tyrant Anaxilas persuaded the Samians to capture the undefended town of Zankle, which they did (Hdt. 6 . 23 . 2 -3 ). The Zanklaians called upon their ally, Hippokrates,the tyrant of Gela (at this time Zankle was presumably a subordinate ally of Hippokrates, who had defeated the city in an earlier war, cf. Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 ); Hippokrates arrived with an army and deposed Skythes, the ruler of Zankle (called basileus (Hdt. 6 . 23 . 1 ) or mounarchos (Hdt. 6 . 23 . 4 ); cf. Carlier ( 1984 ) 469 -70 ). Hippokrates then negotiated with the Samians and betrayed the Zanklaians to them in return for 'half of all the moveable property and slaves in the town,and everything in the open country'(Hdt. 6 . 23 . 5 ). Heenslaved the greater part of the betrayed Zanklaians, but turned the 300 'leading men among them' over to the Samians ( 6 . 23 . 6 ). Later, Anaxilas of Rhegion drove out the Samians, founded a city of mixed ethnicity, and changed the name to Messana after his own original homeland (Thuc. 6 . 4 . 6 ). The treaty of 405 between Dionysios and Carthage stipulated that Messana be autonomos (Diod. 13 . 114 . 1 ; Staatsverträge no. 210 ). In 399 the Messanian army deserted their generals in a war against Dionysios because the demos had not ratified the campaign (Diod. 14 . 40 5 ; Costabile ( 1978 )). In 396 Himilkon captured Messana, which was now allied with Dionysios (Diod. 14 . 57 ), but in 395 the city was repopulated by Dionysios,who settled 1 , 000 Lokrians, 4 , 000 Medmaians and 600 Peloponnesian Messenians (who were, however,quickly relocated to Tyndaris),and the city became practically a Syracusan colony, above all of military stamp (Diod. 14 . 78 . 5 ). The pro-Dionysian faction, however, was expelled again in 394 (Diod. 14 . 88 . 5 ). Monarchy is attested at Zankle in the time of Skythes ( supra ), who, however, seems to have been a subordinate of Hippokrates of Gela ( supra ). Diod. 11 . 48 . 2 (r 476 ) describes Anaxilas as being at his death tyrant of both Rhegion and Zankle (cf. Berve ( 1967 ) 156 ). In 461 , 'the Rhegians with the Zanklaians'expelled the sons of Anaxilas and liberated their cities (Diod. 11 . 76 . 5 ). The koinon dogma agreed upon by the Sicilian cities after the fall of the tyranny at Syracuse stipulated that all the mercenaries installed by tyrants in the cities of the island were to settle εν τηsubiotaηtilde ΜεσσηνίΩsubiotaα (Diod. 11 . 76 . 5 ; cf. CAH ² v. 157 ; Freeman ( 1891 -94 ) ii. 316 -17 ). A stasis broke out in 424 -422 during which one party called in help from Lokroi; the Lokrians sent some epoikoi who were later driven out (Thuc. 5 . 5 . 1 ). Another stasis is mentioned for the year 415 (Thuc. 6 . 74 . 1 ); cf. Polyaen. 5 . 2 . 18 . Ethnic animosities seem to have played a role in these staseis (Berger ( 1992 ) 54 -55 ). In 337 , Timoleon deposed the tyrant Hippon (Plut. Tim . 34 . 3 ). IGDS no. 2 . 9 , C6 = SEG 11 1180 ) reads [ τοῖ ] ς συν µ ά [ χ ]-, and the inscription presumably recorded or referred to a treaty of symmachia between Zankle and one or more unknown partner(s). In 426 Messana entered into a symmachia with Athens (Thuc. 3 . 90 . 4 ). The alliance was shortlived, and the next year Syracusans and Lokrians occupied Messana, which had revolted from Athens (Thuc. 4 . 1 . 1 ). A Messanian army and navy are mentioned at Thuc. 4 . 25 . 7 ; Diod. 14 . 40 . 4 (r 399 ) mentions an army of 4 , 000 foot and 400 horse, in addition to thirty triremes. The organisation of the army was probably based on a system of phylai , since at 3 . 90 . 2 Thucydides says that there were δυacuteο φυλαιgrave εν ταῖς Μυλαῖς τῶν Μεσσηνίων φρουρουtildeσαι . Commanders ( strategoi ) are mentioned at Diod. 14 . 40 . 5 (r 399 ). Olympic victories were achieved by Leontiskos in 456 and 452 ( Olympionikai 271 , 285 ) and by Symmachos in 428 ( Olympionikai 325 ). A C6 communal Zanklaian dedication of spoils at Olympia is found as SEG 11 1180 . 9 , 1205 and 15 246 ( = IGDS no. 2 ); Messanian dedications are attested by SEG 24 313 -14 (C5e). In communal mourning the Messenians dedicated a bronze statue at Olympia to commemorate a chorus of boys who drowned on their way to a festival at Rhegion (Paus. 5 . 25 . 2 -5 (rC5m); Cordano ( 1980 ); Pritchett ( 1999 ) 252 -54 ). In 356 / 5 , a citizen of Messana served as Epidaurian theorodokos ( IG iv² . 1 95 . ii . 78 ). Zankle was founded near the narrowest point of the Straits c. 10 km south of Cape Pelorus on a low coastal plateau facing a natural, sickle-shaped harbour from which the city took its Sikel name (Thuc. 6 . 4 . 5 ). The ancient city has suffered heavily from the later urban history of the site and from numerous earthquakes and landslides:the Archaic and Classical remains are often 4 -5 m below the present surface. The settlement lay along the inner harbour and upon the sickle-shaped peninsula that enclosed the harbour. The main area of habitation seems to have been the area west and south of the harbour,stretching c. 1 km inland from the coast in an area confined to the south by the river Cammaro and to the north-east by the harbour-in all c. 50 -60 ha (Vallet ( 1958 ) 113 -16 , pl. I; Scibona ( 1986 )). No remains of the Archaic or Classical circuit wall are known (for poliorkiai , see Hdt. 7 . 154 . 2 ( 490 s); Plut. Tim . 34 . 3 (r 337 ); cf. Diod. 14 . 56 . 4 , 57 . 3 , 58 . 3 , 78 . 5 and 87 . 1 attesting the existence of fortifications in the 390 s). During C5 the size of the habitation area may have been somewhat restricted compared to the Archaic city; the C5 cemetery is located inside the area of the Archaic city, though this may simply indicate a change in location of habitation area (Scibona ( 1986 ) 450 , 453 ). There is some evidence of an overall orthogonal plan from the early period of the settlement (Bernabò Brea ( 1972 -73 ) 176 -77 ; Scibona ( 1986 ) 449 -52 ). The harbour is known from early coin types, some of which seem to show it equipped inside with buildings or wharves. Several kilns attest to an extensive industrial quarter inside the urban area (Bacci ( 1995 ) 640 ).A theatre is mentioned by Plut. Tim . 34 . 4 . (r 337 ); the same passage refers to schools ( didaskaleia ). On the outermost part of the sickle-shaped peninsula was a sanctuary; the cult is unknown, but the finds show that its history goes back to the period of foundation (Orsi ( 1929 ) 38 -46 ). This is the main archaeological testimony of cult from the city itself, apart from the C5 votive relief from a sanctuary(?) dedicated to the chthonic divinities (Orsi ( 1912 )). For extra-urban sanctuaries, there is the tradition of the Poseidon sanctuary on Cape Pelorus (Diod. 4 . 85 . 5 -6 (r time of foundation)). The striding Zeus shown on the obv . of the single known tetradrachm from an issue struck probably in 461 commemorating the liberation from tyranny may refer to the cult of Eleutheria (cf. infra ). Coinage began c. 525 with drachms based upon the Euboian standard, with as lower denominations obols and onkiai (C. Boehringer ( 1984 -85 ) 108 -19 ). The first issue is known in four series, lasting to the conquest of Zankle by Hippokrates. The obv . type, a dolphin within a sickleshaped harbour, refers to the name and setting of the city (Belloni ( 1977 )), legends: ∆ΑΝΚ , ∆ΑΝΚΛ , ∆ΑΝΚΛΕ ; rev . incuse squares with shell in centre ( SNG Cop. Sicily 387 -88 ). An example with incuse repetition of the obverse is a unique example of the incuse fabric of Magna Graecia used in Sicily (C. Boehringer ( 1984 -85 ) 109 , pl. 11 . 3 ). The Samian occupation 494 / 3 -489 / 8 is reflected in tetradrachms struck on the Euboian-Attic standard, the obv . with a frontal lion scalp, the rev . with a prow of a ship (the samaina ), and on some a retrograde letter of the sequence A to E. Each letter probably represented one year's coinage, and the letter sequence therefore corresponds to the five years of Samian occupation. Of the lower denominations the diobols carry the additional symbol of a helmet on the rev . (Barron ( 1966 ) 40 -43 ; SNG Cop. Suppl . 68 ). The first issues of Anaxilas' regime, spanning the period 488 -480 , were tetradrachms struck on the Euboian-Attic standard with obv . lion's head facing; rev . forepart of calf, legend: ΜΕΣΣΕΝΙΟΝ (Caccamo Caltabiano ( 1993 ) 17 -31 ). From 480 Anaxilas struck tetradrachms with obv . biga of mules; rev . running hare, in commemoration of his victory at Olympia, legend: ΜΕΣΣΕΝΙΟΝ ; this becomes the canonical C5 type, with smaller denominations-mainly litrai and its fractions (ibid. 31 ff; SNG Cop. Sicily 389 -90 ). The fall of the tyranny in 461 allowed for a short period the re-establishment of the Zanklaian faction, which struck a commemorative issue known from a unique tetradrachm: obv . Zeus at altar hurling thunderbolt; rev . dolphin, shell, legend: ∆ΑΝΚΛΑΙΟΝ ; litrai have the legend ∆ΑΝ (Caccamo Caltabiano ( 1993 ) 63 -66 , 238 ; cf. also Lacroix ( 1965 ) 24 -25 ). These were soon followed by Messanian issues. The legend of the reverse changed the earlier Ionic spelling to Doric ΜΕΣΣΑΝΙΟΝ or ΜΕΣΣΑΝΙΩΝ ## II. The Poleis"

Only after the Classical period does ' Ηρακλεώτης appear ( BE ( 1964 ) no. 247 (C1 ); Diod. 13 . 3 . 4 (r 415 ); Strabo 6 . 1 . 14 ), but ' Ηράκλειος is none the less often qualified by απ ' ' Ιταλίας to distinguish it from the ethnics of other cities of the same name ( CID ii 6 .B. 2 ( c. 358 ); BCH 23 ( 1899 ) 501 nos. 16 -17 (both C4 )). Herakleia is called a polis in the urban sense at IG xiv 645 . i . 64 (C4l) and implicitly at Ps.-Skylax 14 , where Herakleion is the first toponym listed after the heading πόλεις εισιgraveν αιasperacuteδε (cf. Diod. 12 . 36 . 4 (r 433 / 2 )); it is called a polis in the political sense at IG xiv 645 . i . 2 , i . 95 (C4l), etc. Damos is found at IG xiv645 . i . 119 (C4l). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4 coins ( infra ) and at IG xiv 645 . i . 11 (C4l); the external collective use is found in CID ii 6 .B. 2 ( c. 358 ) and Diod. 13 . 3 . 4 (r 415 ); the external individual use is found in BCH 23 ( 1899 ) 501 -2 nos. 16 -17 (C4 ) and BCH 63 ( 1939 -41 ) 150 (C4 ). Patris is found in Anthologia Lyrica Graeca 1 p. 11 , Diehl. Herakleia was a joint foundation of Taras (no. 71 ) and Thourioi (no. 74 ): after a war for influence in the Siritis (Antiochos ( FGrHist ) fr. 11 ; cf. IvO 254 -56 ( c. 440 ) and Diod. 12 . 23 . 2 (r 444 )) these two cities made an agreement to found a joint colony (Antiochos loc. cit . = Staatsverträge 158 ). According to Antiochos ( loc. cit .), however, the city was founded in the name of Taras ( τηgraveν αποικίαν κριθηtildeναι Ταραντίνων ), and confirmation of Tarantine predominance may be seen in the fact that Herakleia's eponymous official was an ephor ( IG xiv645 . i . 1 (C4l); SEG 30 1162 -70 (C4l-C3e); cf. also IG xiv 645 . i . 146 (C4l) for the term ρasperηtildeτραι = laws). Diod. 12 . 36 . 4 dates the foundation to 433 / 2 and treats it as a purely Tarantine enterprise (as does Strabo 6 . 1 . 14 ; cf. 6 . 3 . 4 (r 330 s), where Herakleia is described as 'in Tarantine territory' and a war between Taras and the Messapians περιgrave ' Ηρακλείας is mentioned).According to Diodorus ( loc. cit .), the city was founded at the site of Siris (no. 69 ), whose inhabitants were deported. According to Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 11 , 'Herakleia'was not the original name: the city was thus named only after having changed its location ( ' Ηράκλειαν δ ' υasperacuteστερον κληθηtildeναι , µ εταβαλουtildeσαν καιgrave τουacuteνο µ α καιgrave τοgraveν τόπον ), and a combination of Diodorus and Antiochos would suggest that the city was originally founded as Siris at the site of Siris, but later relocated and then named Herakleia. Such a reconstruction is not, however, supported by the archaeological evidence, which clearly shows Herakleia to have occupied the site of Siris ( infra ). According to Strabo 6 . 1 . 14 , Siris served as the epineion of Herakleia, but the reference is not to the historical Siris but to the legendary polis Troïke of the same name. In the chora , traces of land division have been examined by Guy ( 1995 ). Sacred land belonging to Dionysos and Athena Polias is attested by IG xvi 645 . i , ii (C4l) respectively. These Tabulae Heracleenses (C4l) deal with the recovery and the measuring of the fields belonging to the two divinities, probably from the time of the foundation in 433 / 2 (Sartori ( 1967 ) 37 -76 ). T o the north along the river Cavone (ancient Akalandros) the territory of Herakleia bordered upon Metapontine territory, the western border being constituted by the natural strongpoint of the hills of Anglona with the settlement of Santa Maria d'Anglona. This originally indigenous site with a history of C7 -C6 Helation (see Siris (no. 69 )) has revealed sporadic C5l settlement remains and a C4sanctuary of Demeter and Artemis (Rüdiger ( 1969 ); Osanna ( 1992 ) 98 , 109 -10 no. 10 ). A city ( polis ) of Pandosia is mentioned by Plut. Pyrrh . 16 . 5 in connection with Pyrrhos' encampment near Herakleia in 280 and at IG xiv 645 . 12 , 54 , 64 , etc.). This Pandosia is now commonly identified with the settlement of Anglona (Sartori ( 1967 ) 28 n. 52 , 95 ; E. Greco ( 1992 b ) 34 , 37 ; Barr . 45 ). Other C5 -C4sanctuaries are known in the chora (Bini ( 1989 ); Osanna ( 1992 ) 97 -105 ). Farmsteads seem to have been concentrated mainly along the valley of the river Sinni (ancient Siris) and to a lesser degree in the valley of the river Agri. In C4e a line of border fortifications was laid out along south-western hills bordering upon Leukanian territory. Harbour settlements near the estuary of the river Sinni are inferred from cemeteries. To the south the territory of Herakleia was delimited by rural sites in the valley of the Torrente S.Nicola.In total the territory comprised about 350 km ² (overall view: Osanna ( 1992 ) 97 -114 ). Herakleia was a member of the Italiote League ( Staatsverträge 230 ), and in C4 the city became the seat of the League, which had previously been centred on Kroton (no. 56 ; Polyb. 2 . 39 . 5 -6 ). Alexander the Molossian transferred the seat to Thourioi (no. 74 ) (Strabo 6 . 3 . 4 ); he also reconquered the city from the Leukanians, who must then have taken it (Livy 8 . 24 . 4 (r 326 )). Several citizens of Herakleia were appointed proxenoi by Delphi (no. 177 ) in C4 : BCH 23 ( 1899 ) 501 no. 16 , 502 no. 17 , and BCH 63 ( 1939 -41 ) 150 ; the latter two were appointed theorodokoi as well. A system of civic subdivisions, involving two different kinds of groupings, is attested for C4l by IG xiv 645 ; see further Jones, POAG 162 -64 with refs. A tyranny at Herakleia is mentioned by Phainias fr. 16 , Wehrli, but its historicity is doubtful since the story associated with it is located in Metapontion (no. 61 ) by other sources (Berve ( 1967 ) 610 -11 ). IG xiv 645 . i . 49 -50 (C4l) refers to legal proceedings initiated by the ορισταί against private citizens who had encroached upon sacred land. The inscription (e.g. at i . 55 ) distinguishes between h ιαρά and Γaltιδία land. The following officials are attested: an eponymous ephoros ( IG xiv 645 . i . 1 (C4l); SEG 30 1162 -70 (C4l-C3e)); an annual board of two πολιανό µ οι ( IG xiv 645 . i . 96 -97 , i . 104 , i . 164 -65 (C4l)); an annual board of σιταγέρται in charge of a public granary ( IG xiv 645 . i . 102 (C4l)); two boards of ορισταί ( IG xiv 645 . i . 2 (C4l)) presumably elected (h αιρεθέντες : IG xiv 645 . i . 9 (C4l)) ad hoc ; a grammateus ( IG xiv 645 . i . 188 (C4l)). The assembly = αλία , is mentioned at IG xiv 645 . i . 12 , ii . 9 -10 (C4l), and qualified as κατάκλητος 'specially summoned' (Sartori ( 1953 ) 96 ; Ghinatti ( 1996 ) 87 ). The work carried out by the ορισταί and recorded by IG xiv 645 (C4l) was decreed by the katakletos alia ( i . 12 ). Two month names ( Απελλαῖος , Πάνα µ ος ) are attested by IG xiv 645 . i . 2 , 101 (C4l). The onomastics of IG xiv 645 indicate that non-Greeks had been absorbed into the citizenry (Lomas ( 2000 ) 178 -79 ). The city was situated on the low and narrow east-westoriented plateau (modern Policoro), between the estuaries of the rivers Akiris and Siris, the site of the C8foundation of Siris (no. 69 ). The evidence suggests some measure of occupation of the Policoro plateau from the Siris phase to the C5s foundation of Herakleia (Hänsel ( 1973 ) 491 ; Adamesteanu ( 1985 a ) 63 ). Herakleia occupied two main areas of habitation: an upper city and a lower plateau to the south,divided from the upper city by a depression occupied already from the Archaic period by sanctuaries. A C5 ashlar circuit wall has been revealed on the south and south-east side of the 'acropolis' , on the northern side of the plateau, and sporad- ically along its southern side, implying a primary habitation of the plateau.A subsequent phase comprising the lower city was previously seen as a result of the growing importance of Herakleia in C4e as head of the Italiote League (Adamesteanu ( 1985 b ) 98 ). Recently an overall, contemporary 433 / 2 occupation of the whole site has been argued, comprising an urban area of c. 140 ha (Giardino ( 1998 ) 192 -93 ). Habitation on the central part of the upper plateau was laid out on both sides of the east-west plateia which crossed the middle of the plateau. The area has been interpreted as a kerameikos with workshops inserted into the domestic structures, and in use from C5 to early third century ad . The interpretation of the urban layout of the lower city is based upon aerial photography; this has revealed a plan of at least eight plateiai ; although the orientation is generally east-west,it is different from that of the upper city. The lower city is protected on its southern,eastern and western sides by C4 -C3 ashlar circuit walls, strengthened with towers and an outer ditch. The slope and valley between the upper and lower plateau were reserved for sanctuaries and areas of public use,such as the agora,lying outside the urban plans of the upper and lower city (Neutsch ( 1967 ) 110 -50 ; Hänsel ( 1973 ); Adamesteanu ( 1985 b ); Giardini ( 1992 ), ( 1998 )). Cult had continued uninterrupted in the sanctuary of Demeter from the Siris phase through C5 to C4 , when structures were laid out on a system of terraces, an architectural sophistication reflecting the status of Herakleia as head of the Italiote League (Pianu ( 1989 ); for the cult: Neutsch ( 1967 ) 134 -36 , ( 1980 ) 158 -65 ; Sartori ( 1980 ); Hinz ( 1998 ) 187 -93 ). The sanctuary housed also the cults of Artemis Soteira (Neutsch ( 1967 ) 134 ), and Artemis Bendis was venerated in her role as divinity of asylia (Pianu ( 1989 ) 108 ; Curti ( 1989 ) 28 -29 ). Other votive material indicates a cult of Athena,attested also by the coin types ( infra ); Athena Polias is attested at IG xiv645 . ii . 5 (C4l). The central area of the valley was occupied by the sanctuary of the 'Archaic Temple' ,of uncertain cult, which was enlarged in C5 -C3 to comprise various religious buildings, treasuries, a hestiaterion (?), as well as a vast public space interpreted as the agora (Pianu ( 1991 )). The sacred lands of Athena and Dionysos attested by the Tabulae probably occupied the area north of the city, since this area has been shown to have been unoccupied. The cemeteries were located to the east, south and west of the city; rites were mainly inhumation in cist-slab tombs, and some graves are rich in tomb gifts reflecting the city's ceramic production (Degrassi ( 1967 ); Da Leukania a Lucania 151 -97 ). Cults of Hestia and Aphrodite are attested by IG xiv 646 (C4 -C3 ). Herakleia minted silver coins from the time of its foundation on the Achaian-Thourian standard, but with the Tarantine system of denominations (Van Keuren ( 1994 )). The first series, c. 432 -420 , were diobols: obv . head of Herakles, or Athena in Attic helmet; rev . lion, legend ΗΕ ( SNG Cop . Italy 1098 -1100 ), or Herakles strangling lion, legend: ΗΕ , h ΕΡΑΚΛΕΙΩΝ , h ΗΡΑΚΛΕΙΩΝ (Van Keuren ( 1994 ) nos. 23 -40 ; Rutter, HN ³ 1358 -60 ). Staters were issued c. 430 -400 (?): obv . head of Athena, helmet decorated with olive wreath; rev . Herakles seated on a rock pouring a libation, legend ΗΡΑΚΛΗΙΩΝ , sometimes retrograde (Van Keuren ( 1994 ) no. 1 ; Rutter, HN ³ 1362 ). Later series of staters and diobols c. 420 -C4l have types: obv . head of Athena wearing Attic helmet, decorated with hippocamp or Skylla, on one die the legend ΑΘΑΝΑΣ ; rev . Herakles standing or kneeling,fighting the Nemean lion (Rutter, HN ³ 1363 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1101 -4 , 1115 -32 ). The dies of some issues are signed ΑΡΙΣΤΟΧΕΝΟΣ , a die-engraver also known from Metapontion (Rutter, HN ³ 1373 ). From c. 334 a new issue of diobols and staters, possibly related to Alexander the Molossian (Van Keuren ( 1994 ) 28 -29 , 32 ), have rev . Herakles standing, holding club and lion skin (Rutter, HN ³ 1381 , 1383 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1105 -14 ). The types with Herakles are obviously connected with his cult in a city named after him, and on the reverse of the early staters he may be pouring a libation in the role of oikistes (Rutter ( 1997 ) 47 ). A single issue of gold (quarter-stater) of C3e has been attributed to Herakleia (Van Keuren ( 1994 ) no. 124 ; Rutter, HN ³ 1421 ); bronze coinage was introduced in C4 (Rutter, HN ³ 1436 ff; SNG Cop.Italy 1133 -43 ). Herakleian and Tarantine C4l-C3silver fractions have similar types and suggest federal production. A communal donation towards the rebuilding of the Delphic temple is recorded by CID ii 6 .B. 2 ( c. 358 )."
53,Hipponion (Hipponieus),Italia and Kampania,38.4,16.05,1879,9896,"53 . Hipponion (Hipponieus) Map 46 . Lat. 38 . 40 , long. 16 . 05 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Ειπώνιον , τό (Archestratos fr. 35 . 8 , Olson and Sens). The corresponding city-ethnic is found as Γaltειπονιευacuteς in SEG 11 1211 ( 525 -500 ), and C4 coins ( infra ) use the form Ειπωνιευacuteς (abbreviated as ΓaltΕΙΠ on the earliest C4 coins: RE viii.A. 2005 : Lombardo ( 1989 ) 452 ); Ps.-Skylax 12 and Douris ( FGrHist 76 ) fr. 19 have ' Ιππώνιον for the toponym ( ' Ιππώνειον is found at App. B Civ . 5 . 91 ). The corresponding city-ethnic ' Ιππωνιευacuteς is found at Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 20 . 7 . 3 (r 388 ) and F.Delphes iii . 1 179 (C4l-C3e); at Thuc. 5 . 5 . 3 the MSS have ' Ιτωνέας , which is commonly and probably correctly emended to ' Ιππωνέας or ' Ιππωνιαtildeς (cf. Hornblower ( 1996 ) 434 -35 ; Lombardo ( 1989 ) 452 ); but Steph. Byz. 342 . 10 does mention an ' Ιτώνη . . . ' Ιταλίας (which may, however, be identical with Hipponion: RE viii.A. 2004 -5 ; contra Lombardo ( 1989 ) 452 ). Finally, Diod. 15 . 24 . 1 (r 379 ) has ' Ιππωνιάτης , and ' Ιππωνείτης is found in SEG 2 635 (Hell.). Hipponion is one of ten toponyms listed at Ps.-Skylax 12 after the heading πόλεις εισιgraveν ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense (cf. Douris ( FGrHist 76 ) fr. 19 and Diod. 14 . 107 . 2 (r 388 )); Thuc. 5 . 5 . 3 calls the Hipponieis apoikoi of the Lokrians. The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested on C4 coins ( infra ); the external collective use is attested by SEG 11 1211 ( 525 -500 ), probably by Thuc. 5 . 5 . 3 ( supra ) and by Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 20 . 7 . 3 (r 388 ) and Diod. 15 . 24 . 1 (r 379 ); the external individual use is found in F.Delphes iii . 1 176 (C4l-C3e), which describes a man as Λοκροgraveς εκ τῶν ' Επι [ ζε ] φυρίων ' Ιππωνιευacuteς ( infra ). Hipponion was a colony founded by Lokroi (no. 59 ) (Thuc. 5 . 5 . 3 ; cf. Ps.-Skymnos 308 and Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 ). Archaeological evidence points to a foundation in C7l ( infra ). The scanty evidence shows very varied relations between Hipponion and its metropolis : (a) SEG 11 1211 ( 525 -500 ), a joint dedication by Hipponion, Medma (no. 60 ) (also a Lokrian colony), and Lokroi (cf. Lombardo ( 1989 ) 429 ) at Olympia of spoils taken from Kroton (no. 56 ), implies a military alliance between colony and mother city, but has nothing on its origin or duration (Hornblower ( 1996 ) 434 -35 ), and nothing about the political status of Hipponion vis-à-vis Lokroi (Lombardo ( 1989 ) 428 -31 ); (b) Thuc. 5 . 5 . 3 attests to a war between Lokroi and Hipponion and Medma but gives no explanation of the issues involved (see further Lombardo ( 1989 ) 431 -40 ); (c) F.Delphes iii . 1 176 (C4l-C3e) is a Delphic grant of proxeny etc. to a man described as Λοκροgraveς εκ τῶν ' Επι [ ζε ] φυρίων ' Ιππωνιευacuteς ; this unique combination of city-ethnics presumably indicates some kind of political interdependence between the two communities (Graham ( 1964 ) 94 ; Savalli ( 1989 ) 467 ), but ( pace Graham ( 1964 ) 94 -95 ) this evidence can hardly be retrojected into the Archaic and Classical periods (cf. Hornblower ( 1996 ) 434 -35 ). Evidence from cemeteries and sanctuaries points to a C7l foundation date for Hipponion ( infra ), confirmed by Greek influence in local, indigenous tombs-for instance at Torre Galli (Arslan ( 1986 ) esp. 1031 -32 , 1042 , 1052 -54 ; Lombardo ( 1989 ) 424 n. 29 ). Evidence of Greek presence in the territory of Hipponion comes primarily from the area between the city and the coast, where ceramic evidence indicates Greek presence from C6 (see also the entry for Medma). The coastal chora of Hipponion was consolidated by C5 : the evidence is a coastal sanctuary (dedicated to Persephone?) and C5 -C4 remains of, presumably, agricultural and maritime structures (Ianelli ( 1989 ); Givigliano ( 1989 ) 745 -46 ). The coastal plain, between Nicotera and the river Angitula, covers about 120 km ² , but the territory of Hipponion would have comprised about 200 km ² if the valleys south of the city were part of the territory. Agathokles of Syracuse built an epineion (Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 ), and remains of this have been identified on the coast below Hipponion between the rivers S. Anna and Trainiti at Castello Bivona and Porto Salvo (Lena ( 1989 ) 601 -7 ). The route between Hipponion and the coast was consolidated by C5 , with an extra-urban sanctuary near the coast at Castello Bivona (Givigliano ( 1989 ) 748 -51 ). Hipponion may have been a member of the Italiote League (Lombardo ( 1989 ) 438 ). An alliance of Hipponion with Lokroi (cf. Lombardo ( 1989 ) 429 ) and, presumably, Medma in C6l is implied by SEG 11 1211 ( 525 -500 ), a joint dedication by these three cities of spoils taken from Kroton. Thucydides' phrasing at 5 . 5 . 3 ( οasper προgraveς ' Ιππωνιαtildeς καιgrave Μεδ µ αίους πόλε µ ος ) suggests that Hipponion and Medma were allies in the war against Lokroi c. 422 . In 388 Hipponion was conquered by Dionysios I of Syracuse, who relocated the inhabitants to Syracuse (no. 47 ), razed the city, and handed over its territory to the Lokrians (Diod. 14 . 107 . 2 ; cf. Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 20 . 7 . 3 ). Apparently,not all Hipponieis were relocated; at least, when describing the refoundation of the city at 15 . 24 . 1 (r 379 ), Diodorus states that the Carthaginians restored the city to the 'Hipponiates in exile' , and these may have been exiled when Dionysios took the city; Diodorus' phrasing leaves open the possibility that exiles other than Hipponieis were settled in the refounded city (Lombardo ( 1989 ) 439 ). In 356 , the city was subdued by the Brettians (Diod. 16 . 15 . 2 ); but any long-lasting Brettian possession of the city is hardly to be assumed (cf. Lombardo ( 1989 ) 440 -43 ). F.Delphes iii . 1 176 (C4l-C3e) is a grant of proxeny etc. by Delphi (no. 177 ) to a man described as Λοκροgraveς εκ τῶν ' Επι [ ζε ] φυρίων ' Ιππωνιευacuteς ( supra ). Hipponion was founded on a steep-sided plateau c. 500 m above sea level. There are no traces of the Greek urban layout or habitation structures, which have all been obliterated by the mediaeval city. However, the extant remains of the c. 6 km-long circuit wall and the morphology of the site indicate a fortified area of about 80 ha; the urbanised area, presumably about the size of the mediaeval city,comprised about 40 ha (Aumüller ( 1994 ) 248 fig. 1 ). The city probably had an urban layout similar to that of other Greek colonies, with open unoccupied spaces (Ianelli and Giviglaino ( 1989 ) 677 -81 ). The circuit wall has four structural phases (Aumüller ( 1994 ); Ianelli ( 2000 a )): the first phase ('A '), C6s-C5f, had foundations roughly constructed of boulders, possibly supporting a brick superstructure. The second phase ('B'),C5s-C4f, is an ashlar wall with rectangular towers, unusually placed inside the curtain-wall. The destruction and later enlargement of this phase is possibly connected with destruction by Dionysios I in 388 and the later Carthagian-sponsored refoundation of the city. Later phases are connected with the incursions of the Brettians and possibly with the wars of Agathokles.The eastern part of the city, the Cofino plateau, though not urbanised, was fortified from the early history of the city, but may have been separated from the central area by a transverse wall, a sort of diateichisma , at a later date (Aumüller ( 1994 ) fig. 1 'a-a'and 'b-b'; cf. also Ianelli and Givigliano ( 1989 ) 672 -77 , 679 pl. 53 ). The sanctuaries are, primarily, situated along the east and north edge of the plateau, a system of ' sacra cintura ' known, for instance, from Akragas and Lokroi (Parra ( 1996 b ), ( 2000 )): to the north on the top of 'BelvedereTelegrafo' is a C6m temenos with naiskoi and a monumental, C6l peripteral Doric temple; to the east is the temenos 'Contorno del Castello'; a C5l-C4e Ionic temple is located on the Cofino plateau; c. 150 north-west of temple are remains of a small temenos with votive deposits and naiskos (?) and a via sacra (Quilici ( 1990 )). The evidence for the cults is above all C5f pinakes of Lokrian type with Persephone-Kore iconography (cf. Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 ), though one type is unique, with an Aphrodite iconography not known from the Lokroi pinakes (Parra ( 1989 ) 559 -65 , ( 1996 b ) 142 -43 ; Hinz ( 1998 ) 211 -12 ). C4figurines indicate a Demeter cult (Ianelli ( 1996 c ) 147 ). A very rich votive deposit in 'località Scrimbia' covers the period c. 570 -C5 and testifies to a wealthy aristocracy (Sabbione ( 1996 ); Hinz ( 1998 ) 212 ). Cults of Zeus, Athena and Hermes seem to be indicated by the coin types ( infra ), as does one of a local nymph Pandina.The C7 -C6 cemeteries were located on the western outskirts of city, originally outside the circuit walls, perhaps later within (Arslan ( 1986 ); M. D'Andria ( 1989 ); Ianelli ( 2000 b)). Like its metropolis Lokroi, and the other Lokrian subcolony of Medma,Hipponion did not issue coins until C4m, when it initiated a bronze coinage. The first phase is dated before the Brettian conquest in 356 or after, on the basis of Brettian influence on letters in the legend ΓaltΕΙ or ΓaltΕΙΠ (cf. Lombardo ( 1989 ) 441 -43 , who argues for periods of Hipponian autonomy in C4s-C3e). Obv . head of Hermes; rev . eagle, or amphora or kerykeion (Rutter, HN ³ 2243 -54 ; SNG Cop.Italy 1829 -30 ). Later issues have obv . head of Zeus, or Apollo, with rev . types similar to those of the earlier issues; legend: ΕΙΠΩΝΙΕΩΝ (Rutter, HN ³ 2246 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1831 -34 ). One issue depicts a goddess Pandina (possibly influenced by Terina: Rutter ( 1997 ) 78 ), legend: ΠΑΝ∆ΙΝΑ (Rutter, HN ³ 2251 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1834 ). A small issue of staters on the Corinthian standard has been attributed to Hipponion on the basis of the kerykeion symbol on the rev . (Rutter, HN ³ 2242 )."

Hyele is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 1 . 167 . 3 (where Rosén's conjecture εκτίσαντο is preferable to codd. εκτήσαντο ); and 'Elea'is one of ten toponyms listed at Ps.Skylax 12 after the heading πόλεις εισιgraveν ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense. Polites is found in Speusippos fr. 3 . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C5 coins ( infra ); the external collective use is found in Arist. Rh . 1400 b 7 and possibly in SEG 24 303 (C6 -C5 ) as reinterpreted by G. Cordiano ( 1995 a ); and the external individual use is found at IG iv² . 1 258 (C4 ) and BE ( 1987 ) no. 758 (C4 ). Hyele was founded by Phokaians ( = Alalians (no. 1 )) who had abandoned the Phokaian colony of Alalia on Corsica shortly after the battle of Alalia ( c. 540 -535 ) in which they had defeated Etruscan and Carthaginian forces but suffered severe losses themselves (Hdt. 1 . 166 -67 ); according to Ps.-Skymnos 250 , a contingent from Massalia (no. 3 ) participated in the foundation. The site on which the city was founded was uninhabited before the arrival of the Hellenes (Bencivenga Trillmich ( 1990 ) 365 ). The territory of Hyele was delimited by the hills of Mt. Gelbison and Mt. Cavallara and the Classical fortresses located there, such as that of Moio della Civitella (E. Greco and Schnapp ( 1986 ); Bencivenga Trillmich ( 1990 ) 366 -67 fig. 367 ). The earlier contention that Hyele had no chora (Pugliese Carratelli ( 1970 b ) 12 -14 ) has been abandoned (cf. for instance Morel ( 1988 ) 438 -40 ); Gras ( 1985 ) 422 -23 calculates the arable hinterland of Hyele as c. 13 km ² , suggesting that a large part of the chora , above all the wooded slopes of the inland hills, was exploited for timber. E. Greco and Schnapp ( 1983 ) 382 -83 suggest that the territory within a distance of 4 -5 km of Hyele was suitable for farming. The largest territorial extension, as bounded by Poseidonian territory to the north, and at the Palinuros peninsula, delimiting the territory of Pyxous (no. 67 ) on the south, is c. 400 -500 km ² ; however, the degree of Hyele's control over this larger area is uncertain; Strabo 6 . 1 . 1 hints at armed conflicts with Poseidonia (no. 66 ) and the Leukanians, but supplies no date. No sanctuaries or second-order settlements are known in the territory (Bencivenga Trillmich ( 1990 ) 366 ). According to Strabo 6 . 1 . 1 , the offshore islands of the Oinotrides offered good anchoring places, while the estuaries of the rivers Alento and Fiumarella north and south of the acropolis also offered harbour facilities (cf. Johannowsky ( 1982 ) 234 ). Apart from these mercantile aspects the city has all the appearances of a 'populationcolony'with a chora (cf. Morel ( 1988 ) 438 -40 , 461 ). Attempts have been made to estimate the size of Hyele's population at the time of its foundation from the number of Phokaian ships that survived the battle at Alalia: twenty pentekonteres according to Hdt. 1 . 166 . 2 . A crew of eighty with families gives a figure of between 240 and 320 per ship, in all c. 4 , 800 -6 , 400 persons (Gras ( 1985 ) 421 -22 ); other calculations have reached a similar figure of c. 6 , 000 (Johannowsky ( 1982 ) 225 ). However, it is important to bear in mind that the limited agricultural resources were not the sole means of support for the population, which had important commercial contacts as well (Morel ( 1982 ); Gras ( 1985 ) 421 -25 ); cf. also the remarks by Strabo 6 . 1 . 1 on the city's reliance on the sea. Hyele was member of the Italiote League against Dionysios in 387 (Polyaen. 6 . 11 ). A squadron of twelve triremes is attested in Polyaen. 6 . 11 (r 389 ). Two citizens of Hyele were involved in the Timoleontic refoundation of Akragas (no. 9 ) (Plut. Tim . 35 . 2 ). There are few sources for the political organisation of Hyele; but a C5f tyranny is reported by Diod. 10 . 18 . 1 -2 and Diog. Laert. 9 . 26 . Parmenides was allegedly the legislator at Hyele,his native city,and each year the archai had to exact an oath from the politai to the effect that they would observe the laws of Parmenides (Plut. Mor . 1126 A/B; Diog. Laert. 9 . 23 ; Talamo ( 1989 )). The earliest preserved public enactment is a 242 asylia decree for Kos ( IGDGG no. 59 ). Hyele was founded on a coastal plateau, more prominent in antiquity when the coastline reached further inland on both sides of the promontory.The city comprised four main zones (overview: Krinzinger ( 1994 )): (a) the acropolis, at first used for habitation and later the site of Hyele's main cults; (b) the western slope of the acropolis, 'Weststadt' , divided from the main urban zone (c) by the north-south circuit wall ('Krinzinger-wall-B'), and protected on the north by 'wall-A'; (c) the main urban zone in the southern plain, 'Südstadt' ('Unterstadt') and Vignale ('Oststadt'), protected westwards by 'wall-C' , northwards by 'wall-A' , and southwards towards the coast by 'wall-E'; (d) a smaller zone on the north slope, 'Nordstadt' , protected by a separate circuit wall, 'wall-D' (Krinzinger ( 1979 ), ( 1986 )). The whole site was fortified c. 520 shortly after the foundation, but obviously not fully urbanised, thus offering plenty of space for farming and husbandry. The division of the city into quarters by diateichismata walls goes back to the early history of the site, suggesting some sort of social division or a division based upon different functions such as habitation, commerce or workshops (survey of research: Gassner and Sokolicek ( 2000 ) 95 -97 ). The circuit wall follows the crest of the hill from the acropolis to the top of Casteluccio, whence it turns southwards to incorporate a large part of the southern plain to the coast. The walls run for c. 4 km and enclose an area of c. 64 ha, comprising the 'Nordstadt'; but during the early history of the site the habitation area was probably confined to the acropolis and the adjacent hill, and covered c. 9 ha. The walls were of sun-dried brick upon a foundation of local sandstone in polygonal masonry. The C5e witnessed a monumentalisation of the early structure, with the use of accurate ashlar masonry and with towers raised at intervals of about 40 -60 m, the upper structures still in sun-dried bricks, with a C5 course that comprised also the 'Unterstadt' (Gassner and Sokolicek ( 2000 )). A third phase in C4 -C3saw various repairs and reinforcements (Krinzinger ( 1979 ), ( 1986 )). The Archaic habitation, or 'polygonal phase' , is known above all from the acropolis and its southern slope. The urban aspect is irregular, but there is some evidence of orthogonal planning, with a plateia along the south flank of the acropolis, cutting obliquely into the hill, and houses laid out on terraces on both sides of short stenopoi . On the acropolis the streets were laid out not orthogonally but in accordance with the morphology of the terrain. The lower wall structures are in local sandstone in a polygonal technique, whereas the upper structures are in sun-dried brick; there is evidence of a water supply and drainage ( Velia iii; Krinzinger and Gassner ( 1997 )). A large residential building, perhaps a ruler's house from C6l, was located further along the crest of the hill (Bencivenga Trillmich 1983 ). The lower city,'Südstadt' , was also extensively occupied from the Archaic period,and there is evidence of urban planning from the C6l-C5e phase (Krinzinger ( 1992 -93 ) 29 -37 ). The Vignale zone in the lower city reveals urban organisation and orthogonal layout of the per strigas type from C5m (Krinzinger ( 1992 -93 ); Krinzinger et al . ( 1999 )). The morphology of the site may have favoured a system of habitation on terraces, a system of urbanisation well known in the Ionian cities, such as Ephesos and others. The cavea structure under the C3 and later Roman theatre has, without substantial evidence, been interpreted as the remains of a bouleuterion of c. 470 -460 (Bencivenga Trillmich ( 1994 ) 93 -94 ). A Greek phase of the Roman theatre is perhaps evidenced by a C5e polygonal analema wall (ibid. 90 -92 ). In a later phase the cavea may have had a wooden covering, ikria (ibid. 89 -90 , 92 -93 ). The Archaic habitation structures on the acropolis gave way to a monumental temenos probably already by the late Archaic period (for a survey of the archaeological evidence for sanctuaries at Hyele, see Hinz ( 1998 ) 180 n. 1046 ). A large quasi-isodomic terrace wall ('IonicLemnian technique') gave space for a C5e Ionic temple,probably of Athena Polias (Bencivenga Trillmich ( 1990 ) 371 n. 26 ; Miranda ( 1982 )). The terrace north-east of the temple with the sanctuary of Poseidon Asphaleios (Guarducci ( 1966 ) 280 -82 ) is part of this reorganisation of the acropolis. The foundations of a C6 cult building on the western extremity of the acropolis in conjunction with votive material and inscriptions are all taken as evidence of a cult of Hera going back to the foundation of the city (Tocco Sciarelli ( 1997 ) 228 -29 ). Another sanctuary, situated further along on the crest northeast of the acropolis, with an open paved space with stoas on three sides, is attributed to Poseidon Asphaleios by a C4m inscription (Guarducci ( 1966 ) 280 -82 ). A well-built ashlar temenos wall and steps of access on the north slope belong to a C5sanctuary of Zeus, identified by a C5m cippus (Krinzinger ( 1994 ) 37 , 54 n. 52 'Zeus Agoraios'; LSAG 464 E); Miranda takes the Zeus inscriptions from the 'Altar-terrasse' as evidence of a Zeus Polieus cult (Miranda ( 1982 ) 171 -72 ; cf. IGDGG no. 53 ). The C5 cemetery was possibly laid out on the top of Castelluccio (Bencivenga Trillmich ( 1990 ) 369 -70 ), but the evidence is meagre. Early excavation maps indicate a cemetery outside the south wall ('section E'), between the city and coast. Hyele began minting silver coins on the Phokaian standard in C6s, with issues of drachms, diobols and, possibly, obols and eighth-obols (Williams ( 1992 )): obv . forepart of a lion devouring its prey; rev . an incuse pattern. No legends name the mint, but the attribution to Hyele rests on both provenance and obv . type (Rutter, HN ³ 1259 -63 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1521 -22 ). The so-called auriol-class of diobols are less certainly attributed to Hyele (Rutter ( 1997 ) 33 ; cf. IGCH 2352 ). A new series from c. 465 consists of didrachms on the Italic-Tarantine standard (Rutter, HN ³ p. 118 ): obv . lion roaring, rev . head of the nymph Hyele; legend: ΥΕΛΗ (cf. Masson, REG 108 ( 1995 ) 231 ), ΥΕΛΗΤΕΩΝ , ΥΕΛΗΤΩΝ , at times retrograde, at first on obv . in exergue, later on rev . (Rutter, HN ³ 1264 ; SNG Cop.Italy 1523 -26 ); later types: obv . female head; rev . lion ( SNG Cop. Italy 1527 -28 ). Lower denominations from c. 465 : drachms, diobols and obols: obv . head of the nymph Hyele, the dies of the drachms marked with a letter in an alphabetical sequence; rev . owl; legend: ΥΕΛΗ (Rutter, HN ³ 1265 -67 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1529 -34 ). After C5m, didrachms of a more advanced style were introduced: obv . Athena wearing richly ornamented Attic helmet similar to the type at Thourioi; rev . lion seizing stag; legends as above (Rutter, HN ³ 1270 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1535 -37 ); the drachms, diobols and obols have the same types as before.This series too has letters in an alphabetical sequence. Various silver issues were continued from C4e into Cl: rev . lion crouching (Rutter, HN ³ 1277 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1538 -92 ); sophisticated dies depict the head of Athena en face and with the signature perhaps of the engravers ( SNG Cop. Italy 1560 ); the obv . type sometimes depicts Athena in Phrygian helmet (Rutter, HN ³ 1291 , 1295 ). Bronze coinage was introduced in C5s: obv . head of nymph, or of Herakles; rev . owl (Rutter, HN ³ 1320 -21 ; SNG Cop.Italy 1554 -55 ). Later bronze types: obv . head of Herakles, or Athena,or Zeus; rev . lion, or owl, or tripod; legends as above (Libero Mangieri ( 1986 ) 116 -23 ; Rutter, HN ³ 1325 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1593 -1611 ). The late silver and bronze issues indicate cults of Athena, Apollo, Zeus and Herakles in addition to that of the nymph Hyele (Breglia ( 1966 ); Ebner ( 1978 ); Williams ( 1992 ))."
55,Kaulonia (Kauloniatas),Italia and Kampania,38.25,16.35,1631,8647,"55 . Kaulonia (Kauloniatas) Map 46 . Lat. 38 . 25 , long. 16 . 35 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Καυλωνία , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 13 ); an earlier form was Αυλωνία (Hecat. fr. 84 ; Strabo 6 . 1 . 10 ; cf. Ps.-Skymnos 320 -22 and Steph. Byz. 147 . 8 -10 ; cf. also the legend ΑΥΛ on a C5e coin ( infra )). The city-ethnic is Καυλωνιάτας (C5 -C4e coins; Polyb. 2 . 39 . 6 (rC5 )); ΑΥΛ on a C5e coin ( infra ) may abbreviate an earlier * Αυλωνιάτας . Kaulonia is the second toponym listed at Ps.-Skylax 13 after the heading πόλεις εισιgraveν αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense, cf. Diod. 14 . 103 . 3 ; Ps.-Skymnos 320 (r foundation) calls it apoikia . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic in found on C5 coins ( infra ); the external collective use is found in Iambl. VP 262 and Polyb. 2 . 39 . 6 (both rC5 ). For the external individual use of the city-ethnic, see Paus. 6 . 3 . 11 , commenting on the C4f athlete Dikon of Kaulonia. Kaulonia was an Achaian foundation (Strabo 6 . 1 . 10 ; Paus. 6 . 3 . 12 ); it was founded by Kroton (no. 56 ) (Ps.-Skymnos 318 -19 ; Steph. Byz. 147 . 9 -10 ). The oikistes was Typhon from Aigion (Paus. 6 . 3 . 12 ; Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 209 ). Serv. ad Aen . 3 . 553 describes it as a colony of Lokroi (no. 59 ). The existence of a C6e circuit wall (Tréziny ( 1989 ) 129 ) points to a foundation in C7s, though Greek finds go back to C8l (Tréziny ( 1988 ) 205 ). The name of the territory was Καυλωνιαtildeτις (Thuc. 7 . 25 . 2 ). The territory of Kaulonia functioned as a buffer zone between Lokroi and Kroton. The border between Lokrian and Kaulonian territory was probably formed by the river Sagra (Giangiulio ( 1989 ) 221 -24 , 251 -52 ), whereas the border between Krotoniate and Kaulonian territory must remain more uncertain, perhaps to be located somewhere in the region of Skylletion,in which case the territory would measure c. 200 km ² . There is some archaeological evidence for an ancient harbour near the estuary of the river Assi (Ianelli, Mariottini and Lena ( 1993 )). C6m-C5m architectural fragments of about six roofs found on the hill of Passoliera c. 1 km to the south of Kaulonia testify to an important extraurban sanctuary (Barello ( 1995 ) 65 -86 ). A federation of Kaulonia, Kroton (no. 56 ) and, presumably,Sybaris on the Traeis (no. 70 .V) was established at some uncertain date in C5 with the foundation of a federal sanctuary of Zeus Homarios (Polyb. 2 . 39 . 6 ; Walbank, HCP ad loc . and ( 2000 ) 24 ). The location of the federal sanctuary of Zeus Homarios is uncertain, but the sanctuary of Punta Stilo is one of the more convincing suggestions ( infra ). The find of a heavy limestone cover from a container in the sanctuary has been taken as evidence of a treasury or archive similar to that known from Lokroi (Ianelli ( 1992 a )). In C5s, Kaulonia was, with Taras (no. 71 ) and Metapontion (no. 61 ), involved in arbitration between Kroton and returning exiles (Iambl. VP 262 ). In 389 Kaulonia was besieged and taken by Dionysios I of Syracuse (Diod. 14 . 103 ff), in spite of help from Kroton and from the Italiote League. The citizens of Kaulonia were relocated to Syracuse (no. 47 ), granted citizenship and exempted from taxes for five years (Diod. 14 . 106 . 3 ); the city was razed to the ground,and the territory handed over to Lokroi (no. 59 ; Diod. 14 . 106 . 2 ). This may perhaps explain the tradition of a Kaulonia of the Lokrians (Steph. Byz. 369 . 19 ), and the tradition (in Serv. Aen . 3 . 553 ) that Kaulonia was a foundation of Lokroi. A refoundation c. 357 by Dionysios II of Syracuse may be inferred from Diod. 16 . 10 . 2 , 11 . 3 ; cf. Plut. Dion . 26 . 7 . The C4m-s circuit wall also implies a refoundation ( infra ). The Pythagoreans probably played a political role during C6l-C5f, but the evidence is not very good (Dicaearchus fr. 34 , Wehrli: Pythagoras in Kaulonia; Iambl. VP 267 : list of Pythagoreans in Kaulonia).Nothing else is known about the political organisation, unless one accepts the attribution to Kaulonia of a C5e inscription ( IGSII 20 = SEG 4 71 ) testifying to civic subdivisions (Jones, POAG 168 ) and to the existence of an eponymous damiorgos ; its provenance, however, remains uncertain (Arena ( 1996 ) no. 52 ). Kaulonia was founded on sloping terrain facing the sea (survey of evidence: Ianelli ( 1992 b )). There is little archaeological evidence for the Archaic or Classical city, but it extended inside the area of the later circuit wall, possibly in three separate areas, with an early settlement on the Faro of Punta Stilo and a C6settlement extending as far north as 'Colle A' and southwards on the Piazzatta hill; the different areas of habitation may each have had their own orientations, but the evidence is uncertain (Orsi ( 1914 ); Tréziny ( 1989 ) 156 ). The well-preserved circuit wall postdates the 389 destruction and is of C4m or C4s (Tréziny ( 1989 ) 155 -57 ). C6 and C5 phases have been investigated inside tracts of the later wall. The C6 circuit wall probably had the same northern and western (though not including Orsi's 'Neapolis occidentale') extension as the Heltic city. To the south it remains uncertain whether Orsi's 'Neapolis meridionale' was part of the Archaic city. The Archaic walls therefore delimited an area of either 35 -36 ha or 45 -46 ha, the latter figure being the extent of the Heltic city. Eastwards, facing the sea, there is evidence of a C5 (and C6 ?) circuit wall (Tréziny ( 1989 ), esp. 129 -32 , 156 -57 ). The city was refounded after the 389 destruction, and the remains of urban structures are mainly C4m (Ianelli and Rizzi ( 1985 )). Apart from the Classical temple and its Archaic predecessor, there are remains of numerous smaller naiskoi and thesauroi in the vast temenos at Punta Stilo below the city on the coast (Barello ( 1995 )). The identity of the deity honoured there is uncertain. The main coin type suggests that the chief divinity of Kaulonia was Apollo (Lacroix ( 1965 ) 159 -61 ), possibly with the epithet Daphnephoros (Caccamo Caltabiano ( 1990 )), but see Giannelli ( 1963 ) 179 -82 and Kraay ( 1976 ) 68 -69 . An alternative suggestion is a cult of Zeus Homarios established by the Achaian League of Kaulonia, Kroton and Sybaris perhaps already in C5s (Torelli ( 1988 ) 593 ); Osanna ( 1989 ) interprets the rectangular theatre-like structure in the temenos as the seat of the Achaian League, though this should perhaps rather be looked for in neutral territory (Giannelli ( 1963 ) 182 -83 ). Substantial walls, votives and architectural terracottas on the hill of the Faro di Punta Stilo inside the urban area belong to a major C6sanctuary, possibly the earliest of Kaulonia (Barello ( 1995 ) 19 -29 ). The cemeteries were located outside the circuit wall, north-west of the city (Orsi ( 1914 )). Dikon of Kaulonia was a successful athlete who won victories at all four Panhellenic festivals (Paus. 6 . 3 . 11 ). At his earlier victories he was proclaimed a Kaulonian ( Olympionikai 379 ( 392 )), but he was probably among the Kaulonians relocated to Syracuse by Dionysios I ( supra ), and he was proclaimed a Syrakosios at his subsequent victories ( Olympionikai 388 -89 ) and is described as such by Diod. 15 . 14 . 1 (r 384 ) (cf. Stylianou ( 1998 ) ad loc .). Kaulonia struck an incuse silver coinage from c. 525 , on the Achaian standard (Kraay ( 1960 ), ( 1978 ); Rutter, HN ³ 2035 ff), according to some scholars possibly from as late as 510 (Montani Pertosa ( 1993 )). Initially, only staters were struck, but smaller denominations were issued in the late incuse phase. The type (on which see Rutter ( 1997 ) 30 -31 ) is a striding, naked Apollo ( supra ) with a branch in his raised right hand, and on his outstretched left arm a small running naked figure holding a similar branch in each hand; in a field a stag. Legends are the abbreviated ethnic, often retrograde, ΚΑΥΛ , ΚΑΥΛΟ (Rutter, HN ³ 2035 -43 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1698 -1702 ).A single triobol die carries the earlier form of the name ΑΥΛ (Kraay ( 1976 ) 169 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2041 ). A doublerelief coinage was introduced 480 -475 , with the same obv . type as on the incuse coinage; rev . stag; legends: ΚΑΥΛ , ΚΑΥΛΩΝΙΑΤΑΣ , ΚΑΥΛΟΝΙΑΤΑΝ ; the doublerelief coinage carries a complex system of letters or symbols (Rutter, HN ³ 2044 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1703 -32 ). Similar types appear on some smaller denominations (Rutter, HN ³ 2060 ff). Bronze coinage was issued from C5s: obv . head of horned river-god (the Sagra?); rev . stag (Rutter, HN ³ 2069 ). Kaulonian coinage comes to an end with the conquest by Dionysios I in 389 / 8 ."
56,Kroton (Krotoniatas),Italia and Kampania,39.05,17.05,4000,20031,"56 . Kroton (Krotoniatas) Map 46 . Lat. 39 . 05 , long. 17 . 05 . Size of territory: 4 (dominion: 5 , infra ). Type: A. The toponym is Κρότων , ηasper (Hdt. 3 . 131 ; IG iv² . 1 95 . 42 ( 356 / 5 )). The city-ethnic is Κροτονιάτας ( LSAG 104 . 22 = SEG 40426 ( 510 -470 )), sometimes spelled /Koppaροτονιάτας ( SEG 11 1211 ( 525 -500 ); coins, infra ), Κροτωνιάτης (Thuc. 7 . 35 . 2 ; Arist. fr. 600 . 1 ), or Κροτωνιήτης (Hdt. 3 . 137 . 1 ). Kroton is called a polis in the urban and political senses combined at Hdt. 3 . 137 . 3 , and in Hdt. 8 . 46 . 1 it is subsumed under the heading polis , where polis occurs in the political sense (Hdt. 8 . 42 . 1 , 49 . 1 ); Kroton is the third toponym listed at Ps.-Skylax 13 after the heading πόλεις εισιgraveν αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense. The Aristotelian collection of politeiai seems to have included a Κροτωνιατῶν πολιτεία (Heracl. Lemb. 68 ; Arist. fr. 523 , Gigon). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on coins from C5l ( infra ); the external collective use is attested in a C6l-C5e Delphic inscription ( LSAG 104 . 22 = SEG 40 426 ), and in SEG 11 1211 (C5 ), Hdt. 3 . 137 . 2 and Thuc. 7 . 35 . 2 . The external individual use of the city-ethnic is attested in Hdt. 3 . 125 . 1 , 5 . 47 . 1 ; CID ii 51 . iii . 9 ( 339 ); Arist. Gen.an . 752 b 25 . Kroton was an Achaian foundation (Hdt. 8 . 47 ; Peloponnesian in Ps.-Skymnos 328 ; Spartan participation (Paus. 3 . 3 . 1 ) is a tradition probably no older than the victory over Sybaris and the expedition of Dorieus (C6l)). The colony was founded in 709 / 8 (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 2 . 59 . 3 ; Jer. Chron . also gives Ol. 17 . 3 , and the foundation is here treated as contemporary with that of Sybaris, as in other sources, e.g. Strabo 6 . 2 . 4 , cf. 6 . 1 . 12 ; the Armenian Eusebios gives Ol. 17 . 4 , i.e. 708 / 7 ). A date not long after the foundation of Syracuse ( 733 ) is implied by Antiochos'statement that the oecist Myskellos of Rhypes in Achaia (cf. Hippys ( FGrHist 554 ) fr. 1 ) received support from Archias the oecist of Syracuse ( FGrHist 555 , fr. 10 ). See also Giangiulio ( 1989 ) 134 -48 for a reappraisal of the Delphic traditions and Myskellos. The verse oracles relating to Myskellos (Diod. fr. 8 . 17 ; Antiochos and Hippys ( locc. citt. supra )) are not genuine but 'quasi-historical' according to Fontenrose ( 1978 ) Q 28 -30 , Q 139 -140 . However, Delphi probably did play an important role in the foundation: the Delphic tripod is depicted already on the earliest Krotoniate coinage ( infra ). Herakles is named as the mythical founder on C5s coin legends (Lacroix ( 1965 ) 76 -79 pl. 5 . 7 -8 ; cf. Diod. 4 . 24 . 7 and Heracl. Lemb. 68 ). Cf. further Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 206 -8 . The name of the territory is ηasper Κροτωνιηtildeτις γηtilde at Hdt. 5 . 45 , or simply ηasper Κροτωνιαtildeτις (Thuc. 7 . 35 . 1 ; Alkimos ( FGrHist 560 ) fr. 2 ). To the north-east the river Hylias (modern Fiumenica?) formed the border with the territory of Sybaris (no. 70 )/Thourioi (no. 74 ) (Thuc. 7 . 35 . 2 ). The Lakinian promontory and the rivers Aisaros and Krimisa may mark the limits of the early territory. Later the chora of Kroton was delimited to the north by the sanctuary of Apollo Alaios, to the south by that of Hera Lakinia, and inland by the adjoining hills (Giangiulio ( 1989 ) 215 -32 ). In a 1984 survey 238 settlements and single farmsteads were recorded; by 450 -350 the territory measured about 270 km ² (Carter and D'Annibale ( 1984 ); Carter et al . ( 1990 )). The tradition of Philoktetes (Apollodorus ( FGrHist 244 ) fr. 167 = Strabo 6 . 1 . 3 ), and that of the Krotoniate possession of the bow of Herakles ( Mir. ausc . 840 a 20 ), may reflect Krotoniate expansion or ambitions on the confines of Sybarite territory (Mele ( 1983 a ) 36 -39 ) or in regard to the indigenous populations (Giangiulio ( 1991 a ) 49 -53 ). The expansion of Kroton is indicated by the foundation of two colonies in C7 : Kaulonia (no. 55 ) on the Ionian Sea (Ps.Skymnos 318 -22 ), comprising also the territory of Skylletion; and Terina (no. 73 ) on the Tyrrhenian Sea (Ps.Skymnos 306 -7 ). The territorial ambition of Kroton towards the south-west was blocked at the river Sagra, theatre of the C6m war between Kroton and Lokroi (no. 59 ) (Strabo 6 . 1 . 10 ) in which Kroton was surprisingly defeated. The maximum territorial expansion of Kroton was attained after the victory over Sybaris c. 510 , and for this period a Krotoniate dominion is attested by coins with two ethnics: in addition to that of Kroton, those of Sybaris (no. 70 ) ( /KoppaΡΟ -ΣΥ ), Pandosia (no. 64 ) ( /KoppaΡΟ -ΠΑΝ∆Ο ) and Temesa (no. 72 ) ( /KoppaΡΟ -ΤΕ ); cf. also coins inscribed ΣΥ -ΛΑΓalt ( infra ). As shown by Parise, this numismatic evidence points not to an alliance but to a dominion controlled by Kroton (Parise ( 1982 ); cf. Stazio ( 1983 b ) 967 -70 ). Kroton may have treated the cities in the dominion as dependencies, since there is evidence of a Krotoniate governor ( exarchos ) at Sybaris (Iambl. VP 74 ; Minar ( 1942 ) 70 ). In C5 , Kroton opposed the refoundation of Sybaris (Diod. 11 . 90 . 4 , 12 . 10 . 2 , cf. 11 . 3 ) and waged war against Thourioi (no. 74 ) with the help of the Pythagoreans returning from exile (Polyb. 2 . 39 . 4 ; Iambl. VP 264 ). In C5s, however, its dominion disintegrated (Kahrstedt ( 1918 ) 185 ; RE xi. 2024 -25 ). A number of important sanctuaries were located in the territory: that of Hera Lakinia on the promontory c. 10 km to the south of Kroton had a C6 origin and had developed into a pan-Italiote sanctuary by C5l. The Classical temple was a major structure of unparalleled splendour in Magna Graecia (Orsi ( 1911 b ); Spadea ( 1996 )). The other major sanctuary in the territory, at Cirò (Punta Alice), is probably that of Apollo Alaios founded by Philoktetes (Lycoph. Alex . 920 ; dedication of the bow of Herakles, Mir. ausc . 840 a 20 ); it secured the territorial interests of Kroton southwards (Maddoli ( 1983 ) 336 ; Musti ( 1991 ) 25 -27 ). Inland sanctuaries in the chora of Kroton have been found at Giammiglione and at S. Anna (Spadea ( 1983 ) 137 -38 ; Osanna ( 1992 ) 177 -79 ). In 413 , the city denied an Athenian army passage through the territory (Thuc. 7 . 35 . 2 ). Control of the territory may also be implied by Hdt. 5 . 45 . 2 mentioning a presumably public grant of land to Kallias of Elis. A C6l exile is attested in Hdt. 5 . 47 . 1 ; cf. Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 20 . 1 . 7 for C5e exiles. A C5s recall of exiles is reported in Iambl. VP 263 . The military forces of Kroton at the C6 battle on the river Sagra reputedly numbered 130 , 000 or 120 , 000 men (Strabo 6 . 1 . 10 ; Just. Epit . 20 . 3 . 4 -5 ) and 100 , 000 men in 510 (Diod. 12 . 9 . 5 ). These, obviously, are unreliable figures, but it seems correct that, after the victory over Sybaris, Kroton had the largest population of the Greek cities in Italy (cf. Diod. 14 . 103 . 4 (r 389 )); 10 , 000 citizens, the estimate of Beloch ( 1922 ) iii. 1 306 -7 , may be correct. Kroton was of Achaian origin, but relations with homeland Achaia are almost invisible in our sources (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 211 -14 ). By C6m the Achaian cities of Italy seem to have formed an alliance, e.g. in the war against Siris (no. 69 ), which was defeated by Kroton (no. 56 ), Metapontion (no. 61 ) and Sybaris (no. 70 .I) (Just. Epit . 20 . 2 . 4 ). In C5l, Kroton with Kaulonia (no. 55 ) and Sybaris on the Traeis (no. 70 .V) organised the first Italiote League (Polyb. 2 . 39 . 5 -6 ; Walbank ( 2000 ) 23 -24 ), later enlarged or refounded in opposition to Dionysios I of Syracuse and the Leukanians (Diod. 14 . 91 . 1 (r 393 ), describing it as a symmachia with a synedrion , cf. 101 . 1 ; Staatsverträge 230 ). However, Dionysios' victory on the river Eleporos in 389 was followed by a twelveyear period of dependency on the tyrant of Syracuse (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 20 . 7 ). In 356 / 5 , a citizen of Kroton served as theorodokos of Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 42 ); IG ii² 406 (C4s) is possibly a fragment of a grant of proxeny for a Krotoniate. Reception of envoys is attested in Diod. 12 . 9 . 3 (rC6l). Sending of envoys is reported in Phylarchos ( FGrHist 81 ) fr. 45 (rC6l) and Iambl. VP 263 (rC5s). The constitution of Kroton is known only from late sources of doubtful value, principally Iamblichos' De Vita Pytagorica of the third to fourth century ad . It was aristocratic/oligarchic until C5m (Iambl. VP 255 ), from C6l to C5m seemingly under strong Pythagorean influence (Minar ( 1942 ) 1 -71 ), though both democratic and tyrannical interludes are recorded. A gerousia with its archeion as well as archontes are attested for C6l (Dicaearchus fr. 33 , Wehrli; Timaeus ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 44 ; cf. Iambl. VP 126 : archeion of the 1 , 000 ), but such constitutional details are all that is known (Minar ( 1942 ) 8 ), though it may be inferred from the democratic revolution of C6l ( infra ) that, e.g., access to offices was denied the demos . A meeting of the ekklesia is attested for C6l (Diod. 12 . 9 . 4 ); the synkletos , which in connection with this meeting is distinguished from the demos (ibid.), may possibly be identical with either the gerousia or with the ' 1 , 000 ' , a body attested in Iambl. VP 45 , 126 (rC6l). For the interpretation of the 1 , 000 as the original Archaic assembly, see Sartori ( 1953 ) 116 and Ghinatti ( 1996 ) 82 -86 . Another possibility is that the 1 , 000 were a/the council (Val. Max. 8 . 12 . 15 . Ext . 1 ; cf. Minar ( 1942 ) 8 ). Democracy was introduced in C6l (Robinson ( 1997 ) 76 ) (shortly after the victory over Sybaris, since one of the causes of the revolution reported by Iambl. VP 255 was dissatisfaction with the arrangements proposed for the conquered Sybarite land) after a violent uprising against the Pythagoreans (Iambl. VP 257 -62 ); the initial demands for reform included popular access to magistracies and assemblies, and euthynai of officials by representatives chosen by lot εκ πάντων (ibid. 257 ); some of these constitutional demands may have been met (Minar ( 1942 ) 56 ). After the final democratic victory there followed sentences of exile, a redistribution of land and a cancellation of debts (Iambl. VP 262 ), though these measures have been thought to have occurred only in C5m (Minar ( 1942 ) 57 -60 ); see also Robinson ( 1997 ) 76 -77 , who accepts the whole account as referring to C6l. A tyrant, Kleinias, is with some uncertainty dated to C5e (Minar ( 1942 ) 72 ; Luraghi ( 1994 ) 72 -75 ). All that is known of him is that he secured his tyranny with the aid of exiles (presumably non-Krotoniate) and slaves, and proceeded to execute and exile the epiphanestatoi ; he may also have brought other poleis under his sway (Dion.Hal. Ant. Rom . 20 . 7 . 1 ); his revolt seems to have been against a reconstituted oligarchy (cf. epiphanestatoi ), though it is not known how it replaced the C6l democracy (Berger ( 1992 ) 20 ). A prytanis is attested in C5e (Ath. 522 C); the office of strategos is attested as well (Kratinos fr. 223 , Kock). Oligarchs were in power again in C5m,when the Pythagoreans were overthrown,but the constitutional history after Kleinias is obscure (Minar ( 1942 ) 73 ff). Kroton was founded on a coastal plain, delimited on one side by the Castello hill, the acropolis of the ancient city. There is no clear evidence of a pre-Greek indigenous settlement (Sabbione ( 1982 ) 251 , 259 ), but according to Ephor. fr. 140 it had been inhabited by Iapygians. A C4 -C2 circuit wall is known from various locations along the hills delimiting the urban centre.The morphology of the Collina del Castello and the S. Lucia hills suggests a coherent fortification system similar to Euryalos at Syracuse. The C4evidence suggests a continuous circuit (cf. the siege of 317 reported in Diod. 19 . 3 . 3 ), the river Aisaros being fortified along the banks or/and with chains across the river, in all 13 km in length (cf. Livy 24 . 3 . 1 ). The fortified area comprised c. 620 ha (cf. Diod. 21 . 4 (r 295 )); Livy 23 . 30 . 7 refers to an arx , probably the acropolis comprising the S. Lucia hills (Spadea ( 1983 ) 158 -61 ). The evidence suggests that the Greek colonists settled simultaneously over the whole of the later urbanised area, from the acropolis near the coast to the north circuit wall, i.e. including the area north of the river Aisaros. The character of the urban layout in the different zones suggests an initial settlement pattern organised in several kleroi (Spadea ( 1983 ) 124 -27 ; Lattanzi ( 1988 ) 554 ). The earliest urban organisation with a regular layout has a C7l-C6e origin. There are indications that Kroton was provided with a new town plan after Dionysios' defeat of the Italiote League at the river Eleporos in 389 , but the alterations relative to earlier grid systems are unclear (Spadea ( 1983 ) 152 -54 ). The harbour mentioned by Strabo ( 6 . 1 . 12 ) may have been located on the estuary of either the river Aisaros or the river Neaithos. According to Diod. 12 . 9 . 3 , Sybarite exiles sought refuge at altars in the agora c. 510 (cf. Hdt. 3 . 137 . 1 ). The archaeological evidence for urban sanctuaries is limited to the C6 Hera Eleutheria(?) sanctuary 'Vigna Nuova' on the outskirts of the city (Spadea ( 1983 ) 144 -50 ) bridging polis and chora (Lattanzi ( 1981 ) 224 -25 ). Other urban sanctuaries, however, are indicated by sporadic finds of C7 -C6 architectural terracottas (Spadea ( 1983 ) 136 -37 ). A cult of Zeus Soter is inferred from coin legends ( infra ), and the seat of the Achaian League in the sanctuary of Zeus Homarios has tentatively been located in the sanctuary of Hera Lakinia (De Sensi Sestito ( 1982 b )). A festival at Kroton with monetary prizes is mentioned in Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) 45 (rC6l); cf., however, Ath. 522 A with Dunbabin ( 1948 ) 370 . Remains of an ashlar structure in the area of the Nuova Vigna is interpreted as part of a theatre of uncertain date (Cristofani ( 1970 ) 269 ), but structural remains of a theatre have not been substantiated (Todisco ( 1990 ) 149 -51 ). A theatre used for public games is mentioned by Iambl. VP 126 (rC5 ?). Kroton's major cemetery on the Carrara hill, delimiting the city on its eastern side, goes back to C8l. The house of the athlete Astylos who had himself proclaimed as a Syracusan after victories at Olympia was on that account turned into a prison (Paus. 6 . 13 . 1 (r 480 s); Hansen ( 2002 ) 36 -37 ). Attested cults include those of Hera Lakinia ( LSAG 261 no. 21 (C6s); Diod. 13 . 3 . 4 ), with an important festival ( Mir. ausc . 96 ), Apollo ( Mir. ausc . 109 ; Iambl. VP 261 ; cf. also coinage, infra ), the Muses (Iambl. VP 264 ), Demeter (Timaeus ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 131 ) and Zeus Meilichios ( SEG 17 42 (C6 -C5 )). Participation in the games at Olympia is attested from 672 to 480 . Kroton was famous for its athletes (Strabo 6 . 1 . 12 ), who achieved an amazing number of victories (cf. Miller ( 2000 ) 286 -87 ; Mann ( 2001 ) 164 -91 ), of which twenty-six are mentioned in our sources ( Olympionikai 38 , 87 , 90 , 92 , 100 , 104 , 109 , 115 , 122 , 126 , 129 , 133 , 135 , 139 , 145 , 148 , 153 , 166 , 172 , 178 , 179 , 186 , 187 , 196 , 197 , 198 ). Astylos, however, the winner of various races in 484 and 480 , was on both occasions proclaimed a Syrakosios (cf. Mann ( 2001 ) 188 -89 , 246 -48 ). One of the most famous Krotoniate athletes, Phayllos, never achieved an Olympic victory, but was a triple Pythionikes prior to 480 (Hdt. 8 . 47 (twice in the pentathlon and once in running: Paus. 10 . 9 . 2 ); cf. RE xix. 2 . 1903 -4 ). Architectural fragments of Krotoniate type from Olympia and Delphi may testify to Krotoniate thesauroi (Heiden ( 1990 ) 44 ; Mertens-Horn and Viola ( 1990 ) 244 -45 ). LSAG 104 . 22 = SEG 40 426 ( 510 -470 ) is an external communal dedication to Pythian Apollo, presumably of spoils taken from Sybaris. SEG 11 1211 (C5 ), on the other hand, is a dedication at Olympia of spoils taken from Kroton and dedicated by the Hipponians (no. 53 ), the Medmaians (no. 60 ) and the Lokrians (no. 59 ) (cf. Lombardo ( 1989 ) 429 ). C5s Krotoniate publication of a public document at Delphi is attested at Iambl. VP 263 . Communal consultation of the Delphic oracle is reported by Just. Epit . 20 . 2 . 5 , 3 . 1 -3 (rC6s). Kroton minted an incuse coinage on the Achaian standard from c. 530 , mainly staters and drachms. The principal type, and sole type initially, is the Delphic tripod, legend: /KoppaΡΟ , /KoppaΡΟΤ , /KoppaΡΟΤΟ , /KoppaΡΟΤΟΝ (Stazio ( 1983 a ) 369 -74 ; Parise ( 1990 b ); Rutter, HN ³ 2075 -94 , 2100 -6 ; SNG Cop.Italy 1735 -64 ). The tripod refers to the importance of the cult of the Pythian Apollo,alluded to more specifically on C5l types ( infra ). For Apollo Pythios at Kroton: Iambl. VP , 28 . 9 -10 , 35 . 261 , discussed by Maddoli ( 1983 ) 336 . A variant type with a flying eagle on the rev . (Stazio ( 1983 a ) 375 -77 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2095 , 2108 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1765 -69 ) is either an 'alliance' or 'dominion' coin (unknown alliance city; Kraay ( 1976 ) 168 suggests Hipponion) or a reference to Zeus at Kroton or to special ties between Kroton and Olympia-an interpretation perhaps supported by later issues with a seated eagle on a column ( infra ) (Stazio ( 1983 a ) 375 -76 ). The dominion issues ( supra ; Rutter, HN ³ p. 168 ) all have the Krotoniate tripod on the obv ., with legend /KoppaΡΟ whereas the rev . type varies: Sybaris (no. 70 .II): bull standing r. looking back, legend: ΣΥ (Rutter, HN ³ 2098 ); Pandosia (no. 64 ): bull standing r. looking back (relief in incuse square), legend: ΠΑΝ∆Ο (Rutter, HN ³ 2097 ); T emesa (no. 72 ): tripod, legend: ΤΕ also C5stater, double relief, obv . tripod, legend: ΤΕ ; rev . helmet, legend /KoppaΡΟ (Gorini ( 1975 ) 26 -27 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2080 with refs.; SNG Cop. Italy 1828 ). Smaller denominations (triobols, diobols and obols) in double relief were minted from C6l and through the C5 : obv . tripod; rev . a variety of types known from other mints: Pegasos, cuttlefish, hare, cock, crab and wheel (Stazio ( 1983 a ) 377 -80 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2125 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1785 -94 ). The issue is explained as denominations used to make up the weight of Krotoniate staters to that of coins minted on other standards, or as politically motivated issues (Stazio ( 1983 a ) 381 -84 ; Rutter, HN ³ p. 170 ). The full transition from an incuse to a double-relief coinage took place c. 435 , at first with the tripod on both obv . and rev . (Rutter, HN ³ 2113 -19 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1770 -72 ), the obv . type later replaced by other types: an eagle seated on an Ionic capital (Stazio ( 1983 a ) 384 -85 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2141 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1775 -81 ); Herakles seated and the legend ΟΙΚΙΣΤΑΣ claiming Herakles as founder of the city (cf. Diod. 4 . 24 . 7 ; Stazio ( 1983 a ) 385 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2139 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1773 -74 ). The cult of the Pythian Apollo is alluded to in types with Apollo shooting arrows at the Python (Lacroix ( 1965 ) 158 -61 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2140 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1773 ). By C5l the /Koppa is replaced by Κ and Ο by Ω , with legends ΚΡΟ , ΚΡΟΤ , ΚΡΟΤΟΝ , ΚΡΟΤΩΝΙΑΤΑΝ , ΚΡΟΤΩΝΙΑΤΑΣ . Types on the later issues include obv . head of Hera Lakinia, rev . seated Herakles (Rutter, HN ³ 2159 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1800 -4 ), both types reflecting the importance of Kroton in the Italiote League (Stazio ( 1983 a ) 390 -94 ). A C4e type with the infant Herakles strangling snakes was also adopted by a number of cities in Asia Minor, reflecting a monetary league or a common use of 'Greek fighting Barbarian' symbolism (Stazio ( 1983 a ) 391 -92 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2157 ; SNG Cop.Italy 1804 -5 ). Bronze coinage was introduced c. 400 (Stazio ( 1983 a ) 394 -95 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2202 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1821 -27 ). Kroton was the metropolis of Kaulonia (no. 55 ) (Ps.Skymnos 318 -19 ), founded in C7s, and of Terina (no. 73 ) (Ps.-Skymnos 306 -7 ), founded at the latest c. 460 ."
57,Kyme (Kymaios),Italia and Kampania,40.5,14.05,2612,13236,"57 . Kyme (Kymaios) Map 44 . Lat. 40 . 50 , long. 14 . 05 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Κυacute µ η , ηasper (Thuc. 6 . 4 . 5 ), spelled Κυacute µ ε on C5f coins ( infra ); the Doric form is Κυacute µ α (ML 29 ( 474 )); it is qualified by τηtildeς ' Ιταλίας at Diod. 11 . 51 . 1 (r 474 ). The city-ethnic is Κυ µ αῖος (C5f coins, infra ; Diod. 11 . 51 . 2 (r 474 )). Kyme is called a polis in the political sense at Thuc. 6 . 4 . 5 (cf. Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 6 . 4 (rC6l)), and it called polis Hel in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 10 (cf. Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 4 . 1 (rC6l); Diod. 12 . 76 . 4 (r 421 )). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested on C5 coins ( infra ). The external collective use is found in Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 4 . 3 (rC6l), Diod. 11 . 51 . 2 (r 474 ) and 12 . 76 . 4 (r 421 ). The external individual use is found in Paus. 10 . 12 . 8 (rHell.). Kyme was the earliest of the Greek colonies in Italy and Sicily (Strabo 5 . 4 . 4 ). The archaeological evidence indicates Greek settlers at Kyme from c. 750 -725 , which is contemporary with the earliest Greek evidence from Pithekoussai, thus suggesting a first settlement phase contemporary with that site (d'Agostino ( 1999 a ) 54 , ( 1999 b ) 207 -11 ). The city was founded by Euboian Chalkis (no. 365 ) (Thuc. 6 . 4 . 5 : Χαλκιδικηgrave πόλις ) or by Chalkis and Eretria (no. 370 ) (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 3 ). According to Strabo 5 . 4 . 4 , there were two groups of settlers: one led by Hippokles from Euboian Kyme,and one led by Megasthenes from Chalkis. Kyme's hinterland was fertile, but the city was a maritime settlement (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 3 . 2 (r 524 / 3 )). There is a tradition of harbour stations in Kymaian territory, such as Dikaiarcheia, which may have been an epineion Kymaion during its early history (Strabo 5 . 4 . 6 (rC8 -C7 ?)); however,at this site mineral extraction may also have played a role (cf. Mele ( 1979 ) 43 -45 ; and Dikaiarcheia in the list of nonpolis sites, supra ). Kymaian territory extended southwards to the site of Parthenope, perhaps originally one of the epineia of Kyme (Strabo 5 . 4 . 7 ; cf. Parthenope in the list of nonpolis sites, supra ). Neapolis (no. 63 ) was probably founded as a C5 colony of Kyme. Kymaian territory extended northwards to the river Klanios, the border between the Greek and Etruscan areas of influence (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 3 . 3 (r 524 / 3 )). The territory comprised c. 280 km ² (Frederiksen ( 1984 ) 68 -69 map 2 ). There is little evidence of sanctuaries in Kymaian territory; however, the Demeter sanctuary on the north-west plateau of Neapolis predates the foundation of this city and may perhaps be taken as evidence of a rural sanctuary in Kymaian territory (E. Greco ( 1987 a ) 488 -89 ), and traditions about the travels of Herakles point to rural sanctuaries dedicated to this hero. The cultural influence of Greek Kyme in the Italic regions should not be underestimated, a salient point being the Euboic-Kymaian origin of the Etruscan alphabet. The political influence of Kyme in Central Italy was considerable already in C6l, as indicated by the embassy sent by Aricia to Kyme asking for help against the Etruscans (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 5 . 1 ). Numerous military confrontations with non-Greek populations are on record (cf. Mele ( 1987 )): in 524 , the city defeated an invading force of Etruscans, Umbrians and Daunians (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 3 ); in 504 , Kyme successfully supported Aricia and defeated Etruscan forces (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 5 ); in 474 , Kyme in alliance with Hieron of Syracuse defeated Etruscans in a great naval battle off Kyme (Diod. 11 . 51 ; cf. ML 29 ); and in 421 , Kyme fell to the Samnites, who subjected the city to an exandrapodismos and resettled it themselves (Diod. 12 . 76 . 4 ), while surviving Kymaians fled to Neapolis (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 15 . 6 . 5 ; Lomas ( 2000 ) 178 ). Analliance with Aricia is attested by Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 5 . 2 (rC6l). An alliance with Hieron of Syracuse is attested by Diod. 11 . 51 . 1 , and this alliance defeated Etruscan forces in the great naval battle at Kyme in 474 (Diod. 11 . 51 . 2 (r 474 ); cf. ML 29 ). Kyme was conquered by Kampanians in 421 , but although the city was subjected to exandrapodismos and resettled with Kampanians, Greek culture survived (Diod. 12 . 76 . 4 ; Strabo 5 . 4 . 4 ), and Ps.-Skylax 10 lists Kyme as a polis Hel . Exiles during the tyranny of Aristodamos are mentioned at Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 10 . 4 . Sending of envoys is attested at Diod. 11 . 51 . 1 (r c. 474 ); reception of envoys is attested at Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 5 . 1 (rC6l). According to Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 3 . 4 , Kyme in C6l, during the conflicts with the Etruscans, raised an army of 4 , 500 foot and 600 horse; the city also possessed a navy at this time (ibid., cf. 7 . 5 . 3 for a navy amounting to ten ships). A hipparches is mentioned at Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 4 . 4 (rC6l).A strategos is mentioned by Dion.Hal. Ant.Rom . 7 . 5 . 2 (rC6l). Information on the C6l constitution and political institutions is found in the account by Dionysios of Halikarnassos of the tyranny of Aristodamos ( 504 -490 ); this account is influenced by stereotypical perceptions of tyranny (Berve ( 1967 ) 160 ), and it is uncertain to what degree the information on the political organisation of Kyme found in it is historical. With that caveat, it may be noted that according to Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 4 . 4 , Kyme before the rise of Aristodamos was an aristocracy (described as an oligarchy at 7 . 6 . 4 ; Ghinatti ( 1996 ) 120 -22 ). Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 4 . 4 -5 refers to a boule (cf. 7 . 5 . 2 ), and a bouleuterion is mentioned at 7 . 7 . 3 . The citizen body is depicted as divided into οιasper δυνατοί and οasper δηtilde µ ος which was ου πολλῶν τινων κυacuteριος ( 7 . 4 . 4 -5 ). At Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 7 . 3 is a general reference to οιasper εν τέλει . After the C6l victory over the Etruscans, Aristodamos emerged as prostates tou demou (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 4 . 5 ) by demagogia , and this implies the existence of an assembly (cf. 7 . 5 . 2 and εκκλησία at 7 . 7 . 5 ). After a successful command in war against the Etruscans in support of Aricia ( 7 . 5 -7 ), Aristodamos launched a coup d'état and took power as tyrant,and,according to Dion.Hal. Ant.Rom . 7 . 8 . 1 , carried out a γηtildeς αναδασ µ οgraveς καιgrave χρεῶν άφεσις etc. as a stereotypical tyrant. After the overthrow of Aristodamos, the patrios politeia was restored (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 11 . 4 ). Death sentences passed by the C6 aristocracy/oligarchy are mentioned in Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 7 . 4 (rC6l). Kyme occupied a high, isolated plateau in the Phlegraian Fields north of Cape Misenum.The settlement was founded on the saddle between the acropolis near the coast and Monte Grillo inland. The Greeks replaced an indigenous settlement, though it is uncertain whether they did so directly or after some hiatus (d'Agostino ( 1999 a ) 61 ). The acropolis and the settlement plateau were fortified from at least C6m, and possibly already from C6e, by a circuit wall built in isodomic ashlars, a double curtain-wall with internal fill (Pagano ( 1993 ); d'Agostino ( 1999 b ) 208 -9 ). Seawards and eastwards along the Monte Grillo the walls exploited the natural steep slopes; to north and south the plateau was accessible from the hinterland and the wall was strengthened and provided with fortified gates, and probably also with an external ditch along the stretch facing Capuan and Etruscan territories (d'Agostino ( 1999 a ) 54 ; Fratta ( 2002 ) 61 ). The walls enclosed an area of c. 80 ha, including the acropolis and part of the Monte Grillo which has revealed some traces of habitation in the Archaic period (Fratta ( 2002 ) 68 ). There are few urban remains from the Greek period, but it is likely that the agora preceded the Roman forum and that the Roman road system followed an earlier Greek system. There is also some evidence of a diateichisma wall dividing the western and eastern city quarters (D'Onofrio ( 2002 ) 136 -40 ). From the description of Aristodamos' homecoming after the victory at Aricia in 504 (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 7 . 1 ) it is apparent that Kyme had at least two harbours. These were probably located below the acropolis, but any evidence has been obliterated by the Roman harbour structures, by silting and by bradyseisms (Paget ( 1968 ) 152 -59 ; Morhauge et al . ( 2002 )). Kyme had other harbour facilities in the bay of Misenum (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 3 . 2 (r 524 / 3 )). Part of the substructures of the Roman 'Temple of Zeus' on the acropolis is from a C5m monumental Greek temple (Burelli and Valenza Mele ( 1989 ) 19 ). The sanctuary of Apollo (Paus. 8 . 24 . 5 ) was located on the lower terrace of the acropolis (cf., however, Clark ( 1977 ) 483 n. 8 ); the only Greek remains are those of the C5stereobate of a peripteral temple (Frederiksen ( 1984 ) 75 ). On the south-eastern slope of the acropolis the subterranean galleries,'Cave of the Sibyl' , is at least in part C6 -C5 , but the function of the structure (an oracular cult, a heroon or tomb) is uncertain (Clark ( 1977 ) 484 , fig. 1 ). The only identified sanctuary on the city plateau is an Archaic shrine in the outermost south-western corner of the city, inside the circuit wall, probably a C7 Heraion (Valenza Mele ( 1977 ) 500 , 524 ; Pagano ( 1993 ) fig. 1 . 2 ; Fratta ( 2002 ) 49 , 69 ). The epigraphic evidence for a Hera cult at Kyme goes back to c. 650 ; she was possibly an oracular divinity with precedence over Apollo ( IGDGG no. 14 ; cf. no. 15 ). The cemeteries are of the utmost importance for the study of Kymaian history (Gábrici ( 1913 )). They define the limits of the city from the C8 , occupying quite an extensive area already from this period,and with single tombs,among the most ancient, found up to 3 km from the city without evidence of smaller Greek satellite settlements. Rich, aristocratic C8l-C7e tombs show close similarities with aristocratic tombs in Eretria, thus revealing close ties between the two cities in a period not long after the foundation of Kyme (Albore-Livadie ( 1979 )). Kyme began striking coins c. 475 . Three weight standards were employed in the early coinage of Kyme, the earliest issues being drachms on the Chalkidian (a single specimen is known) and didrachms on the Euboic-Attic standard (Rutter ( 1979 ) 15 -16 , 91 ; Rutter, HN ³ p. 66 ). The Attic standard most likely derived from Syracuse and may reflect the alliance with Hieron and the establishment of a Syracusan garrison on Pithekoussai in C5f (cf. Strabo 5 . 4 . 9 ; Rutter ( 1979 ) 93 ). Types: obv . lion's scalp flanked on either side by boar's heads; rev . mussel shell; legends: ΚΥΜΕ , ΚΥΜΑΙΟΝ (Rutter ( 1979 ) 9 -10 ; Rutter, HN ³ 513 -14 ). Shortly after the initial coinage,Kyme adopted the Phokaian standard from Hyele; the same types were employed in the different issues. The heraldic motif was probably an allusion to the temple of Apollo where the Kymaians kept the teeth of the Erymanthian boar killed by Herakles (Paus. 8 . 24 . 5 ; Lacroix ( 1965 ) 142 -46 ; Rutter ( 1979 ) 9 -10 ; Rutter, HN ³ 515 ). The type was revived on C5l issues. The lion's scalp is above all known as a Samian type and may reflect Samian participation in the settlement at Dikaiarcheia in C6l (see Dikaiarcheia in the list of nonpolis sites, supra ). T o the same early period are attributed two gold issues: obv . female head, or helmet; rev . on both, mussel shell (Rutter ( 1979 ) 17 -18 ; Rutter, HN ³ 511 -12 ). Later issues of didrachms: obv . lion's scalp and boar's heads; rev . female head, perhaps a nymph personifying the city (Rutter ( 1979 ) 11 ; Rutter, HN ³ 520 ; SNG Cop. Italy 357 ). Smaller denominations are drachms and obols. The rendering of some rev . types reveals Syracusan artistic influence. The most consistent issue has as obv . type the female head (Rutter, HN ³ 521 , 528 , SNG Cop. Italy 358 -68 ). An obv . type of Athena with Corinthian helmet is modelled on Corinthian types and must also reflect Syracusan influence (Rutter ( 1979 ) 11 , 94 -95 ; Rutter, HN ³ 524 ; SNG Cop. Italy 369 ). Nearly all series have a mussel shell as rev . type, though with different secondary motifs such as a crab-of special interest as evidence of Himeran-Akragantine influence or even of an otherwise unknown alliance (Rutter ( 1979 ) 12 , 92 ; Rutter, HN ³ 524 ); rev . legends: ΚΥΜΕ or ΚΥΜΑΙΟΝ . After the Samnite occupation of Kyme, c. 430 -420 , the mint was closed and minting for Kyme and other Kampanian cities was transferred to Neapolis,where coins continued to be struck in the name of Kyme (Rutter ( 1979 ) 8 -41 , 91 -96 ). A public festival is attested for C6l in Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 7 . 11 . 3 . The numismatic evidence ( supra ) suggests cults of Athena, Herakles and Apollo, and possibly the nymph Kyme. Communal oracle consultation in C5e is implied by Ps.-Skymnos 243 . According to Thuc. 6 . 4 . 5 , leistai from Kyme were the original settlers of Zankle (no. 51 ). Neapolis (no. 63 ) was probably a C5foundation of Kyme (Strabo 5 . 4 . 7 )."
58,Laos (La(w)inos),Italia and Kampania,39.45,15.5,1170,6112,"58 . Laos (La(w)inos) Map 46 . Lat. 39 . 45 , long. 15 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 (?). Type: [A]. The toponym is Λαtildeος (Hdt. 6 . 21 . 1 ; Strabo 6 . 1 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 12 (emended, infra )). The cityethnic is ΛαΓaltῖνος or Λαῖνος (C6l coins, infra ). In Ps.-Skylax 12 , under the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , the text [ ' Ελααgrave Θουρίων αποικία ] has been emended to read: ' Ελέα , Λαtildeος Θουρίων αποικία ; if the emendation is accepted, Laos is here classified as a polis type [A] in the urban sense as well as an apoikia . After the defeat of Sybaris by Kroton in 510 but before 494 (Hdt. 6 . 21 . 1 ), refugee Sybarites settled at Laos (a Sybarite colony: Strabo 6 . 1 . 1 and infra ), being τηtildeς πόλιος απεστερη µ ένοι ; whether this implies polis status for Laos is uncertain. Polis in the urban sense is found in Diod. 14 . 101 . 3 (r 390 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4l bronze coins ( infra ); earlier legends employ the nominative singular of the city-ethnic (Guarducci, EG II: 618 ). Laos was a colony of Sybaris (no. 70 .I) (Strabo 6 . 1 . 1 ; see further below on coinage) and refugee Sybarites settled there (and at Skidros) after the Krotoniate defeat of Sybaris in 510 (Hdt. 6 . 21 . 1 ). If correctly emended, Ps.-Skylax 12 ( supra ) describes Laos as a colony of Thourioi (no. 74 ); the text may confuse Thourioi with Sybaris, or it may refer to a C5s refoundation of Laos by Thourioi or more generally to Thourian influence at Laos. The date of foundation is unknown; the terminus ante quem for the existence of the Greek community is c. 510 , when it commenced minting ( infra ). Prior to 510 , Laos may have been an Oinotrian community dependent upon Sybaris and subsequently, from C6l to C5f, a mixed Oinotrian-Greek settlement. The size of the territory of C6Laos amounted to c. 100 km ² when calculated on the basis of the deserted indigenous settlements and of Sybarite influence in the territory from Orsomarso to Grisolia (bordering on the territory of Kerilloi) and including some of the territory on the right bank of the river Lao (E. Greco ( 1995 a )). Diod. 14 . 101 . 3 (r 390 ) seems to describe Laos as a Leukanian settlement, and so Laos may have been conquered by the Leukanians in C5l. The city, however, seems not to have lost its Greek identity completely, and the C4Leukanian town was mixed Greek and non-Greek (E.Greco and Schnapp ( 1989 ) 45 -46 ); if correctly emended, Ps.Skylax 12 ( supra ) lists Laos under the heading poleis Hellenides , and the city issued C4s bronze coins inscribed ΛΑΙΝΩΝ and with both Greek and Leukanian magistrates' names ( infra ). The site of the Archaic city is unknown,but it is here taken for granted that Archaic-C5Laos was located in the vicinity (E. Greco and Schnapp ( 1989 ) 49 -51 ) of C4Leukanian Laos ( infra ). According to Strabo 6 . 1 . 1 , Laos was a river and a polis a short distance from Hyele on the Tyrrhenian coast,but this reference may be to the C4site, even though Strabo describes it as a colony of Sybaris (cf. E. Greco and Schnapp ( 1989 ) 51 ; Caruso ( 1977 )). C4Laos has been identified with the settlement on the hill of S. Maria del Cedro, c. 3 km to the south of the estuary of the river Lao (E. Greco ( 1995 a ); E. Greco, Luppino and Schnapp ( 1989 )). The desertion of the C6 indigenous settlements in the hinterland of Laos was probably the result of Sybarite expansion, and the 'heroon of Drakon'(Strabo 6 . 1 . 1 ) may reflect Greek control over the territory, though the source is late (E. Greco and Schnapp ( 1989 ); E. Greco ( 1995 a ) 71 -73 ). The urban site excavated on the Marcellina hill has not (yet) revealed remains earlier than C4s (E. Greco and Schnapp ( 1989 ) 51 ), and so the history of the Greek city is known primarily from the literary sources and from the numismatic evidence. Diod. 14 . 101 . 3 (r 390 ) suggests that Laos was fortified. Laos initiated coinage c. 510 with issues of incuse staters, drachms and triobols on the Achaian standard (Rutter, HN ³ p. 176 ); the types were based upon the Sybarite bull type with some variations: obv . man-headed bull looking back (river personification), legend: ΛΑΓaltΙ , rev . same type but incuse, and obv . legend completed by ΝΟΣ (retr.), i.e. ΛαΓaltῖνος (the city-ethnic (Guarducci, EG ii. 618 ) and not the locality Laino, as suggested by Zancani Montuoro ( 1949 ); Sternberg ( 1973 ); Gorini ( 1975 ) 13 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2270 -72 ; SNG Cop.Italy 1145 ). Double-relief staters and triobols dating to c. 475 -450 have obv . man-headed bull looking back and acorn in exergue, legend: ΛΑΙ ; rev . similar but no acorn (Sternberg ( 1973 ); Rutter, HN ³ 2275 -76 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1146 -49 ); an issue of triobols and smaller issues carries acorn as rev . type (Rutter, HN ³ 2278 -81 ). The acorn is a type on the triobols of Sybaris (no. 70 .III); see further Rutter ( 1997 ) 43 for connections between the coinages of Sybaris and Laos. An issue of drachms and triobols is dated after 453 : obv . man-faced bull, legend ΛΑΙ , rev . similar (Rutter, HN ³ 2286 -88 ). These types cease in C5m-that is, c. 50 years before the Leukanian occupation. A punch with the type of Sybaris has been found at Laos (unpublished). In C4l, Laos, now a mixed Leukanian-Greek community, issued bronze coins inscribed ΛΑ , ΛΑΙΝΩΝ and with magistrates names (Cantilena ( 1989 ); Rutter, HN ³ 2289 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1150 -51 , 1155 -57 ). A series of C6l double-relief staters have types: obv . Krotoniate tripod and legend ΣΥ ; rev . bull looking back, legend ΛΑΙ (Gorini ( 1975 ) 26 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2273 ). These are attributed by Kraay to Sybaris (no. 70 .II), the Krotoniate tripod revealing the status of Sybaris (no. 70 .II) as within the political sphere of Kroton though partly maintaining its own influence on Laos (Kraay ( 1958 ) 35 ; Parise ( 1982 ) 106 -7 ; cf. Cantilena ( 1989 ) 32 , who sustains the attribution to Laos). An issue of diobols (Rutter, HN ³ 2284 -85 ) may be an 'alliance coinage' reflecting Laos' participation in the refounding of Sybaris (no. 70 .III) in 453 ."

The toponym is Λοκροί , οιasper (Hdt. 6 . 23 . 1 ; Thuc. 6 . 44 . 2 ; IG iv² . 1 95 . 41 ( 356 / 5 ); Ps.-Skylax 13 ), qualified by ( οιasper ) ' Επιζεφυacuteριοι at Hdt. 6 . 23 . 1 , possibly by Hecat. fr. 83 apud Steph. Byz. 419 . 3 , and by Thuc. 7 . 1 . 1 ; at Pl. Tim . 20 A, Λοκρίς is possibly the toponym (so RE vii. 2 . 1304 ). The city-ethnic is Λοκρός ( IvO 144 . 1 ( c. 472 ); Thuc. 4 . 1 . 2 ; Pl.

On onomastics, see further Niutta ( 1977 ) 257 -58 . Lokroi is called a polis in the political sense at Pind. Ol . 10 . 13 , 98 ; Pl. Tim . 20 A, Leg . 638 B; Dem. 24 . 139 , and I.Locri 1 . 1 , etc. (C4m-C3m); and in the urban sense at Thuc. 7 . 35 . 2 and Ps.-Skylax 13 , where Lokroi is the first toponym listed after the heading πόλεις εισιgraveν αιasperacuteδε . A Λοκρῶν πολιτεία was included in the Aristotelian collection of 158 politeia (frr. 547 -48 , Rose; Heracl. Lemb. 60 ); πολιτευacuteεσθαι is found in Arist. Pol . 1273 b 31 , 1274 a 22 . Patris is found in SEG 29 951 (C4 ; CEG ii 835 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4s coins ( infra ) and in I.Locri 9 . 5 (C4m-C3m);the external collective use is found in SEG 11 1211 ( 525 -500 ), cf. Lombardo ( 1989 ) 429 ; SEG 24 304 -5 (C6 -C5 ), 311 -12 ( c. 480 s); Thuc. 3 . 115 . 6 , 4 . 1 . 2 ; Arist. Pol . 1274 a 22 , 1307 a 38 . The external individual use is found in IvO 144 . 1 , 3 ( c. 472 ); IG ii² 3052 ( 328 / 7 ) and Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 43 . Lokroi was founded by Lokrians, but already in antiquity it was debated whether the founders had been West or East Lokrians (Ephor. fr. 138 apud Strabo 6 . 1 . 7 ; Ps.-Skymnos 312 -16 ). The colonists first settled at Cape Zephyrion (modern Capo Bruzzano), but a few years later they moved to a permanent site at the 'hill of Epopis' with the co-operation of Syracusans and possibly of others (Strabo 6 . 1 . 7 ); the passage in Strabo is corrupt, and it is uncertain whether he named others as participating in the relocation; however, Tarentines may have participated, and Pausanias' statement ( 3 . 3 . 1 ) that Lokroi was a Lakedaimonian foundation may be a reflection of (alleged) Tarantine participation (cf. Sourvinou-Inwood ( 1974 ) 189 ; Van Compernolle ( 1992 ) 762 -63 ; see further Bérard ( 1957 ) 199 -209 and Niutta ( 1977 ) 260 -61 ). According to Strabo 6 . 1 . 7 , the foundation took place a little after the foundation of Kroton ( 710 ) and Syracuse ( 733 ), and according to Polyb. 12 . 6 b. 9 at the time of the First Messenian War ( c. 735 -717 ); according to Eusebios at the time of Olympiad 25 . 1 or 26 . 4 ( 679 / 8 or 673 / 2 ). A foundation in the first decades of C7 is now confirmed by archaeological evidence (survey: Sabbione ( 1982 ) 277 -93 ). Perhaps as early as C6m a foundation legend modelled upon that of Taras was in existence; it is discussed by Sourvinou-Inwood ( 1974 ). The name of the territory was ηasper Λοκρίς (Thuc. 3 . 99 , 103 . 3 ). The southern border between the territories of Lokroi and Rhegion (no. 68 ) was marked by the river Halex (modern Galati) (Strabo 6 . 1 . 9 ; according to Paus. 6 . 6 . 4 by the river Kaikinos; cf. Costabile ( 1992 ) 166 -68 ). The river Sagra, theatre of the C6 battle between Lokroi and Kroton (no. 56 ) (Strabo 6 . 1 . 10 ), separated Lokrian from Kaulonian territory; the Sagra is identified with the modern river Allaro near Kaulonia (no. 55 ) or with the modern river Torbido near Gioiosa Ionica (Osanna ( 1992 ) 214 , 222 n. 47 ). The chora of Lokroi comprised at first only the c. 110 km ² coastal plain within the line of foothills of the Sila mountains, although for the moment there is a lack of agrarian structures from the Archaic period that might be associated with Lokroi (Sabbione ( 1982 ) 293 -97 ; Osanna ( 1992 ) 205 -7 ). Lokrian territory soon extended to the borders of Rhegion and Kaulonia, and by C7l-C6e Lokrian dominion extended to the Ionian Sea, where Medma (no. 60 ), Metauros (no. 62 ) and Hipponion (no. 53 ) were founded (Musti ( 1976 ) 108 -20 ; Cordiano ( 1995 b ) 88 -91 ; and the respective entries). In 389 Dionysios I of Syracuse handed over to Lokroi the territory of Kaulonia, whose inhabitants had been relocated to Syracuse (no. 47 ; Diod. 14 . 106 . 3 ); in 388 the inhabitants of Hipponion were relocated to Syracuse, and its territory handed over to Lokroi (Diod. 14 . 107 . 2 ); Skylletion was also handed over to Lokroi (Strabo 6 . 1 . 10 ), and Medma may also have been given to Lokroi ( RE xiii. 2 . 1333 ). Hipponion was lost again in 379 (Diod. 15 . 24 ); and Kaulonia seems to have been refounded c. 357 by Dionysios II of Syracuse, as may be inferred from Diod. 16 . 10 . 2 and 11 . 3 (cf. Plut. Dio 26 . 7 ). A C4m war with the Leukanians is reported in Just. Epit . 31 . 3 . 3 . A kome in Lokrian territory is very likely referred to in FGrHist 577 , fr. 2 . 10 (r 427 / 6 ). A peripolion , i.e. military fortress in the territory, is mentioned in Thuc. 3 . 99 . A C6 alliance with Siris (no. 69 ) is reported by Just. Epit . 20 . 2 . 10 , and a C6 alliance with Rhegion (no. 68 ) by Strabo 6 . 1 . 10 . An alliance with Syracuse is attested by Thuc. 3 . 86 . 2 . A treaty was concluded with Athens (no. 361 ) in 422 (Thuc. 5 . 5 . 2 -3 ); a treaty with Sparta (no. 345 ) in 411 is indicated by Thuc. 8 . 91 . 1 , which attests to Lokrian naval forces serving with the Peloponnesians. After the congress of Gela in 424 , Lokroi sent epoikoi to Sicilian Messana (no. 51 ), which was experiencing a stasis at that point, one faction inviting the Lokrians; the epoikoi were, however, soon expelled, but during their residence Messana was dependent on Lokroi (Thuc. 5 . 5 . 1 ). In 396 , 1 , 000 Lokrians were relocated by Dionysios I of Syracuse to Sicilian Messana (Diod. 14 . 78 . 5 ). The existence of a Lokrian navy is attested by Thuc. 4 . 1 . 2 (ten ships), 8 . 91 . 1 , and Diod. 12 . 54 . 4 (r 427 ) (five ships). A contingent of 300 soldiers is mentioned at Thuc. 3 . 103 . 3 . Late sources report 15 , 000 (Just. Epit . 20 . 3 . 4 ) or 10 , 000 (Strabo 6 . 1 . 10 ) Lokrian troops as having fought in the C6 battle at the Sagra. Polemarchoi are attested in the Lokroi Tables ( I.Locri 21 . 5 (C4m-C3m)). Sending of envoys is attested in Diod. 8 . 32 . 1 (rC6 ); reception of envoys is attested in Diod. 14 . 44 . 6 (r 398 ). F.Delphes iii . 1 176 (prior to 280 ) is a grant of proxeny etc. by Delphi (no. 177 ) to a man described as Λοκροgraveς εκ τῶν ' Επι [ ζε ] φυρίων ' Ιππωνιευacuteς (on which see further Hipponion (no. 53 )). A citizen of Lokroi served as Epidaurian theorodokos in 356 / 5 ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 41 ). A system of three phylai , each subdivided into ten or eleven demes, is attested by the C4m-C3m Lokrian Tables (Jones, POAG 168 -69 ). This system was used to fill boards of officials comprising three members (Jones, POAG 169 ); the eponymous magistracy rotated among the phylai (Jones, POAG 170 ). The existence of phatrai is implied by the existence of a magistrate styled φάταρχος (De Franciscis ( 1972 ) tab . 22 ; Costabile ( 1992 ) 212 ). The constitution of Lokroi prior to the tyranny of Dionysios II ( infra ) is described as an aristocracy in Arist. Pol . 1307 a 34 ff. According to Polyb. 12 . 5 . 6 -7 , nobility was conditional upon being a descendant of the women who had belonged to the ' 100 houses' of the founding Lokrians. In addition to some unspecified archontes , Polyb. 12 . 16 . 6 mentions the office of κοσ µ όπολις , who seems to have been the chief magistrate at the time referred to (Walbank, HCP ad loc .); at Polyb. 12 . 16 . 10 is a reference to the ' 1 , 000 ' , presumably the council (Walbank, HCP ad loc .) or the assembly; since βωλά was the name of the council in C4s ( infra ) and δαtilde µ ος that of the assembly in democratic Lokroi ( infra ), Polybios' information presumably refers to the aristocratic constitution.A gerousia seems to be indicated by Porph. Vita Pythagorae 56 (rC6l), but see RE xiii. 2 . 1347 . A differentiated system of officials for this period is indicated by Pl. Tim . 20 A. Nomophylakes are attested in Stob. 4 . 2 . 19 . In 356 , when Dionysios II was expelled from Syracuse, he found refuge in Lokroi (Just. Epit . 21 . 2 . 9 ); in 352 he became tyrant and ruled Lokroi for six years (Just. Epit . 21 . 3 . 9 ; RE xiii. 2 . 1335 ). In 346 , the Locrians expelled Dionysios, and a severe stasis broke out, which led to the establishment of a more democratic constitution (Arist. Pol . 1307 a 38 ; Strabo 6 . 1 . 8 ; Berger ( 1992 ) 27 ), which is reflected in the Lokrian Tables ( infra ), e.g. in the formula έδοξε ταtildeι βωλαtildeι καιgrave τῶι δά µ ωι ( I.Locri 4 . 7 , etc. (C4m-C3m)). Ephor. fr. 138 (cf. Strabo 6 . 1 . 8 ) states that tradition held the Lokrians to have been the earliest community to employ written laws. The reference is to the code of Zaleukos, who was nomothetes at Lokroi according to Arist. Pol . 1274 a 22 (cf. Iambl. VP 130 , 172 ) and whose activity is dated to not long after the foundation of the city (Gagarin ( 1986 ) 129 -30 n. 27 ). Civic turmoil is reported to have preceded the legal code of Zaleukos (Arist. fr. 555 ; Gagarin ( 1986 ) 58 -59 ). A law, presumably of C4 (cf. νό µ ος εστιgrave ), regulated the conditions under which landed property could be alienated (Arist. Pol . 1266 b 19 -21 ). After the constitutional reforms of the 340 s, the eponymous official was an archon (see SEG 30 1172 ; I.Locri 1 . 1 , etc. (C4m-C3m)). A βωλά is mentioned in I.Locri 1 . 2 , etc. (C4m-C3m). The following boards of officials are attested (all C4m-C3m): επισκευαστηtildeρες ( I.Locri 21 . 2 ), επιστάται ( I.Locri 3 . 13 ), ιasperερο µ νά µ ονες ( I.Locri 2 . 1 ), λογιστηtildeρες ( I.Locri 32 . 7 ), πρόβωλοι ( I.Locri 2 . 3 ), πρόδικοι ( I.Locri 2 . 5 ) and τοιχοποιοί ( I.Locri 3 . 8 ). A φάταρχος is mentioned in I.Locri 8 . 6 and a θευκόλος in I.Locri 21 . 6 (both C4m-C3m). Whether the βασιλευacuteς mentioned in I.Locri 1 . 2 , etc. (C4m-C3m) was a civic magistracy is unresolved ( SEG 45 1443 ). Decrees of the assembly are referred to in I.Locri 2 . 7 , 9 , 10 , etc. (C4m-C3m). A probouleutic procedure is indicated bythe formula δόγ µ ατι βωλαtildeς καιgrave δά µ ω ( I.Locri 2 . 7 , 9 , 10 , etc. (C4m-C3m)) or έδοξε ταtildeι βωλαtildeι καιgrave τῶι δά µ ωι ( I.Locri 4 . 7 , etc. (C4m-C3m)). The literary tradition mentions a first settlement of Lokrians at Cape Zephyrion, but as yet there is no archaeological evidence for such a settlement (Van Compernolle ( 1992 )). After a few years the colonists relocated to the historical site of Lokroi, with evidence of Greek settlers from c. 700 , which fits Strabo's chronology ( 6 . 1 . 7 ) but is earlier than the Eusebian foundation date (Van Compernolle ( 1992 )). According to Foti ( 1976 ) 358 there is evidence of indigenous 'cohabitation'with the Greek settlers, reflecting the tradition of a period of peaceful co-existence found in Polyb. 12 . 5 . 10 (Sabbione ( 1982 ) 277 -98 ). Lokroi was not, therefore, founded on virgin soil, but on the site of an indigenous community ( RE xiii. 2 . 1310 ); C8l contacts between the indigenous population and Greeks are attested by ceramic evidence (Sabbione ( 1982 ) 279 ). The city was founded on the slopes of a mountain ridge,the hill of Epopis according to Strabo 6 . 1 . 7 , with three peaks Mannella, Abbadessa and Castellace (Foti ( 1976 ) pl. 27 ; survey of site: Costamagna and Sabbione ( 1990 )), incorporating the coastal plain between the Portigliola and Ficareto river valleys. It must have had harbour facilities, now possibly identified on the Ficareto estuary ( infra ). The 7 km circuit wall (overall plan in Costabile ( 1992 ) 36 , pl. 13 ) encircled a vast area of c. 240 ha, of which the area south of the 'Dromos'comprises c. 80 ha. The upper part of the city, though enclosed by the circuit wall, is morphologically irregular and not readily accessible for habitation. The extant wall is mainly Heltic, but stretches of it use earlier, C6elements in their structure, particularly in the areas of Centocamere and of the Marasà sanctuary (Barra Bagnasco ( 2000 ) 11 -12 , 30 ); lengths of isodomic structure are dated to C5m-C4m,whereas the curtain-wall in ashlar strengthened with towers is dated to C4m-C3e (Foti ( 1976 ) 346 -49 ; cf. De Franciscis ( 1972 ) 163 -69 on pyrgopoiia in the Lokrian Tables).A siege is reported for C4m by Strabo 6 . 1 . 8 . The vast area encircled by the circuit wall was never fully urbanised. The main zones of habitation comprised the two main urban complexes on the lower plain inside the city wall and the habitation area 'Caruso' in the upper part of the city, where the theatre was also located-possibly in the vicinity of an (unidentified) agora ( infra ). The 'Dromos' , a road of ancient origin apparently preserving the ancient name, divided the city into an upper and a lower part. Extensive habitation areas have been excavated south of the 'Dromos': to the west, the so-called Centocamere with several insulae and a regular, orthogonal layout, and to the east, the insulae near the Marasà sanctuary. The evidence points to a C5e origin, and to two later, C3 phases (for the extensive excavations of the lower city, see Barra Bagnasca ( 1977 ), ( 1989 a , b , c )). Habitation extended up the slopes north of the 'Dromos' (Osanna ( 1992 ) 218 , fig. 16 ). The orientation of the insulae (lengthwise following the slope, the short side facing the sea) facilitated drainage. To the south and nearer the coast-separated from the habitation area of Centocamere by a 14 m-wide plateia -insulae of irregular shape and various systems of drainage, basins and kilns have revealed an industrial and artisan quarter, primarily of C4 (Barra Bagnasco ( 1976 ) 380 -82 , pl. 35 :H 1 -H 3 , 403 -4 ). This area between the city wall and the plateia of the city to the north seems not to have been occupied in the Archaic period, apart from single stoas and the monumental gate; a mercantile agora related to the sea and harbour was situated here in this period (Osanna ( 1992 ) 215 ). The chronological framework of the development of urbanisation is not very clear, but there is testimony of a C6m orthogonal urban organisation of the area between the theatre and the sea, and of the monumentalisation of the sanctuaries of Stoà ad U ( infra ), Marasà Sud, Marasà and Marafioti, a culminating point of urban developmentreflected also in the territorial expansion in this period (Barra Bagnasco ( 1996 a ); Parra ( 1998 ) 314 ). The C6 circuit wall separated the habitation area from the coast, but gates-with monumental drainage conduitssanctuaries and harbour facilities (cf. Thuc. 6 . 44 . 2 ; 7 . 25 . 2 ) outside the city wall were all part of an early, integrated urban layout (Barra Bagnasco ( 2000 )). The richly decorated house and a votive deposit located outside the sanctuary of Aphrodite of Marasà Sud has been interpreted as a hestiaterion or a prytaneion (Barra Bagnasco ( 1996 a ) 57 ; cf. however, Barra Bagnasco ( 1996 b ) 28 -29 identifying it as a sanctuary of Adonis-Aphrodite). The theatre, situated in the upper part of the city, was built originally in C4m, but since it was rebuilt in later periods, its seating capacity of c. 4 , 500 can only tentatively be assumed for the original phase (Parra ( 1977 -78 ), ( 1998 )). It may have served democratic assemblies as well (Costabile ( 1992 ) 322 n. 11 ). Several sanctuaries were scattered across the upper parts of the city and in the lowland areas, primarily in the vicinity of the circuit wall (surveys: Torelli ( 1976 ); Zuntz ( 1971 ) 158 -73 ). The 'Casa Marafioti'Doric temple of 540 -530 , with remains limited to parts of the foundation and foundation trenches (Orsi ( 1911 a ) 27 -41 , 49 -62 ), was situated inside the circuit wall on a spur near the theatre and agora(?), and was part of a larger temenos overlooking the lower city (for an agora(?), theatre and temenos : Parra ( 1998 ) 311 -12 ); the dedicatee of the sanctuary has been identified as Zeus Olympios (which is not accepted unanimously) on the basis of the Olympieion archive found in the vicinity (De Franciscis ( 1972 ); SEG 29 950 ; Costabile ( 1992 )). Votive deposits found near the theatre attest to cults of Athena, Artemis, Persephone,Dionysos and a local hero (Parra ( 1998 ) 315 -17 ). The sanctuary of Persephone, and of Demeter and Aphrodite(?), at Mannella, probably 'the most famous Persephone sanctuary in Italy' mentioned by Diodorus ( 23 . 4 . 3 (r 205 )), is located north of the city, outside the city wall in the Mannella valley (see Torelli ( 1976 ) 158 n. 16 with refs.; Hinz ( 1998 ) 203 -6 ). The sanctuary is above all known from the votive pinakes with the cultic representations of the rape of Persephone, Hieros Gamos , sacrificial scenes, etc. (Prückner ( 1968 ); Sabbione ( 1996 )). An Athena sanctuary with a simple naiskos of uncertain date lies inside the circuit wall at the top of the Mannella hill, which may have formed the acropolis of the city (Orsi ( 1909 ) 323 ; ( 1911 a ) 62 ). The location could indicate a sanctuary of Athena Polias, but the votive terracottas show Athena primarily as a Promachos. The monumental C5 Ionic temple, placed within a larger temenos in the Marasà area in the lower city, can be traced back to C7 (De Franciscis ( 1979 ); Gullini ( 1976 ) 411 -36 ). It has without strong evidence been attributed to Aphrodite (Prückner ( 1968 ) 12 ), but the possible origin of the Ludovisi throne in the sanctuary may support this identification. In the area of the Centocamere, south of the circuit wall, a series of oikoi were laid out so as to form a U-shaped structure (conventionally called Stoà ad U); they formed a single sacred structure, built in C7e with two short wings which were prolonged and enlarged in C6m, on either side of a central space. In the open space inside the wings of the stoa 371 bothroi with remains of sacred meals and some votive material indicate cult activity; C4 graffiti suggest that the sanctuary was dedicated to Aphrodite (Torelli ( 1976 ) 147 -56 ; cf. Musti ( 1976 ) 65 -70 ). A bronze phiale from the Olympieion sanctuary with a dedication to Aphrodite may refer to this or to the Marasà sanctuary (Costabile ( 1992 ) 97 -101 , 113 ). Twenty single square rooms laid out along the south side of the circuit wall, with yet another complex further to the south,are probably part of this extensive C4sanctuary complex (Barra Bagnasco ( 1976 ) 379 -80 , pl. 35 , 'S 1 -S 2 '). An extra-mural sanctuary with remains of a C6l-C5 cult building north-east of the Stoà ad U and south of the circuit wall (Barra Bagnasco ( 1990 b ), ( 1996 b ) 28 -30 ) is attributed to Aphrodite on the basis of dedicatory graffiti and a C5f votive inscription (Barra Bagnasco and Pugliese Carratelli ( 1990 )), and the cult is therefore to be seen in conjunction with the Stoà ad U and the Marasà sanctuary. Votive deposits discovered outside the city by the main route to the eastern cemetery attest a C5 -C4 cult of Zeus (Barra Bagnasco ( 1996 c )) and a sanctuary of Demeter, probably a Thesmophorion, delimited by a temenos wall outside the south-eastern corner of the city wall was in use from C6s (Grattarola ( 1994 ); Milanesio ( 1996 ); Hinz ( 1998 ) 206 -8 ). The cemeteries are located mainly in the middle and lower plain encircling the city at the localities of Vallone di Canale, Contrada Lucifero (with 1 , 676 tombs, primarily C6 : Orsi ( 1909 ) 319 , ( 1913 )), Monaci (with Greek material from C8l-C7e); Parapezza and Tribona (Foti ( 1976 ) 359 -61 ; Osanna ( 1992 )). The patron divinity was presumably Athena, who appeared to Zaleukos in a dream to give him his laws (Arist. fr. 555 ). A local calendar is attested by the Lokrian Tables, which name twelve months and attest to an intercalary month (see Niutta ( 1977 ) 266 ). Communal oracle consultation is reported by Arist.fr. 555 and Aristox. fr. 117 , Wehrli. Several citizens of Lokroi won Olympic victories: Euthykles in 488 ( Olympionikai 180 (pentathlon)), Euthymos in 484 , 476 and 472 ( Olympionikai 191 , 214 , 227 (boxing)), Hagesidamos in 476 ( Olympionikai 218 (boys' boxing)) and Keton in 448 ( Olympionikai 297 (pentathlon)). Eunomos won a Pythian victory in a musical contest (Timaeus ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 43 ). A communal dedication of 525 -500 (cf. Lombardo ( 1989 ) 429 ) with Hipponion (no. 53 ) and Medma (no. 60 ) at Olympia commemorates a victory over Kroton (no. 56 ) ( SEG 11 1211 ). Paus. 6 . 19 . 6 mentions an Archaic communal dedication of a boxwood image of Apollo,possibly in commemoration of the battle of the Sagra ( LSAG 286 ). De La Genière suggests that the archi- tectural remains of the so-called 'Monoptoros of the Sikyonians' at Delphi are the remains of a Lokrian treasury (de La Genière ( 1986 ); Griffin ( 1982 ) 108 too is very doubtful about the traditional attribution of this building to Sikyon). The evidence, mainly iconographic, for a Western Greek origin of this treasury is strong, though the Lokrian candidature must remain hypothetical. Lokroi did not strike its own coins until C4 ; the start of minting is dated with some uncertainty to 375 -350 (survey of Lokrian mint: Pozzi Paolini ( 1976 )). Staters and drachms with Corinthian types and on the Corinthian standard were issued from before C4m to C3e, revealing strong ties with eastern Sicily: obv . Pegasos; rev . head of Athena in Corinthian helmet, legends: Λ , ΛΟ , ΛΟΚ , ΛΟΚΡΩΝ (Pozzi Paolini ( 1976 ) 221 -33 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2336 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1868 -70 ). A contemporary issue of staters on an Italic standard has obv . head of Zeus, legend: ΖΕΥΣ ; rev . seated Eirene, legend: ΕΙΡΕΝΕ (Pozzi Paolini ( 1976 ) 242 -47 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2310 ); this was followed c. C4m by an issue of staters with obv . head of Zeus with unkempt hair and beard, legend: ΛΟΚΡΩΝ ; rev . eagle devouring hare, both types with many variants (Pozzi Paolini ( 1976 ) 247 -52 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2311 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1858 -59 , 1861 -62 ). Later issues have obv . eagle devouring hare; rev . thunderbolt with different symbols and legend: ΛΟΚΡΩΝ (Pozzi Paolini ( 1976 ) 255 -61 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2318 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1865 -66 ). Lower denominations are triobols, diobols and obols (Pozzi Paolini ( 1976 ) 267 -73 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2329 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1860 ). The Lokrian Zeus type may reflect the Syracusan Zeus Eleutherios ( supra ; cf. also Cutroni Tusa ( 1993 -94 ) 478 -79 for Lokrian-Syracusan contacts). At the time of Alexander the Molossian or Pyrrhos, Lokroi also issued a gold coinage, denomination one-tenth of a gold stater on the Attic standard: obv . head of eagle, legend: ΛΟ ; rev . winged thunderbolt (Pozzi Paolini ( 1976 ) 279 -84 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2345 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1857 ). A unique tetradrachm on the Euboic-Attic standard has obv . biga of mules driven by a charioteer crowned by Nike, legend: ΛΟ ; rev . running hare. It has been interpreted as a Messanian-Lokrian alliance coinage of 425 (cf. Thuc. 5 . 5 . 1 ), but see Pozzi Paolini ( 1976 ) 218 -20 for typological and technical anomalies. Bronze coinage commenced c. 350 ; C4s types show mainly Zeus and Athena, C3e also Persephone, Apollo and Herakles (Pozzi Paolini ( 1976 ) 284 -96 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2353 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1871 -98 ). Lokroi was the metropolis of Hipponion (no. 53 ) and Medma (no. 60 ) (Thuc. 5 . 5 . 3 ; cf. Hornblower ( 1996 ) 434 -35 ); the former founded in C7l, the latter in C7 (see further the entries for these two cities). According to Steph. Byz. 437 . 3 , Metauros (no. 62 ) was also a Lokrian foundation; see further the entry for this city."

The city-ethnic is Μεδ µ αῖος in SEG 11 1211 ( 525 -500 ) and presumably at Thuc. 5 . 5 . 3 , where the MSS give Μελαῖοι , which is commonly and probably correctly emended to Μεδ µ αῖοι (Hornblower ( 1996 ) 434 -35 ); Μεσ µ αῖος is found on C4 coins ( infra ). Mesma is one of ten toponyms listed at Ps.-Skylax 12 after the heading πόλεις εισιgraveν ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense. Thuc. 5 . 5 . 3 describes the Medmaians as apoikoi of Lokroi Epizephyrioi. The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4 coins ( infra ); the external collective use is found in SEG 11 1211 ( 525 -500 ), Thuc. 5 . 5 . 3 ( supra ), and Diod. 14 . 78 . 5 (r 396 ). The external individual use has been restored in Hermodorus, De Platone fr. C. iii . 35 , Lasserre (rC4 -C3 ) (cf. Steph. Byz. 440 . 7 with Settis ( 1965 ) 131 ; Philippos of Opous ( FGrHist 1011 ) fr. 1 ; T est. 5 and fr. 15 b, Lasserre). Medma was a foundation of Lokroi (no. 59 ; Thuc. 5 . 5 . 3 ; Ps.-Skymnos 308 ; Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 ), bordering on Lokroi itself (Thuc. 5 . 5 . 3 , supra ). Archaeological evidence points to a foundation in C7 (Paoletti ( 1981 b ) 147 ). The scanty evidence shows very varied relations with the metropolis : (a) SEG 11 1211 ( 525 -500 ) is a dedication by Hipponion (no. 53 ), also a Lokrian colony, Medma and Lokroi (cf. Lombardo ( 1989 ) 429 ) of spoils taken from Kroton (no. 56 ) and thus a testimony to an alliance between colony and metropolis ; (b) Thuc. 5 . 5 . 3 ( supra ) attests to a war between Lokroi and its two neighbouring colonies Medma and Hipponion c. 422 . See further Hipponion (no. 53 ). The foundation of Medma (and Hipponion) was the result of Lokrian expansion across the Aspromonte through the Métramo valley to gain access to the Tyrrhenian Sea by circumventing Rhegion (no. 68 ) and Messana (no. 51 ) at the straits (Bérard ( 1957 ) 209 -10 ; Settis ( 1965 ) 121 -22 ).As a result of Lokrian expansion, the Chalkidian (Zanklaian) site of Metauros on the Tyrrhenian coast near Medma came under Lokrian influence or even occupation (see Metauros (no. 62 )). For the chronology of the Lokrian expansion there is useful evidence from local indigenous sites, such as that from Torre Galli, where the cemetery reveals Greek influ- ence C7l-C6m, which probably coincides with the foundation of Medma and Hipponion (Guzzo ( 1982 b ) 250 ). Studies in the hinterland of Medma have revealed Greek influence from C7l (Cantarelli ( 1974 -75 ) 34 -37 ). The chora of Medma was the Rosarno valley and the lower slopes of the Aspromonte, the crest of these hills dividing Medma from Lokrian territory; in all, the territory measured c. 100 km ² . According to Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 , Medma had a harbour named Emporion , the location of which is uncertain (Settis ( 1989 )), though some locate it at Nicotera (cf. Pontrandolfo ( 1993 )). An alliance between Lokroi (cf. Lombardo ( 1989 ) 429 ), Hipponion and Medma is attested by SEG 11 1211 ( 525 -500 ), a joint dedication by these cities at Olympia of spoils taken from Kroton (Settis ( 1965 ) 122 ). Some kind of treaty with or dependency upon Kroton is probably indicated by C5e Krotoniate coinage with the legend ΜΕ (Settis ( 1965 ) 123 and Gorini ( 1985 ); rejected by Moltrasio ( 1972 -73 ) 175 ; cf. infra ). Thucydides' phrasing at 5 . 5 . 3 ( supra ): οasper προgraveς ' Ιππωνιαtildeς καιgrave Μεδ µ αίους πόλε µ ος , suggests that Hipponion and Medma were allies in the war against Lokroi c. 422 . In 396 , Dionysios I of Syracuse relocated 4 , 000 Medmaians to Sicilian Messana (no. 51 ; Diod. 14 . 78 . 5 ); if this is correct (and it was disputed by, for example, Beloch ( 1923 ) iii. 2 190 ), it probably meant a depopulation of Medma, but depopulation is not supported by the archaeological evidence (Paoletti ( 1981 b ) 150 ). When the populations of Kaulonia (no. 55 ) and Hipponion (no. 53 ) were relocated to Sicily in 389 (Diod. 14 . 106 . 3 , 107 . 2 ), Dionysios handed over their territories to Lokroi (no. 59 ), and it is not impossible that the same happened in the case of Medma ( RE xii. 2 . 1333 ). The figure of 4 , 000 is the only indication of the order of size of the Medmaian population, and if it is historical, it probably refers to the entire population (Settis ( 1965 ) 125 ). The settlement of Medma was located on the site of present-day Rosarno and has therefore been accessible to sporadic investigations only. The ancient site joined a larger plateau by a narrow, easily defendable isthmus. The larger plateau had an extent of about 130 -140 ha,but the urbanised area in its western part comprised only about 30 -35 ha (surveys: Paoletti ( 1981 a ) 47 -54 fig. 8 ; ( 2001 )). There are traces of habitation from the Archaic and Heltic periods, with evidence of C5s urban layout joining habitation areas and sanctuaries (Sabbione ( 1981 a ); Paoletti and Parra ( 1985 )). The C4 remains conflict with the passage in Diodorus describing the C4e deportation of the inhabitants of Medma to Messana by Dionysios I (Diod. 14 . 78 . 5 ; cf. Paoletti ( 1981 b ) 150 ), at least if this passage is taken to indicate complete depopulation. The sanctuaries seem to have been situated on the outskirts of the habitation area (Iannelli ( 1996 )). Most of the archaeological evidence is from votive deposits and not from structural remains (Orsi ( 1913 ); Paoletti ( 1996 c ); Hinz ( 1998 ) 209 -10 ). The votive terracottas are associated above all with the C5f cult of Kore and Persephone. Finds also emphasise the importance of Athena Promachos and possibly Athena Hippia (Orsi ( 1913 ) 100 -7 ; Agostino ( 1996 )). The Athena Promachos could indicate a poliad cult. On the north-eastern edge of the plateau (zone 'S. Anna') outside the urban centre, C6 -C4 votive deposits are evidence of a temenos with a cult of Athena, revealed by figurines of Athena enthroned, and also of Athena Hippia as shown by several horse figurines (Parra ( 1996 a ); Hinz ( 1998 ) 210 ). C3 -C2epigraphical evidence attests a cult of Demeter (Cygielman ( 1980 )). A C5 -C4 cemetery has been investigated on the confining plateau (Lattanzi ( 1988 ) 591 -92 ). Medma began striking coins in C4f, contemporaneously with the metropolis Lokroi Epizephyrioi (no. 59 ). However, an earlier coinage was issued as an ally or dependency of Kroton, probably as early as C5e, as is indicated by two Krotoniate series of staters carrying the legend ΜΕ : the first series has obv . eagle standing on Ionic capital, legend /KoppaΡΟ ; rev . tripod, corn-grain, legend /KoppaΡΟΤ and in exergue ΜΕ (Gorini ( 1985 ) 130 -31 ); the second series, more uncertainly interpreted as a Medmaian-Krotoniate coinage, has obv . head of Hera Lakinia; rev . seated Herakles holding cup, legends: ΚΡΟΤΩΝΙΑΤΑΣ and ΜΕ (Gorini ( 1985 ) 131 ); for the historical context of this coinage, see Gorini ( 1985 ) 128 -33 ; however, for the rejection of such an alliance coinage, see Rutter, HN ³ , p. 168 . Staters of Corinthian type were issued under the influence of Syracuse and Dionysios I from C4m; two types have been documented: ( 1 ) obv . winged Pegasos and monogram of the letters ΜΕ ; rev . helmeted head of Athena (Gorini ( 1985 ) 133 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2424 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1899 ); ( 2 ) obv . winged Pegasos; rev . head of Athena and letter M (Gorini ( 1985 ) 133 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2425 ). Bronze coinage was issued from C4e, the obvs . depicting heads of Apollo and Persephone (?) and the revs . the nymph Mesma or Pan, with various similar types; the obv . or rev . carries the legend ΜΕΣΜΑΙΩΝ (Gorini ( 1985 ) 136 -38 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2426 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1900 -1 ), while some obvs . are inscribed ΜΕΣΜΑ , possibly a reference to the eponymous nymph (Guarducci, EG ii. 626 ). In 525 -500 , Medma, with Hipponion (no. 53 ) and Lokroi (no. 59 ) (cf. Lombardo ( 1989 ) 429 ), dedicated at Olympia spoils taken from Kroton (no. 56 ) ( SEG 11 1211 )."

The toponym is Μεταπόντιον , τό (Bacchyl. 11 . 116 , Maehler; Hdt. 4 . 15 . 1 ; Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 12 ; C5l coins, infra ); Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 12 gives Μέταβον as an earlier name. The city-ethnic is Μεταποντῖνος (Hdt. 4 . 15 . 1 -3 ; Thuc. 7 . 33 . 5 ). Metapontion is called a polis in primarily the territorial sense, with the urban sense as a connotation (Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 12 ). It is listed as a polis in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 14 , where Metapontion is the second toponym listed after the heading πόλεις εισιgraveν αιasperacuteδε . At Bacchyl. 11 . 114 , Mähler, polis presumably refers to legendary times ( infra ). Asty is found in Bacchyl. 11 . 12 , Maehler. The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested abbreviated as ΜΕΤΑΠΟΝΤΙΝ on C6s coins (Rutter ( 1997 ) 28 ); the external collective use is attested in Hdt. 4 . 15 . 2 -3 and Thuc. 7 . 33 . 5 ; and the external individual use in IG i³ 1007 ( 500 -475 ), Syll . ³ 25 (C5m) and Arist. Metaph . 984 a 7 . Metapontion was, according to Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 12 , founded by Achaians (cf. Ps.-Skymnos 326 ff) who had been sent for by the Achaian Sybarites (no. 70 .I) who wanted support against Taras (no. 71 ). Euseb. Chron. Arm . under Ol . 1 dates the foundation to 733 / 2 , but the archaeological evidence suggests a foundation c. 630 ( infra ). The foundation legend was that the site had previously been occupied by a Greek city founded by Nestor and the Pylians on their return from Troy but later destroyed by the Samnitai (Strabo 6 . 1 . 15 ); in, e.g., Bacchyl. Ep . 11 . 114 , Mähler, Achaioi should probably be understood in the Homeric sense as referring to this mythical foundation (Pugliese Carratelli ( 1973 ) 51 ). According to Ephor.fr. 141 , the oecist was Daulios, the tyrant of Krisa; according to Strabo 6 . 1 . 15 , it was Leukippos of Achaia, and this seems to have been the epichoric tradition, since his head is on some C4s coins (Head, HN ² 78 ; Rutter, HN ³ 1552 -53 , etc.). The historicity of this tradition, however, is rendered suspect by Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 19 . 3 , where the trick by which Leukippos obtained the site for his foundation is associated with Kallipolis (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 211 ; see also Mele ( 1996 )). The territory is termed χώρη at Hdt. 4 . 15 . 2 ; Strabo 6 . 1 . 4 names it ηasper Μεταποντίνη , possibly deriving the name from Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 , fr. 3 a); it is the area confined by the valleys of the rivers Cavone and Bradano,calculated to comprise about 200 km ² . The limit of the chora was inland about 13 km from Metapontion at the border fortress at Cozzo Presepe (Osanna ( 1992 ) 54 , 82 ). The area of influence may have been more extensive from C6m (Osanna ( 1992 ) 53 -54 ), when the territory of Siris (no. 69 ) was taken over by the Achaian alliance of Metapontion (no. 61 ), Sybaris (no. 70 .I) and Kroton (no. 56 ) (Just. Epit . 20 . 2 . 4 ). The chora of Metapontion is above all known for the agrarian land division and scattered farmsteads, in evidence from C6s to C4 , over an area of c. 20 , 000 ha (Carter ( 1990 ), ( 1993 ), ( 2000 )). Sanctuaries are attested in the chora of Metapontion from C7m-l. An Artemision (?) is documented at San Biagio (cf. votives and Bacchyl. 11 . 117 , Mähler; Arena ( 1996 ) no. 64 ). A sanctuary of Hera, epigraphically attested (Arena ( 1996 ) no. 75 ), on the border of Tarantine territory has votive material going back to C7m; the temple ('Tavola Palatine') is dated c. 530 . From C6 a number of spring sanctuaries were spread regularly across the territory, probably spaced according to the land division of the chora . The most important are at Incoronata, San Biagio and Pantanello (Osanna ( 1992 ) 40 , 50 , 54 ). The outermost border sanctuary at the site of Cozzo Presepe was monumentalised C5 (Carter ( 1994 )). A war (possibly C5m: Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 210 ) with Taras (no. 71 ) concerning control of territory is attested by Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 12 . On the basis of the seating capacity of the ekklesiasterion ( infra ), the total population of the polis may tentatively be estimated at max. 40 , 000 , of whom some 12 , 500 could be accommodated in the town itself (Carter ( 1990 ) 406 with n. 2 ). Metapontion may have been a member of the Italiote League ( Staatsverträge 230 ). An alliance with Sybaris (no. 70 .I) and Kroton (no. 56 ) in a C6f war against Siris (no. 69 ) is reported by Just. Epit . 20 . 2 . 3 -4 . In C5s, Metapontion was, with Taras (no. 71 ) and Kaulonia (no. 55 ), involved in arbitration between Kroton and returning exiles (Iambl. VP 262 ). A treaty of symmachia with Athens (no. 361 ) is attested in Thuc. 7 . 33 . 5 . Naval forces and akontistai are attested at Thuc. 7 . 33 . 5 . Reception of envoys in C4f is attested in Polyaen. 5 . 2 . 22 . Two citizens of Metapontion are listed as proxenoi of the Aitolian Confederacy in IG ix² 1 . 17 .A. ii . 74 -75 ( c. 260 -230 ). A citizen of Metapontion served as theorodokos of Epidauros (no. 348 ) in 356 / 5 ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 49 ). Sources for the political organisation of Metapontion are scanty, though there is some tenuous evidence of a tyranny by Archelaos at Metapontion in the Archaic period (Berve ( 1967 ) 610 -11 ; Luraghi ( 1994 ) 76 with refs.; for archaeological evidence possibly supporting the tradition of Archelaos' murder, see De Siena ( 1999 ) 234 -35 ). An aristocratic or oligarchic regime at Metapontion may perhaps be inferred from the story that Pythagoras took refuge at Metapontion, where he died (Aristox. fr. 18 , Wehrli). According to Thuc. 7 . 57 . 11 , the Metapontines supported Athens against Syracuse in 413 because internal conflicts ( stasiotikoi kairoi ) left them no other choice (cf. HCT ad loc .); this may mean that in 413 democrats were in the ascendancy (Berger ( 1992 ) 28 ), and democracy may also be implied by the symmachia with Athens mentioned at Thuc. 7 . 34 . 4 . For a possible attestation of an eponymous official (rendered in Oscan as meddix ) in C4e, see Tagliamonte ( 1994 ) 167 -68 . A board of officials called ακοαστηtildeρες is mentioned in Hesych. s.v. A private dedication of C4 -C3e describes the female dedicator as [--] α Πωγ . Θέαντω , where Πωγ . is interpreted as an 'abbreviation of a deme or phyle, referring to the father of the dedicator Θέαντος '( SEG 38 997 comm .). Metapontion was founded on a low plateau near the coast between the rivers Basento and Bradano. C7e evidence has revealed a mixed pre-colonial Greek (Ionic?) and indigenous settlement(s) (cf. De Siena ( 1986 )), whereas the Achaian foundation can be dated to c. 630 (Adamesteanu ( 1982 ) 309 -13 ). A C6m circuit wall with extensive use of sun-dried brick was raised on the edge of the settlement plateau enclosing an area of 140 -45 ha. C5saw some restructuring, and C4 -C3 a strengthening with use of ashlar and reused blocks from older buildings, and a systematisation of drainage canals and city gates (Adamesteanu ( 1973 b) 156 -68 ). A sizeable agora (cf. Hdt. 4 . 15 . 4 ), delimiting the southern side of the large temenos , was part of the urban layout from its earliest phase. The main public monument is the ekklesiasterion /theatre, with a history spanning C7 -C3 . The seating capacity of the C5e structure has been calculated at about 7 , 500 -8 , 000 (Mertens and De Siena ( 1982 )). The interpretation of the structure as an ekklesiasterion is supported by the related,circular meeting places in Akragas and in Poseidonia (Hansen and Fischer-Hansen ( 1994 ) 65 -67 ). The monumental size and the apparently excessive seating capacity imply a use also outside the purely political sphere (Mertens ( 1982 ); Carter ( 1994 ) 182 ). The ekklesiasterion was replaced C4 -C3 by a theatre with a seating capacity of c. 6 , 500 (Paus. 6 . 19 . 12 ; Mertens and De Siena ( 1982 )). A Zeus Agoraios cult is attested by a C6f inscribed stele found near the theatre (Adamesteanu ( 1979 ); the inscription may refer to the function of the ekklesiasterion and not to the agora as such, according to E. Greco ( 1995 b ) 89 -90 ). Other sanctuaries are evidenced by walled enclosures, the larger with two altars, perhaps the sanctuary of Apollo mentioned by Herodotos ( 4 . 15 ); C5 coins depicting Apollo testify to the importance of his cult (Stazio ( 1973 ) 83 -84 ). For the mantineion of Apollo, cf. Theopomp. fr. 248 . There is numismatic evidence of athletic games at Metapontion: the first C5m series of Metapontine doublerelief issues has as rev . type a standing figure of Acheloos, naked and pouring a libation, accompanied by the legend ΑΧΕΛΟΙΟ ΑΕΘΛΟΝ ( infra ). The major urban temenos between the agora and the habitation area was laid out on vast dimensions at the time of foundation or shortly after; later it comprised four major temples and several minor temples or shrines; by C4 it was delimited from the agora by a fence-like structure, from the kerameikos by a drainage canal, and from the habitation zone by a stoa-like building (Mertens ( 1985 )). It was dedicated to Athena (Adamesteanu ( 1976 ) 163 ); an Archaic cippus has the epiklesis [ Hy ] gi [ e ] ias or [ Ai ] gi [ d ] ias (Arena ( 1996 ) no. 68 ; see Graf ( 1981 ) 171 , suggesting a cult of Athena Polias). To Apollo Lykeios was dedicated the C6e 'Peripteral temple A 1 ' , whence comes rich C6e votive material (Adamesteanu ( 1970 ); Arena ( 1996 ) nos. 56 , 57 , 58 ). For Apollo Lykeios Nikaios, possibly referring to a victory over Siris (no. 69 ) in 530 , see Adamesteanu ( 1970 ) 319 and Arena ( 1996 ) no. 60 . Stones shaped as anchors may reflect a cult of Apollo Archegetes (Adamesteanu ( 1974 ) 28 ). It is not known to which deity the C6m 'Peripteral temple B 1 ' was dedicated (Adamesteanu ( 1970 ) 319 -20 ; Graf ( 1981 ) 170 -71 , 174 n. 61 ). The temple was reconstructed c. 540 ( = 'Peripteral temple B 2 '; Adamesteanu ( 1974 ) 27 ; Mertens ( 1985 ) 658 ). The 'Peripteral temple A 2 ' was constructed c. 540 , but the dedicatee deity is unknown.' Oikos C2 ' c. 500 replaces an earlier shrine. C6l-C5e witnessed a monumentalisation of the sanctuary with the C5f 'Temple D'(Mertens ( 1985 ) 661 -63 ), where the cult is again unknown. In addition to Apollo, votives and various inscriptions mention Athena, Hera, Aphrodite, Artemis and Hermes (cf. Graf ( 1981 ) 171 ), and a C5 cult of Demeter is possibly attested as well (Hinz ( 1998 ) 217 ). For urban cults add Zeus Agoraios: Adamesteanu ( 1979 ); Arena ( 1996 ) no. 59 (C6f). For the ∆ιοgraveς ' Αγλα ˜ ο cippus and the reading 'Zeus Aglaios' ,cf.Bottini ( 1989 ) 565 -66 . C5 coin types and votive deposits add further evidence of the cult of Apollo,Apollo Karneios, Demeter, Zeus Ammon, Athena, Hermes, Dionysos and Herakles (Stazio ( 1973 ) 84 -86 ), but also of a number of lesser divinities and, in C4s, the cult of the hero/ oikistes Leukippos (Lacroix ( 1965 ) 85 -89 ). Further epigraphic evidence: C5sherds with graffiti naming Athene (Hygieia?) (Arena ( 1996 ) no. 68 (C5f)); Aphrodite (Arena ( 1996 ) nos. 73 (C6l) and 74 (C5e)); for an inscription naming Hermes, see Adamesteanu ( 1975 a ) 252 . Monumental drains delimiting the agora, kerameikos and temenos are probably C4 ; however, the morphology of the terrain presupposes a system of drainage at least from the C6m (cf. Adamesteanu ( 1975 a ) 247 -48 , 251 -52 ). The overall layout and the delimitation of public spaces were in place by C7s, but the basic elements of the orthogonal town plan are C6m.The degree of development of the individual insulae is not clarified, but a gradual development, as known from most other sites, is probable (Adamesteanu ( 1973 ) 168 -77 , ( 1982 ) 309 -11 ; Mertens ( 1982 ) 104 -7 ). The kerameikos dates back to C6m (F. D'Andria ( 1975 )). About 325 burials have been investigated at Pantanello, c. 3 km north of the city. C6e Greek burials,probably those of the first settlers in the chora , took over the originally indigenous burial place; from C6l the number of burials increased significantly, and the cemetery continued in use until C4 (Prohaszka ( 1995 ); Carter ( 1998 ) 167 ff, 236 ff). The Crucina cemetery, just outside the city wall, contained about 600 burials,including early,monumental chamber tombs, possibly also that of the tyrant Antileon (Carter ( 1998 ) 8 , 26 ; De Siena ( 1999 ) 233 -35 ; for the topography of the cemeteries of Metapontion, see Lo Porto ( 1966 ) 183 -231 ). Communal consultation of the Delphic oracle is attested by Hdt. 4 . 15 . 3 . Bacchyl. 11 , Mähler,celebrates a Pythian victory by Alexidamos in boys' wrestling. Metapontion had a treasury at Olympia (Paus. 6 . 19 . 11 ; cf. Polemo fr. 20 , Pr.). Architectural remains at Olympia and at Delphi have been attributed to Metapontian thesauroi (Mertens-Horn and Viola ( 1990 ) 245 -46 ). An image of Zeus was dedicated by the people of Metapontion at Olympia (Paus. 5 . 22 . 5 ) but cannot be dated.The famous golden harvest dedicated by the Pylian founders at Delphi according to Strabo 6 . 1 . 15 (cf. Courby ( 1927 ) 268 ; Lacroix ( 1965 ) 154 -58 ) has been taken as evidence of a Metapontine communal dedication (Vatin ( 1991 ) 55 -56 , whose readings, however, must be treated with great caution). The coinage of Metapontion began c. 550 , with silver staters in the incuse fabric on the Achaian standard; the type is an ear of barley, though some issues carry secondary symbols such as a grasshopper or a dolphin, and on later issues: ram's head, mule's head and lizard. Legends are ΜΕΤ , ΜΕΤΑ , ΜΕΤΑΠ at times retrograde (Rutter, HN ³ 1459 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1158 -73 ; for the mint, see Stazio ( 1973 ); Noe and Johnston ( 1984 ); Johnston ( 1990 )). The staters were struck in three phases on broad, medium and dumpy flans; smaller denominations were struck in a complex system which provides transitional issues between incuse and double-relief fabrics: drachms, triobols, diobols, obols and a quarter-stater: types: obv . and rev . barley grain, sometimes with revs . ox-head, or head of man-faced bull (Rutter, HN ³ 1487 , 1492 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1174 -81 , Suppl. 42 ). Double-relief coinage was introduced c. C5m; staters: obv . ear of barley; rev . five barley grains forming a star, legends: ΜΕΤΑ , ΜΕΤΑΠ on obv . and rev . respectively (Rutter, HN ³ 1490 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1182 ), followed by issues with obv . types and legends as above, but with divinities as rev . types (cf. Stazio ( 1973 ) 80 -85 for interpretations of these): (a) river-god Acheloos, legend ΑΧΕΛΟΙΟ ΑΕΘΛΟΝ (Noe and Johnston ( 1984 ) 56 -57 , 90 ; Rutter, HN ³ 1491 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1183 (late)); (b) Apollo holding branch and bow (Rutter, HN ³ 1496 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1185 ); (c) Herakles with club over shoulder (Rutter, HN ³ 1495 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1184 ), or Herakles sacrificing at altar (Rutter, HN ³ 1494 ; Noe and Johnston ( 1984 ) no. 312 ). Diobols have obv . as above, rev . head of Acheloos (Rutter, HN ³ 1492 ; SNG Cop . Suppl . 42 ). A new C5l issue of staters has as obv . types heads of divinities (Rutter, HN ³ 1505 ff): Apollo Karneios (or Hermes Parammon or Zeus Ammon), Apollo, Zeus (at times with epithet ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΙΟΣ ), Dionysos, Demeter, and personifications such as Homonoia, Nike, Hygieia and Soteria identified by epithets; rev . ear of barley, legends as above and ΜΕΤΑΠΟΝΤΙΟΝ , ΜΕΤΑΠΟΝΤΙΝΩΝ ( SNG Cop. Italy 1186 -1207 ; Noe and Johnston ( 1984 ) nos. 481 , 495 , 523 -24 for full toponym and ethnic).Some dies were signed, some unusually with the name Aristoxenos in full (Stazio ( 1973 ) 87 ; Noe and Johnston ( 1984 ) 62 -65 ). Lower denominations C5l have obv . ear of barley; rev . crescents and pellets (Rutter, HN ³ 1498 -99 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1230 ); later, from last quarter of C4 obvs . with divinities as above (Rutter, HN ³ 1594 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1231 -38 ). Bronze coins were introduced C5s (Johnston ( 1989 )): obv . tripod, legend: ΜΕΤΑ ; rev . ear of barley (Rutter, HN ³ 1637 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1250 , 1270 ); C4f issues have obv . Hermes sacrificing over thymiaterion; rev . ear of barley, legend ΜΕ and an unusual identification of denomination, ΟΒΟΛΟΣ (Rutter, HN ³ 1639 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1242 ); also bronze coins with obv . head of Nike or Demeter, rev . ear of barley and ithyphallic herm (Rutter, HN ³ 1641 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1243 ). In C4m more silver issues were struck, depicting heads of divinities and personifications as above (Johnston ( 1990 ); Rutter, HN ³ 1554 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1218 -29 ). A reference to the origin of the city is found in an issue of staters and gold coinage with the head of Leukippos (Lacroix ( 1965 ) 85 -86 ; Stazio ( 1973 ) 89 -91 ; Rutter, HN ³ 1552 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1208 -17 ). Gold tetrobols were struck from c. 340 -330 , perhaps at the time of Alexander the Molossian to pay mercenaries: obv . head of Leukippos, or of Nike, legend ΜΕΤΑΠΟΝ (Stazio ( 1973 ) 91 -92 ; Johnston ( 1990 ) 41 -45 ; Rutter, HN ³ 1629 ; SNG Cop. Suppl . 43 )."
62,Metauros (Mataurinos),Italia and Kampania,38.25,15.55,724,3977,"62 . Metauros (Mataurinos) Map 46 . Lat. 38 . 25 , long. 15 . 55 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. The toponym is Μέταυρος (Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 ) or Μάταυρος (Steph. Byz. 437 . 3 ). The cityethnic is Ματαυρῖνος (Steph. Byz. 437 . 4 ). NoArchaic or Classical source calls Metauros a polis . It is included here as a type C on account of Steph. Byz. 437 . 4 , which describes the C6 poet Stesichoros as a native of Metauros: Στησίχορος Ευφή µ ου παῖς Ματαυρῖνος γένος , οasper τῶν µ ελῶν ποιήτης . Stephanos does not provide a source reference, but the fact that Stesichoros was normally considered a Himeraian (cf. Stesichoros TA 33 , 35 -36 , Davies) tends to suggest that he drew this information from a written account and not from memory. If this source really described Stesichoros by the city-ethnic of Metauros (see Musti ( 1976 )), then the city may have been a polis in C6since such use of the city-ethnic often indicates that the site to whose toponym the ethnic is related was a polis (Hansen ( 1996 ) 182 -87 ), especially in external contexts as in this case. Metauros was a foundation either of Zankle (no. 51 ) (Solin. 2 . 11 ) or of Lokroi (no. 59 ; Steph. Byz. 437 . 3 ). As indicated above, the political status of Metauros is highly uncertain, and it is not clear whether we should envisage a river-harbour settlement in Lokrian territory or a polis , at least for a period, founded by Zankle and later subject to Lokroi. The prevailing interpretation takes Metauros to be an originally Chalkidian, i.e. Zanklean, foundation later occupied by Lokroi, at about the time when that city founded Hipponion (no. 53 ) and Medma (no. 60 ), i.e. C7s (De Franciscis ( 1960 ); Settis ( 1965 ) 116 -17 ; Musti ( 1976 ) 88 -89 ). The archaeological evidence ( infra ) suggests a Greek settlement rather than a Heled non-Greek site. The river Metauros delimited the territory of Rhegion (no. 68 ) and Metauros, which may have been founded by Zankle (and Rhegion?, infra ) in opposition to Lokrian expansion,later becoming part of Lokrian territory ( supra ). The territory of Metauros is delimited to the south by the Petracce (river Metauros) and to the north by the territory of Medma. There is indirect evidence of an extra-urban sanctuary 500 m to the south-east of the city (Orsi ( 1902 ), ( 1923 )). Sporadic finds of arulae c. 1 km to the south may indicate another extra-urban sanctuary, though habitation or a cemetery cannot be ruled out (Sabbione and Soverini ( 1950 ) 145 ). Architectural terracottas of a Greek temple have been reported near Gioia Tauro (Gagliardi ( 1958 )). The settlement of Metauros occupied a flat plateau, c. 1 km from the coast and c. 2 km to the north of the river Metauros. The extent of the settlement is unknown: it may have comprised the area of the plateau only, or part of the terrace below as well, but a conservative estimate is that the settlement comprised about 60 ha. De Franciscis ( 1960 ) 59 suggested that the settlement was located on the plain and that the upper plateau was the acropolis of the city; however, the few remains in the lower city are Roman. The settlement was delimited northwards and southeastwards by cemeteries, where a large number of tombs have yielded useful evidence of the cultural connections of Metauros: the C7f-C6 tombs contained mixed Greek and indigenous grave goods indicating a mixed population; the Greek wares reveal ties with the Chalkidian cities of Zankle and Rhegion and above all with Mylai, but overall a wide commercial network is revealed by the tomb material (De Franciscis ( 1960 ); Sabbione ( 1981 b ), ( 1986 )). Later, Greek acculturation was total, and a period of Lokrian influence is revealed by Lokrian and Medmean coroplastic finds and a change in funeral rites (Sabbione ( 1987 ); Cordiano ( 1995 b ) 91 n. 29 ). Burials cease C6l, and very few tombs are known from C5 . Such evidence may point to a termination of settlement C5l-C4e, perhaps due to Leukanian pressure."
63,Neapolis (Neapolites),Italia and Kampania,40.5,14.15,2438,12674,"63 . Neapolis (Neapolites) Map 44 . Lat. 40 . 50 , long. 14 . 15 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 Type: A. The toponym is Νεήπολις (C5 coin, infra ) or Νεάπολις (Ps.-Skylax 10 ; Strabo 5 . 4 . 7 ), ηasper (Dion. Hal. 15 . 6 . 2 (rC4s)). The city-ethnic, always on coins, is Νεοπολίτες , Νεοπολίτης , Νεοπολίτας , Νηοπολίτας , Νευπολίτης , Νουπολίτης , or Νειοπολίτης : see Head, HN ² 39 ; Rutter ( 1979 ) 142 -58 . Νεαπολίτης is found in Diod. 16 . 18 . 1 (r 356 ) and Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 15 . 5 -6 (rC4s). Neapolis is called a polis in the urban sense (Ps.-Skylax 10 ), whereas the sources for polis used in the political sense are late ( SEG 12 378 . 6 ( 242 ); Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 15 . 5 . 1 , 6 . 5 (rC4s)). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C5l coins (Rutter, HN ³ 557 ); the external collective use is found in Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 98 and Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 15 . 6 . 4 (rC4s); and the external individual use in Diod. 16 . 18 . 1 (r 356 ). Neapolis was founded c. 470 on the initiative of Kyme (no. 57 ; Ps.-Skymnos 242 -43 ; cf. Strabo 5 . 4 . 7 ); the date is based on the chronology of Syracusan involvement in Kymaian history and upon evidence from the Castel Capuano cemetery (Frederiksen ( 1984 ) 94 , 101 -7 ; Valenza Mele ( 1993 ) 197 -98 ). The city was subsequently settled also by Chalkidians (no. 365 ), Pithekoussaians (no. 65 ) and Athenians (no. 361 ), taking its name 'Neapolis' only at this time (Strabo 5 . 4 . 7 ; cf. Lomas ( 2000 ) 174 ). Euboian involvement in the foundation, via Kyme or Chalkis, is supported by evidence from the calendar (Trümpy, Monat . 42 -43 ). Exactly how these later arrivals merged with the earlier Kymaian foundation is uncertain (Raviola ( 1991 ) 20 -23 ). Neapolis had a C7 predecessor, Parthenope, but the relationship between the two settlements is not wholly clarified. Parthenope ( Παρθενόπη : Strabo 14 . 2 . 10 ; ethnic Παρθενοπαῖος : Steph. Byz. 504 . 7 ) is called a polis in a late source (Steph.Byz. 504 . 6 ), but its polis status is highly uncertain. Parthenope was probably originally an epineion of Kyme, comparable with the settlement of Dikaiarcheia (see entry in list of nonpolis sites supra ). The identification of Parthenope on the hill of Pizzofalcone, adjoining the later settlement of Neapolis, is based upon evidence from its cemetery with tombs dating to 675 -550 , implying that Parthenope became the district of Palaiopolis when Kyme founded neighbouring Neapolis in C5f, with an as yet unexplained hiatus in the chronology of the early and later settlement (cf. Raviola ( 1990 ) 19 ). The more consistent tradition is that Parthenope was either an apoikia or an epineion of Kyme, and that the site was later destroyed by its metropolis (Lutatius apud Serv. auct. ad Verg, G . 4 . 563 = fr. 7 , Peter; sources: Bérard ( 1957 ) 56 ; Raviola ( 1990 )); but the sources also seem to suggest that the settlement was autonomous during its early history and not just an early stage of the later Neapolis (summary of evidence: Raviola ( 1990 ) 59 -60 ). By C4s the two distinct, neighbouring urban nuclei, Parthenope ( = Palaiopolis) and Neapolis, formed one political community (Livy 8 . 22 . 5 ), suggesting the absorption of the earlier site by the later settlement of Neapolis (cf. Lomas ( 2000 ) 174 ; see further Parthenope in list of nonpolis sites supra ). Neapolis was founded within the Kymaian dominion (cf. Strabo 5 . 4 . 7 ). Its territory was not extensive: c. 20 km ² (Lepore ( 1967 ) 142 , 146 -48 ). The city was a maritime settlement and had a narrow chora bounded by a number of Oscan sites situated not far inland (Polyb. 3 . 91 . 4 ). The city was separated from its hinterland by the river Clanis. Apart from the uncertain evidence of a sanctuary of Athena at Sorrento (Surrento) (Strabo 5 . 4 . 8 ), perhaps reflected in the numismatic evidence (Rutter ( 1979 ) 94 -95 ), extra-urban or suburban sanctuaries are not attested. The Demeter sanctuary of the 'Convento di S. Gaudioso' within the urban area of Neapolis had an Archaic pre-foundation phase and is therefore interpreted as situated in the chora of Kyme prior to the foundation of Neapolis, perhaps demarcating the southern limit of the territory of Kyme (E. Greco ( 1985 a ) 188 -89 ). At some point after the Hieronian teichos on Pithekoussai had been abandoned, Neapolis assumed control of the island (Strabo 5 . 4 . 9 ). Neapolis may have obtained some understanding with Rome as a bulwark against Dionysios of Syracuse (Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 32 ; but see Jacoby, comm. ad loc .); in 327 the city entered into a foedus aequum with Rome (Livy 8 . 26 . 6 ; Staatsverträge 410 ). An alliance with the Samnites in C4s is attested by Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 15 . 5 . 2 . A navy is attested for C4s (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 15 . 6 . 3 ). Reception of envoys is attested in Dion.Hal. Ant.Rom . 15 . 5 . 1 , 2 (rC4s). The presbeis sent by Taras to Neapolis in C4s were proxenoi of Neapolis according to Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 15 . 5 . 2 . Neapolis received refugees from Kyme when that city fell to the Samnites in 421 , according to Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 15 . 6 . 4 ; it is not clear from the text whether the Kymaians were granted citizenship, and the coins struck by the Neapolitan mint in the name of Kyme (Rutter ( 1979 ) 96 ) may indicate that Kymaian identity remained alive at Neapolis (cf. Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 15 . 6 . 4 , reporting the existence of a group of Kymaians at Neapolis c. 327 ; cf. Lomas ( 2000 ) 178 ). At an unknown date (C4 ?), Neapolis, after a stasis , received some Kampanians as synoikoi ; obviously these were granted citizenship, since they were entitled to hold the office of demarchos (Strabo 5 . 4 . 7 ; cf. Livy 8 . 21 ff; Lomas ( 2000 ) 177 -78 ). Neapolis experienced a stasis , presumably in C4 (Strabo 5 . 4 . 7 ). The office of demarchos , at first given only to Greeks, but later to non-Greeks absorbed into the citizenry as well (Strabo 5 . 4 . 7 ; cf. Lomas ( 2000 ) 177 -78 ), may indicate a democratic constitution. A boule , an ekklesia and the procedure of probouleusis are attested for C4s by Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 15 . 6 . 1 -3 (cf. Ghinatti ( 1996 ) 103 -6 ). Neapolis was founded on a sloping coastal plateau, where bradyseism has caused changes to the coastline and hindered an identification of the ancient harbour site. The plateau was fortified by a circuit wall c. 3 . 8 km long and enclosing an area of c. 75 ha; it is a C4 double curtain-wall in ashlar with internal fill, but stretches built in another type of tufa rock and in a different technique go back to the period of foundation c. 470 (Napoli ( 1959 ) 31 -40 ; Fratta ( 2002 ) 68 -69 ). One isolated stretch may testify to a diateichisma wall rather than a C4enlargement of the urban area. The location of the gates of the Greek city is based upon the main territorial routes, the mediaeval gates of Naples and upon the location of the cemeteries (E. Greco ( 1985 a ) 191 -99 ). The layout of the ancient city is clearly mirrored in the city plan of the mediaeval city, one of the most spectacular examples of the survival of an ancient street plan, with three east-west plateiai and about twenty north-south stenopoi clearly revealing the orthogonal urban layout (Castagnoli ( 1956 ) 36 -37 ). The use of long narrow insulae is very similar to the town plans of C5 Himera (no. 24 ) and Naxos (no. 41 ) and therefore possibly comtemporary with the foundation, or slightly later. T o judge from the evidence provided by the street plan as preserved in the mediaeval city, most of the area inside the circuit wall was urbanised; there are, however, no structural remains of habitation, but on the basis of better-known sites, E. Greco ( 1985 a ) 199 -216 estimates two rows of ten houses per insula , with seven or eight inhabitants per house, and hence an urban population of 1 , 000 -8 , 000 inhabitants. The elevated north-western part of the city formed an acropolis-like area which fell outside the regular urban layout and was very likely destined for sanctuaries, as indicated by votive deposits (E. Greco ( 1985 a )). The remains of monumental Roman structures in the upper part of the city adjoining the 'acropolis' provide strong evidence for the location of an upper, probably political agora, and a lower, probably mercantile agora (E. Greco ( 1985 a ) 208 , ( 1985 b )); the Roman theatre of the lower agora ( forum ) probably had a Greek predecessor, but there is no archaeological evidence (Johannowsky ( 1985 )). There is evidence of ephebeia and gymnasia in the Heltic period (Strabo 5 . 4 . 7 ). Rich votive deposits from the area of S. Aniello, mainly C5 -C4 in date and of a type ascribed to Demeter and the chthonic divinities, indicate a major sanctuary with a history going back to a pre-foundation phase situated in the north-western 'acropolis'area of the city (Borriello and De Simone ( 1985 )). A number of literary sources, albeit late, attest the importance of the Demeter cult at Neapolis (Stat. Silv . 3 . 5 . 79 , 4 . 8 . 45 -47 ; Cic. Balb . 55 ). A cult of the Siren Parthenope, the eponymous nymph of Parthenope (on which see the Introduction, supra ), is attested in late sources only, but a cult of her father, Acheloos, is indirectly attested byrepresentation of the river-god on C5 coins (Rutter ( 1979 ) 44 -45 for sources). According to Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 98 , the Athenian nauarchos Diotimos played an important role as instigator of a torch race in honour of the Siren Parthenope at Neapolis (Frederiksen ( 1984 ) 104 -6 ; Raviola ( 1991 ) 24 -27 ; for an overall survey of sources, see Valenza Mele ( 1993 ) 168 , 171 ). The four known cemeteries were situated along the cardinal east, north,west and south/south-west radial roads,with inhumation, cist-slab tombs and tile tombs dating to C5 -C4 , replaced in C4l by cremation tombs (Borriello et al . ( 1985 ) 228 -31 ). The evidence from the cemetery of Castel Capuano confirms the foundation date, with burials from c. 470 (ibid. 232 -74 ). The coinage of Neapolis has been exhaustively treated by K. Rutter, who divides it into four main periods between 450 and 385 (Rutter ( 1979 ) 42 -59 ). Minting began c. 450 (ibid. 46 ) or c. 470 at the time of foundation (Cantilena ( 1985 ); Valenza Mele ( 1993 ) 172 ). The earliest coinage is represented by a single specimen of a didrachm on the Euboian standard: obv . head of Parthenope in profile; rev . forepart of bearded man-faced bull, Acheloos, father of Parthenope; legend: ΝΕΗΠΟΛΙΣ (Rutter ( 1979 ) 46 , 142 ; Rutter, HN ³ 545 ). There are stylistic affinities with the coins of Gela (the rev . type) and Syracuse (the obv . type). C. 450 commenced a more regular issue of didrachms, obols and minor fractions on the Phokaian standard (Rutter ( 1979 ) 46 ). The head of Parthenope, normally shown in profile, at times in three-quarter view (Rutter ( 1979 ) 52 ; Rutter, HN ³ 546 , 552 , 563 ; SNG Cop. Italy 385 ), continues as the most frequent obv . type until the city ceased to coin c. 385 . The rev . has a river-god, either the local stream Sebethis or Sebethos (named on an obol (Rutter, HN ³ 558 )), or perhaps rather Acheloos attested in local myths (Rutter ( 1979 ) 43 -45 ), here represented as a walking bull, at first as in nature, later with a human face or head, at times accompanied by a female figure, probably Nike, flying above and crowning the bull with a garland (an allusion to games held in honour of Parthenope?: Rutter ( 1979 ) 45 ). The rev . has legend ΝΕΗΠΟΛΙΤΗΣ , ΝΕΗΠΟΛΙΤΕΣ or variations, for which see the onomastic section above ( SNG Cop. Italy 386 -94 ). One issue carries the ktetic ΝΕΟΠΟΛΙΤΙΚΟΝ on the obv . (cf. Guarducci, EG ii. 623 ; Rutter ( 1979 ) 47 ; Rutter, HN ³ 546 ). From c. 420 some issues have on the obv . a helmeted head of Athena of Corinthian inspiration (Rutter, HN ³ 554 ; SNG Cop. Italy 382 -83 ), not easily explained in C5s Neapolis, but according to K. Rutter possibly reflecting Diotimos' visit there mentioned by Timaios ( FGrHist ( 566 ) fr. 98 ; cf. Rutter ( 1979 ) 45 , 95 ; Frederiksen ( 1984 ) 104 -5 ; for Athenian settlers at Neapolis, see supra ). Most obols have obv . head of Athena, at times wearing Attic helmet; rev . mussel shell,on early issues, later forepart of man-faced bull, legend ΝΕΟΠΟΛΙΤΕΩΝ and abbreviations thereof (Rutter ( 1979 ) 50 -51 , 58 ; Rutter, HN ³ 548 , 555 ; SNG Cop. Italy 384 ). Neapolis minted coins for the Kampanian Samnite communities: Kyme c. 420 -380 , Capua c. 415 -400 , Hyria 405 -385 , Nola 400 -380 , Allifae 400 -395 , and for the Fistelians 405 -400 and the Fenserni 400 -390 (Rutter ( 1979 ))."

Unlocated (see further Ciaceri ( 1928 )ii. 158 -60 ; Storti ( 1994 ) 331 -32 ); probably near Cosentia in the upper Krathis valley, by the river Acheron (Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 ; coins, infra ); not to be confused with Pandosia in the territory of Herakleia (no. 52 ). Size of territory: ? Type: [A]. The toponym is Πανδοσία , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 12 ; Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 ) or Πανδοσίη (Dodonian oracle apud Steph. Byz. 499 . 19 ). The city-ethnic is Πανδοσῖνος (Classical coins, infra ; IG vii 2225 B. 54 (C2f)). Pandosia is one of ten toponyms listed at Ps.-Skylax 12 after the heading πόλεις εισιgraveν ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense. The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found (as ΠΑΝ∆ΟΣΙΝ ) on Classical coins ( infra ). The external individual use is found in IG vii 2225 B. 54 (C2f). Ps.-Skymnos 326 -29 describes Pandosia (with Kroton (no. 56 ), Thourioi (no. 74 ) and Metapontion (no. 61 )) as an Achaian foundation. Numismatic evidence ( infra ) suggests that the city was a dependency of Sybaris (no. 70 ) and later of Kroton (cf. Mazzarino ( 1963 ) 69 ; Storti ( 1994 ) 332 with refs.). According to Eusebios (Helm 181 ; Schöne 78 ), the foundation of Pandosia was contemporary with that of Metapontion: Ol . 1 . 4 = 773 ; it is not, however, clear whether the reference is to this Pandosia or the one near Herakleia ( RE xviii. 551 ; Storti ( 1994 ) 332 ). In any case, the Eusebian date for Metapontion is unreliable. According to Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 , tradition held that Pandosia was once the royal seat of the Oinotrians. By c. 500 Pandosia with Kroton struck staters on the Achaian standard and with the incuse technique: obv . tripod, legend /KoppaΡΟ ; rev . bull of Sybarite type within incuse square, legend: ΠΑΝ∆Ο (Gorini ( 1975 ) 27 ; Parise ( 1982 ) 105 -6 , 114 ; Stazio ( 1983 b ) 967 -69 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2097 ). The legends and the obv . type suggest dependency upon Kroton, but the rev . type depicting the Sybarite bull suggests earlier dependence upon Sybaris ( RE xviii. 552 : Giangiulio ( 1989 ) 233 n. 67 ). By C5s Pandosia was striking staters of its own in double relief: obv . head of nymph Pandosia, legend: ΠΑΝ∆ΟΣΙΑ ; rev . naked youth offering libation, personification of river Krathis,legend: ΚΡΑΘΙΣ (Rutter, HN ³ 2449 ). C. 400 , staters and thirds depict obv . head of Hera Lakinia; rev . seated, naked Pan with dog, in front herm with kerykeion affixed, legend: ΠΑΝ∆ΟΣΙ , ΠΑΝ∆ΟΣΙΝ , in field mint-mark Φ , similar to mint-marks known from Hyele, Neapolis, Thourioi and other mints (Rutter, HN ³ 2450 -52 )."
65,Pithekoussai (Pithekoussaios),Italia and Kampania,40.45,13.55,1392,7455,"65 . Pithekoussai (Pithekoussaios) Map 44 . Lat. 40 . 45 , long. 13 . 55 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: A. The toponym is Πιθηκουtildeσ ( σ ) α , ηasper (Pherecydes ( FGrHist 3 ) fr. 54 ; Ps.-Skylax 10 ; Ptol. Geog . 3 . 1 . 69 ); Πιθηκουtildeσ ( σ ) αι , αιasper ( Mir. ausc . 833 a ; Strabo 5 . 4 . 9 ). For the change between singular (denoting the main island) and plural (denoting the archipelago), see Coretti and Soverini ( 1990 ) 327 . The city-ethnic is Πιθηκουσσαῖος (Strabo 5 . 4 . 7 (rC5 ?)). Pithekoussai is called a polis in the urban sense at Ps.Skylax 10 , and the external collective use of the city-ethnic is found in Strabo 5 . 4 . 7 (rC5 ?). However, Pithekoussai has often been denied the status of a polis and described as an emporion , i.e. trading station (see Hansen 4 ( 1997 b ) 99 n. 91 ; most recent discussion: Boffa ( 1998 )). Bartoloni and Cordano ( 1978 ) denied polis status to Pithekoussai because: (a) the site is not described as an apoikia and no oecist is named; (b) there is no evidence for a political organisation of the community; (c) there is no evidence of social stratification; (d) though predominantly Greek, the population was of mixed ethnicity. While some of these points, such as the mixed ethnic identity of the population, are irrefutable (Buchner ( 1978 ); Ridgway ( 1992 ) 111 -18 , ( 1998 b ), ( 2000 ) 183 -85 ), others are to a large degree based on absence of evidence, and recent archaeological investigations suggest that the community may not have been exclusively a trading station; for a recent review of the status of Pithekoussai, see Ridgway ( 2000 ) 185 -86 . The following should be noted: - ( 1 ) Some kind of political organisation and social stratification is in fact suggested by Strabo's report ( 5 . 4 . 9 ) of a stasis . - ( 2 ) As Ridgway ( 1992 ) 50 -51 and d'Agostino ( 1999 b ) 213 -17 point out, the mortuary evidence does actually indicate some social stratification. - ( 3 ) A territory seems not to be absent: there is sporadic evidence of C8 -C7 Greek presence over much of the island, which suggests that Pithekoussai had a chora and that the settlement aimed at some agricultural self-sufficiency. The extent of arable land has been estimated at c. 10 -20 km ² (De Caro ( 1994 )). At Punta Chiarito on a promontory on the south coast, c. 12 km from the acropolis of Pithekoussai, two LGI-LGII farmsteads, abandoned c. 680 , were succeeded in C7s by a Greek settlement proper, probably destroyed in C6f by a natural catastrophe (Gialanella ( 1994 )). So even if Pithekoussai may have been primarily a commercial settlement, that cannot be considered to be its only role (see also d'Agostino ( 1999 b ) 218 -20 ). ( 4 ) The urban characteristics of Pithekoussai are no different from other C8 western Greek settlements (for an overall topographical plan, see Buchner and Ridgway ( 1993 ) Carta topografica): Pithekoussai was situated on the island of the same name (Ps.-Skylax 10 ) in the Gulf of Naples facing Kyme and Cape Misenum. The settlement was founded on the promontory of Monte di Vico on the north-west coast of the island, a site defended by natural steep slopes on all sides, and with bays forming natural harbours on both sides. The plateau, relatively flat, formed a habitation area of about 6 ha. Although no habitation structures are extant, sherds found over most of the surface of the plateau testify to extensive C8 habitation (Buchner ( 1975 ) 63 -64 ). There is some evidence of pre-colonial trading contacts (Ridgway ( 1992 ) 107 -8 ; cf. d'Agostino ( 1999 a ) 56 -58 ), but the archaeological data from the 'Gosetti-Akropolis dump' and from the Mazzola excavation date the foundation to c. 750 (Neeft ( 1994 ) 150 n. 9 (' c. 740 '); Coldstream ( 1995 ); d'Agostino ( 1999 a ) 56 -58 ). Surface finds on the Monte di Vico plateau also give evidence of habitation from C6 to C4 , and C6 -C4 architectural terracottas are, with the foundation structures of a temple, testimony of sanctuaries (Coretti and Soverini ( 1990 ) 336 -37 ; Ridgway ( 1992 ) 37 -39 , 86 -87 ). The finds from the plateau and from the 'Gosetta dump' , and from the workshop quarter of Mazzola ( infra ), seem to indicate some interrruption, or at least regression, in the habitation of the site c. 700 -600 , seen by some as evidence of Kymaian domination in this period (d'Agostino and Soteriou ( 1998 ) 368 ). The principal habitation site was on the Monte di Vico,but during the early history of the settlement, habitation also extended along the ridge of Mezzavia and Mazzola, where noteworthy workshops have been excavated (Buchner ( 1975 ); Ridgway ( 1992 ) 91 -101 ). The whole area of Pithekoussai, including the Valle di S. Montano with cemeteries, and the lowland plain, with the probable harbour, between Monte di Vico and the ridge of Mezzavia, comprises about 75 ha (Buchner ( 1975 ) 66 ). Within the first generations after the foundation the population may have risen to 5 , 000 -10 , 000 (Ridgway ( 1992 ) 101 -3 ). Morris ( 1996 ) 57 suggests a minimum population of 4 , 000 -5 , 000 . A vast cemetery occupies the Valle di S. Montano south and south-west of the Monte di Vico, where the c. 1 , 300 C8 -C7 cremation and inhumation tombs investigated correspond to about one-tenth of the estimated extent of the cemetery (Buchner and Ridgway ( 1993 )). In terms of wealth, the cemetery is similar to those known from most other Greek settlements in the West (Buchner ( 1982 ); Ridgway ( 1992 ) 50 -51 ; Neeft ( 1994 ) 154 ). The single find of greatest interest is probably the late Geometric 'Nestor's cup' (C. F. Russo ( 1993 ); Vos ( 1993 )), the earliest (C8s) attestation of the symposion (Murray ( 1984 )). The C5 tombs are few and poor (Buchner and Ridgway ( 1993 )). In the lower city, a sanctuary, possibly a Heraion, is likewise attested by C7l-C6e architectural terracottas from Pastola, between the Mazzola ridge and the sea, west of the acropolis (d'Agostino ( 1994 -95 ) 86 -91 ). A rich C7e votive deposit from the same area has been taken as evidence of a heroon on the assumption that a tomb found there was part of the same complex as the deposit (d'Agostino ( 1994 -95 )). At the very least, this evidence suggests that the political status of Pithekoussai must remain an open question. Little is known of the history of Pithekoussai. According to Strabo 5 . 4 . 9 , Pithekoussai was founded by Eretrians (no. 370 ) and Chalkidians (no. 365 ); Livy 8 . 22 . 6 (cf. Mele ( 1979 ) 32 ) names only Chalkidians. Apart from this, no account of the foundation survives. The settlers found the site unoccupied (Buchner ( 1975 ) 64 ), but mixed marriages-evidenced by,e.g.,fibula typology-may have occurred in a later phase, c. C8l (Buchner ( 1975 ) 77 -80 ; Coldstream ( 1993 )). According to Livy ( loc. cit .), the Chalkidians moved on to Kyme (no. 57 ); however, in the account of the foundation of Kyme by Dionysios of Halikarnassos,Pithekoussai does not appear as a first stage or halting place for the Chalkidian and Eretrian founders of Kyme ( Ant. Rom. 7 . 3 . 1 ). According to Strabo 5 . 4 . 7 , Pithekoussaians participated, with Athenians and Chalkidians, in a resettling of Neapolis at an unspecified date. Hieron of Syracuse constructed a teichos on the island, but the personnel had to abandon it because of seismic activity (Strabo 5 . 4 . 9 ). The island was then taken over by Neapolis, who lost it in an unspecified war (ibid.)."
66,Poseidonia (Poseidoniatas),Italia and Kampania,40.25,15.0,2610,13891,"66 . Poseidonia (Poseidoniatas) Map 45 . Lat. 40 . 25 , long. 15 . 00 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Ποσειδανία , ηasper (ML 10 . 6 -7 ( 550 -525 )); Ποσειδωνία (Ps.-Skylax 12 ; Strabo 6 . 4 . 13 ); or Ποσειδωνιάς , ηasper (Ps.Skymnos 248 ). The city-ethnic is Ποσειδανιάτας (C5f coins, infra ); Ποσειδωνιάτης (Aristox. fr. 124 , Wehrli), or Ποσειδωνιήτης (Hdt. 1 . 167 . 4 ). Poseidonia is one of ten toponyms listed at Ps.-Skylax 12 after the heading πόλεις εισιgraveν ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense, and it is called a polis in the political sense in ML 10 . 7 ( 550 -525 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C5f coins ( infra ); the external collective use is found in Aristox. fr. 124 , Wehrli, and Strabo 6 . 1 . 3 (rC5l-C4e); the external individual use is found in Iambl. VP 239 and 267 (rC6l-C5m), Diod. 11 . 65 . 1 and Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 9 . 56 . 1 (r 468 ). Poseidonia was founded by Sybaris (no. 70 .I) (Ps.Skymnos 249 ; cf. Strabo 6 . 1 . 1 ). According to Solin. 2 . 10 , the city was founded by unspecified Dorians; if historical, these Dorians may have been Troizenians (no. 357 ), since, according to Arist. Pol . 1303 a 30 , Troizenians had participated in the foundation of Sybaris itself (cf. Steph. Byz. 639 . 9 , where Steph. associates the toponym Troizen with Italy and cites Charax = FGrHist 103 , fr. 61 ). The literary tradition offers only a terminus ante quem for the foundation, viz . c. 530 , provided by Herodotos, who at 1 . 167 . 4 refers to the city as in existence when Hyele (no. 54 ) was founded ( c. 540 -535 ). Archaeological evidence suggests a foundation date of c. 600 (E. Greco ( 1981 a ); Poseidonia ii. 73 n. 7 ). At Strabo 6 . 1 . 1 an initial Sybarite settlement distinct from the later city is mentioned and described as a teichos ; the location and status of this teichos is still unsolved (Greco ( 1979 ); Tréziny ( 1992 ); Junker ( 1993 ) 2 -3 ). Suburban sanctuaries of Demeter(?) 3 -4 km to the east of Poseidonia and of Artemis(?) (cf. Diod. 4 . 22 . 3 .) reflect the C6e expansion of the city's influence (E. Greco ( 1987 a ) 480 -81 ). The C6 -C5 chora of Poseidonia was delimited to the north by the river Sele and the important sanctuary of Hera ( infra ), to the east by the foothills bordering the coastal plain, and to the south by the sanctuary of Poseidon(?) at Agropoli (Fiammenghi ( 1985 a )). Other important extraurban sanctuaries of Demeter and Hera are known at S. Nicola di Albanella (Cipriani ( 1989 ); Cipriani and Ardovino ( 1989 -90 ); Hinz ( 1998 ) 176 -80 ) and at Fonte, 14 km from Poseidonia (E. Greco ( 1979 ) 19 ). Greek and indigenous graves respectively mark the boundary of Poseidonian territory c. 14 km to the east of the city. There is evidence of an Archaic Greek rural settlement near the Heraion at the Foce del Sele and of harbour installations on the estuary of the river Sele. The C6 -C5 territory of Poseidonia comprised about 200 km ² (E. Greco ( 1979 ); Greco, Stazio and Vallet ( 1987 )). The most important of the extra-urban sanctuaries was the Heraion located on the left bank of the river Sele (ancient Silaris) close to the estuary, on the northern border of Poseidonian territory (Strabo 6 . 1 . 1 ; Solin. 2 . 7 ). The evidence suggests that the foundation of the Heraion was contemporary with the foundation of Poseidonia (Tocco Sciarelli et al . ( 1989 ) 67 -90 ). On the sanctuary, see Zancani Montuoro and Zanotti-Bianco ( 1951 -54 ); Parise Badoni ( 1989 ); de La Genière ( 1997 b ). The cult of Demeter is attested at several sanctuaries in the chora (Cipriani and Ardovino ( 1989 -90 )). In ML 10 . 7 , a treaty of symmachia between Sybaris (no. 70 .I) with allies and the Serdaioi,Poseidonia is listed as proxenos of the agreement; Poseidonia itself here appears to be outside the Sybarite alliance, and its function as proxenos is not easy to interpret (ML ad loc .); however, the inscription attests the ability of Poseidonia to conduct foreign policy and to enter into interstate relations. According to Strabo 6 . 1 . 3 , Poseidonia had a number of symmachoi in C5l-C4e when the city was defeated by the Leukanians. A war of uncertain date with Hyele (no. 54 ) is attested in Strabo 6 . 1 . 1 . Poseidonia was conquered by the Leukanians in C5l-C4e, probably after the fall of Kyme (E. Greco ( 1992 b ) 249 ). During C4s the Greek identity of the community was effaced, and the Greek language was no longer spoken (Aristox. fr. 124 , Wehrli), but though the Poseidoniatai are described as 'wholly barbarianized' (Aristox. fr. 124 , Wehrli), the persistence of at least one ancient Greek religious festival is reported (ibid.; cf. Ampolo ( 1989 -90 )); in Ps.-Skylax 12 Poseidonia is listed as a polis Hel and Greek-style coinage persisted ( infra ), and Lomas ( 2000 ) 178 questions whether Poseidonia was in fact barbarianized 'to the extent that Aristoxenus would have us believe' . The only evidence for the internal political life at Poseidonia is the C5m ekklesiasterion ( infra ) with its implication of an assembly.A C6l-480 bronze olpe from a tomb in the area of the city (Arena ( 1996 ) no. 32 ) is inscribed with four Greek names, each of which is preceded by two letters ( πα , βυ , δυ bis ); 'the letters preceding the names are sigla identifying the bearers as members of some civic subdivision, whether a phyle, demos or otherwise' ( SEG 43 855 comm .). Poseidonia was founded on an irregular limestone plateau, later bounded by a circuit wall, running for 4 , 750 m and mainly of C4l Leukanian and Roman date (Schläger ( 1962 ); Blum ( 1987 )). There are, however,remains of a Greek circuit wall inside the later walls, east of the south gate (Schläger ( 1962 ) 22 ), and the Greek city probably did have a circuit wall, at least contemporary with the building of the large temples, as indicated by the fact that the north and south gates were laid out in accordance with the orientation of the temples.The extent of the C6 -C5 habitation area,estimated at c. 125 ha, is indicated by several large cemeteries (E. Greco ( 1979 ) 12 -13 ; Pontrandolfo ( 1987 )) and sanctuaries situated along the edge of the urban area (Greco, Stazio and Vallet ( 1987 ); Pedley et al . ( 1993 )). Although the orthogonal urban layout with narrow insulae and the use of plateiai and stenopoi is of Roman date, it was probably Greek in origin, as suggested by the very similar evidence from Metapontion (no. 61 ), also an Achaian colony (Castagnoli ( 1956 ) 39 -44 ; Schläger ( 1965 ) 188 -97 ; E. Greco and Theodorescu ( 1990 ) 87 ). The main divisions of the city were formed by a broad central, civic belt: the agora and the two large temene , dividing the habitation area into two main zones. The public space constituted about 25 per cent of the area inside the walls (E. Greco and Theodorescu ( 1994 ) 236 ). There is no certain evidence of the extent of the C6 habitation, but it probably comprised c. 70 ha of the urban area. The political function of the agora is revealed by an ekklesiasterion and a heroon . The C5m-C4 circular ekklesiasterion had a seating capacity of 1 , 000 -1 , 700 (E. Greco and Theodorescu ( 1983 ) 34 -49 , 79 -81 ; Hansen and FischerHansen ( 1994 ) 69 -72 ). A heroon , or cenotaph, has been recognised in the sunken limestone chamber containing rich grave goods and in C4surrounded by a peribolos wall (Sestieri ( 1955 a ); E. Greco and Theodorescu ( 1983 ) 25 -33 , 74 -79 ). The location of the structure suggests a political cult, possibly that of the oikistes . The small ante-temple located west of the ekklesiasterion possibly housed a poliad cult; the altar in the ekklesiasterion lies on the axis of this temple, thus suggesting some overall planning (E. Greco and Theodorescu ( 1983 ) 65 fig. 8 'T'). The major divinity of the southern temenos was Hera. The main temple was the C6m ' Basilica ' (Heraion I), a Heraion according to the epigraphic evidence (Guarducci ( 1952 ); LSAG 252 , 260 no. 3 ; SEG 29 982 ; Arena ( 1996 ) no. 19 ). Apart from her warrior aspect, she was also kourotrophos (Ardovino ( 1986 ) 107 , 113 ). There were other cults (survey of cults: Ardovino ( 1986 )): Hera Hippia: G. Greco ( 1992 ) 254 -55 ; Hera and Zeus: Stern ( 1980 ); but Hera, the patron deity, enthroned and holding a phiale is the commonest type of votive. The second major temple was the 'Temple of Poseidon'(Heraion II) ( c. 460 -450 ), normally identified as a Heraion, though Torelli ( 1987 ) 60 -62 ) suggests Apollo Hiatros (Cipriani ( 1997 ) 221 -22 suggests Zeus). There were several other structures in the sanctuary already from the Archaic period, e.g. a C6l temple located on the northern edge of the temenos (Bertarelli Sestieri ( 1987 -88 ) 107 -8 pl. 2 ). Votive finds indicate cults of Athena,Aphrodite and Artemis in addition to that of Hera and kourotrophoi , and a number of anatomical votives and the type of 'infant in swaddling clothes' suggest a healing divinity or a Meter (Bertarelli Sestieri ( 1989 )). The stele (a horos ?) of Chiron (C6e) suggests a 'precinct of Chiron'( LSAG 252 , 259 no. 2 ; Arena ( 1996 ) no. 50 . 25 ). A precinct of Zeus Xenios is inferred from a (lost) inscription (Cipriani ( 1997 ) 223 ; Arena ( 1996 ) no. 23 ), and several smaller temples, as well as various altars and votive deposits add to the furnishings of the sanctuary (Sestieri ( 1955 b ), ( 1956 ); Bertarelli Sestieri ( 1987 -88 ); Cipriani ( 1997 ) 215 -16 ; cf. also Mertens ( 1993 ) 93 n. 868 : architectural remains from at least eight different Archaic roofs). The row of altars, various votive deposits, and horoi east of the two large temples indicate the eastern limit of the sanctuary (Bertarelli Sestieri ( 1987 -88 ) 94 -95 , 114 ). There is C6 (?) evidence of a Demeter sanctuary on the southern confines of the Heraion (Cipriani and Ardovino ( 1989 -90 ) 346 with refs.), and the Demeter cult is attested in various locations of Poseidonia (Cipriani ( 1997 ) 222 -23 ; Hinz ( 1998 ) 171 -76 ). Finally there are epigraphic attestations of various cults: of Pais , as an epiclesis of Hera (?), of Athena, Zeus Xenios, Chiron (if not a personal name), and of the nymphs (Ardovino ( 1980 ); Arena ( 1996 ) no. 51 ). A cult of Poseidon must have played an important role in the city, as we can infer from the city's name and from the coin type depicting a striding Poseidon. There is evidence of a Herakles cult in the Leukanian period,but for the Greek period the evidence is uncertain, though there are many references to Herakles myths in the architectural sculptures of the Heraion del Sele (see Cipriani ( 1997 ) 223 -24 , stressing the polis aspect of Herakles cults). In the northern sanctuary there is one major temple, a C6l-C5e 'Temple of Demeter' (Krauss ( 1959 )), and a cult of Athena is inferred from votive material (Sestieri ( 1955 b ) 40 ). A C6f sacellum located to the south of the major temple is the earliest identified temple at Poseidonia, known only from its architectural terracottas (Mertens ( 1993 ) 93 , 127 ). An Aphrodite shrine was probably situated to the north of the Athena temple (Sestieri ( 1955 b ) 40 ), and a C6e naiskos lay between the Athenaion and the agora ( Poseidonia ii. 64 ). The cult of Poseidon must have been important in the first settlement (at Agropolis?; cf. schol. Lycoph. Alex. 724 ) but is not attested in the major settlement except on the coins ( infra ). Important Greek cemeteries occupied extensive areas to the north, south-east and south of the city (Mello and Libero Mangieri ( 1996 ) 332 -33 , 335 -37 ). Parmenides of Poseidonia won both the stadion and the diaulos at Olympia in 468 ( Olympionikai 235 -36 ). Poseidonia began minting silver coins c. 530 -525 with issues in the Achaian incuse fabric, although the weight system used was the 'Phocaean-Phoenician' standard, as at Hyele (see Taliercio Mensitieri ( 1987 )). Drachms, obols and hemiobols were struck in addition to staters (Rutter, HN ³ 1107 ff). The type depicts a striding Poseidon, a trident in his raised right hand; legends: ΠΟΣ , ΠΟΣΕΙ , ΠΟΣΕΙ∆ΑΝΙ (Gorini ( 1975 ) 30 -32 ; Rutter, HN ³ 1107 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1271 -76 , 1294 -96 ). Some coins carry the additional legend ΓaltΙΣΣ , the meaning of which is disputed (Rutter, HN ³ ad 1108 ). The suggestion that it refers to Is, oecist of Sybaris, has won some acceptance (Guarducci, EG ii. 661 ), though it cannot be excluded that the legend refers to an unknown locality implying some sort of league membership (Gorini ( 1975 ) 208 ). The minting of incuse staters stopped c. 510 -500 , perhaps as a result of the destruction of Sybaris, and until c. 470 the city struck only minor denominations (Rutter ( 1997 ) 57 ). C. 470 Poseidonia introduced a doublerelief coinage employing the Achaian weight standard,possibly influenced by refugees from Sybaris (no. 70 .II) (Kraay ( 1967 ) 133 ; Rutter ( 1997 ) 42 ). Types depict obv . Poseidon striding; rev . bull standing; legend: ΠΟΣ , ΠΟΣΕ , ΠΟΣΕΙ , ΠΟΣΕΙ∆ΑΝΙ , ΠΟΣΕΙ∆ΑΝΙΑΤΑΝ (Rutter, HN ³ 1114 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1277 -93 , 1297 -1308 ). Denominations included staters, drachms, diobols, obols, hemiobols and possibly octobols (Rutter, HN ³ 1116 ff). The additional legend ΣΕΙΛΑ on one issue may refer to the river Seilaros/Silaris (?) or, perhaps more plausibly, may read ΜΕΓΥΛ , a name and a possible reference to an otherwise undocumented oikistes (Guarducci, EG ii. 698 -99 ; Rutter, HN ³ 1114 ). Bronze coinage with types of the double-relief silver coinage and continued use of the city-ethnic for the legend ( ΠΟΣΕΙ , ΠΟΣΕΙ∆ , ΠΟΣΕΙ∆ΑΝΙΑΤΑΝ ) starts c. 420 (Grunauer ( 1973 ) 38 ; Rutter, HN ³ 1151 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1309 -23 ). To the later C5 belongs a gold triobol inscribed ΠΟΣ (Rutter, HN ³ 1115 ). The Leukanian conquest did not mean the end of the coinage (Rutter ( 1997 ) 76 -77 )."
67,Pyxous,Italia and Kampania,40.05,15.3,825,4414,"67 . Pyxous Map 46 . Lat. 40 . 05 , long. 15 . 30 . Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is Πυξουtildeς , -ουtildeντος (Diod. 11 . 59 . 4 (r c. 471 ); Strabo 6 . 1 . 1 ; Steph. Byz. 540 . 11 : there described as a polis Sikelias , but mistaken Sicilian locations are not uncommon in Stephanos, cf. Bencivenga Trillmich ( 1988 ) 725 n. 60 . C6s coins inscribed ΠΥΞΟΕΣ (Libero Mangieri ( 1981 ); Rutter, HN ³ p. 143 ) may belong to this city, and the legend may be the uncontracted toponym (so Head, HN ² 83 -84 ; but see further Rutter, HN ³ p. 143 ). Πυacuteξις in Steph. Byz. 540 . 8 , possibly derived from Hekataios, may refer to Pyxous or, more likely, to another site (it is described as εν µ εσογαίηsubiotaη τῶν Οινώτρων ).A city-ethnic is not attested apart from the entries in Steph. Byz. ( 540 . 8 , 10 ). NoArchaic or Classical source calls Pyxous a polis , but it is included as a type B here on account of the following evidence: (a) Diod. 11 . 59 . 4 , where it is reported that it was founded as a polis in 471 / 0 by Mikythos, the tyrant of Rhegion (no. 68 ) and Zankle/Messana (no. 51 ); it may have been founded as a military outpost (Johannowsky ( 1992 )), but the classification suggested by Diodorus may well be correct; (b) the C6s incuse coins (staters and a single specimen of a third-stater) on the Achaian standard depicting the Sybarite bull and inscribed obv . ΣΙΡΙ , ΣΙΡΙΝΟΣ , rev . ΠΥΞ , ΠΥΞΟΕΣ (Gorini ( 1975 ) 9 ; Rutter, HN ³ 1722 , 1727 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1387 ; SNG Cop. Suppl . 53 ). These coins may have been struck by Pyxous under the aegis of Sybaris (cf. Parise ( 1972 ) 102 -4 ) and another community, presumably Siris (no. 69 ) or a community, Sirinos(?), in the vicinity of Pyxous (no. 67 ). The issue has been subdivided into either four series (Libero Mangieri ( 1981 )) or two series (Sternberg ( 1980 ); cf. also Moscati Castelnuovo ( 1989 ) 94 -100 ; Rutter, HN ³ p. 143 ). If the coins were so minted, it follows that Pyxous existed prior to Mikythos' foundation of the site, and that the community was able to enter into close relations with Siris(?) and Sybaris (no. 70 ), of which latter it may have been a dependency. What is less clear, however, is whether Pyxous can be considered a Hellenic community prior to Mikythos' foundation. If Pyxous as founded by Mikythos was indeed a polis , it may have been a failure, for Strabo 6 . 1 . 1 reports that it was left by the settlers πληgraveν ολίγων though he does not specify a date for the depopulation; Pyxous does not appear in Ps.Skylax, pointing to C4m as a terminus ante quem . The C5m indigenous settlement at Roccagloriosa 7 km from Pyxous (Gualtieri ( 1993 )) has been interpreted as a Leukanian replacement of Pyxous. According to Cordiano ( 1995 a ), a new reading of the Olympia inscription SEG 24 103 , previously thought to refer to a conflict between Rhegion and Gela,should rather be taken as evidence of conflicts between Hyele and Rhegion, perhaps brought about by Rhegian expansion and the foundation of Pyxous by Mikythos. The extent of Pyxous'territory is uncertain; prior to the defeat of Sybaris by Kroton, Pyxous would hardly have been autonomous, but rather part of the dominion of Sybaris; as founded by Mikythos, it may have been a dependency of Rhegion. The site of ancient Pyxous is almost certainly to be identified with Roman Buxentum, mediaeval and present-day Policastro, located on a knoll on the left bank of the river Policastro on the Gulf of Laos ( Talaos Kolpos ) (Bencivenga Trillmich ( 1988 ) fig. 1 ). Recent excavations have revealed two phases of the circuit wall of the Greek settlement incorporated in the mediaeval walls: a C5f phase constructed in ashlar with upper structures in sun-dried brick and a C4l phase in a polygonal technique. The walls enclosed an area of about 11 ha,of which perhaps only about 6 ha was used for habitation. There are no other structural remains from the Greek phase; there is evidence of cult activity in the form of fragments of C5 -C4 votive figurines. The C5f phase corresponds well with the tradition of the foundation of Pyxous by Mikythos. However, if Bencivenga Trillmich ( 1988 ) is right in maintaining that there is no material of an earlier period, the site did not have an earlier indigenous or Greek history and cannot therefore have issued the C6l coins discussed above (for a different view, see Johannowsky ( 1992 ))."
68,Rhegion (Rheginos),Italia and Kampania,38.05,15.4,3177,15293,"68 . Rhegion (Rheginos) Map 46 . Lat. 38 . 05 , long. 15 . 40 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A. The toponym is ' Ρέγιον (C5 coins, infra ); ' Ρήγιον , τό (Hdt. 1 . 167 . 3 ; Thuc. 4 . 1 . 3 ; IG i³ 1178 . 4 ( 433 / 2 )). The city-ethnic is ' Ρεγῖνος ( SEG 48 1252 ( c. 550 -500 ); C6l coins, infra ; ML 63 ( 433 / 2 )); ' Ρηγῖνος (Hdt. 7 . 170 . 3 ; Thuc. 6 . 46 . 2 ). Rhegion is called a polis both in the political sense (Thuc. 3 . 86 . 2 , 6 . 44 . 2 -3 ; Arist. Pol . 1316 a 38 ) and in the urban sense (Thuc. 6 . 44 . 3 , Ps.-Skylax 12 ; Heracl. Lemb. 55 ). The Aristotelian collection of 158 politeiai included a ' Ρηγίνων πολιτεία (Heracl. Lemb. 55 ; Arist. fr. 585 , Gigon); αστός is found at Hdt. 7 . 170 . 3 ; πάτρα ( = patris ) is found in IG i³ 1178 . 2 ( 433 / 2 ; cf. CEG i 12 ; ML 63 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on coins from C6l ( infra ). The external collective use is attested in SEG 11 1205 ( c. 500 ), SEG 24 303 -5 (C6 -C5 ), ML 63 . 12 ( 433 / 2 ), Hdt. 7 . 170 . 3 and Thuc. 6 . 44 . 3 ; the external individual use is found in SEG 48 1252 ( c. 550 -500 ), CEG i 388 ( c. 450 -425 ), Arist. Pol . 1274 b 23 and Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 43 . Rhegion was a colony of Chalkis (no. 365 ) (Thuc. 6 . 44 . 3 ; Ps.-Skymnos 311 -12 ; Diod. 14 . 40 . 1 ; Strabo 6 . 1 . 6 ), and Euboian involvement in the foundation is supported by calendar evidence (Trümpy, Monat . 43 -44 ); Peloponnesian Messenians also participated in the foundation according to Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 9 and Heracl. Lemb. 55 . According to Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 9 , the Zanklaians (no. 51 ) sent for the colonists and appointed the oikistes Antimnestos.The participation of Messenian refugees from the First Messenian War dates the foundation to C8s ( CAH ² iii. 3 . 323 -24 ). According to Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 19 . 2 , the city was founded by Artimedes of Chalkis. By the Classical period there existed a well-developed foundation myth (Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 9 ; Heracl. Lemb. 55 ). On the Ionian coast along the river Halex (cf. Cordiano ( 1995 b )) Rhegion was bounded by the territory of Lokroi (no. 59 ), and on the Tyrrhenian coast by the river Petrace and the territory of Metauros (no. 62 ) (Costamagna ( 1986 ) 479 -84 fig. 1 ). The territory is termed γηtilde at Thuc. 4 . 24 . 2 ; its name was ηasper ' Ρηγίνη (Thuc. 7 . 35 . 2 ). The site of Rhegion is perhaps the only site with agricultural resources on the southern Aspromonte, and these were exploited from C7 ; the walled site of Serro di Tavola is interpreted as a C6s phrourion in control of inland routes and the Tyrrhenian coast (Costamagna ( 1986 ) 495 -502 ; Cordiano ( 1995 b ) 83 -88 , 104 -7 ). An extra-urban cult of Herakles is attested by a C5f inscription from Castellace, south of Metauros ( IGDGG no. 41 ; Givigliano ( 1987 ) 95 ; Cordiano ( 1995 b ) 103 -4 ); evidence of a Demeter cult at Grufò Saline Ioniche is offered by a C5s inscription ( IGDGG no. 42 ; for Demeter in Rhegian territory, see Hinz ( 1998 ) 169 -70 ). An estimate of the size of the territory is still largely based upon the evidence presented by Vallet ( 1958 ) 133 -37 , who estimated it at c. 1 , 000 -1 , 300 km ² (cf. Cordiano ( 1995 b )). The influence of Rhegion extended over a much larger area, as shown by the foundation of Pyxous (no. 67 ) c. 476 -465 (Diod. 11 . 59 . 4 ; Strabo 6 . 1 . 1 ) and the pressure on Lokrian territorial aspirations (cf. Cordiano ( 1995 b ) esp. 92 -94 ). Rhegion was presumably a member of the Italiote League ( Staatsverträge 230 ). The city was allied to Lokroi (no. 59 ) at the battle of Sagra in C6 (Strabo 6 . 1 . 10 ), but war between it and Lokroi is attested during the reign of Anaxilas (schol. Pind. Pyth . 1 . 99 a, 2 . 36 c, Drachmann).An alliance with Taras (no. 71 ) in 473 is implied by Hdt. 7 . 170 . 3 , who reports that 3 , 000 Rhegians fell in a battle fought by the Rhegians and the Tarantines against Iapygians (cf. Diod. 11 . 52 . 3 -4 , who calls the Rhegians symmachoi of Taras). IGDGG no. 38 ( c. 450 ) is a kerykeion inscribed ΡΕΓΙΝΟΝ ; ML 63 ( = Staatsverträge 162 ) is a 433 / 2 renewal of an alliance with Athens (no. 361 ) originally concluded in the 440 s; in 415 , however, the city refrained from supporting the Athenian effort against Syracuse (Thuc. 6 . 44 . 3 , 46 . 2 ; Diod. 13 . 3 . 5 ), though it did make a payment to Athens ( IG i³ 291 .b. ii . 19 ( c. 415 )). A symmachia with Leontinoi (no. 33 ) in 427 is attested by Thuc. 3 . 86 . 3 . A peace treaty with Dionysios I of Syracuse was concluded in 399 (Diod. 14 . 40 . 7 ; cf. 14 . 90 . 7 ) and in 389 (Diod. 14 . 107 . 4 ) when the city had to surrender its navy,pay 300 tal., and turn over 100 hostages to Dionysios. Rhegion was taken and destroyed by Dionysios I of Syracuse in 387 (Diod. 14 . 111 -12 ), who sold off as slaves those inhabitants who were not able to raise a ransom of one silver mina . The city was refounded by his son Dionysios II, and a part of the city was for a short period called by the name of Phoibia (Strabo 6 . 1 . 6 ). The independence of Rhegion was restored by Leptines and Kallipos of Syracuse in 351 (Diod. 16 . 45 . 9 ). In C5s, Rhegion experienced a period of stasis (Thuc. 4 . 1 . 3 ), and there were Rhegian phygades at Lokroi urging that city to invade Rhegian territory (Thuc. 4 . 1 . 3 ). According to Hdt. 7 . 170 . 3 , Rhegion lost 3 , 000 men in battle against the Iapygians in 473 (cf. Diod. 11 . 52 . 3 -4 ). An army of 6 , 000 foot, 600 horse and fifty triremes was deployed in 399 (Diod. 14 . 40 . 3 ). In 427 and 425 , Rhegian naval forces assisted the Athenian operations in the west (Diod. 12 . 54 . 4 ; Thuc. 4 . 25 . 2 ). In C4e, Rhegion possessed a navy comprising seventy triremes (Diod. 14 . 107 . 4 ; cf. 14 . 8 . 2 ; 14 . 40 . 3 ), but the city was stripped of its navy by Dionysios I in 389 (Diod. 14 . 106 . 3 ). Appointment of strategoi is mentioned at Diod. 14 . 40 . 3 (r 399 ) (cf. 14 . 87 . 1 (r 394 )), and 14 . 108 . 4 (r 388 ) indicates that such appointments were made by election. Sending of envoys is attested by Thuc. 3 . 86 . 3 (cf. ML 63 . 1 ) and by Diod. 14 . 40 . 7 (r 399 ), 106 . 2 (r 389 ). Reception of envoys is attested in Diod. 14 . 8 . 2 (r 404 ) and 44 . 4 -6 (r 398 ). Diplomatic activity is further attested by the C5m kerykeion ( supra ). Two or more citizens are listed as proxenoi of Tenos (no. 525 ) in IG xii Suppl. 313 . 7 (C3m).According to Arist. Pol . 1274 b 23 , Androdamas of Rhegion at an unknown date (Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 16 n. 27 ) served the Thraceward Chalkidians as nomothetes . A citizen of Rhegion served as theorodokos of Epidauros (no. 348 ) in 356 / 5 ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 47 ). The constitution preceding the tyranny of Anaxilas is described as an oligarchy at Arist. Pol . 1316 a 35 ff. It is presumably this constitution that is referred to in Heracl. Lemb. 55 : it is described as an aristocracy employing the laws of Charondas and administered by 1 , 000 men αιasperρετοιgrave αποgrave τι µ η µ άτων . According to Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 9 , the Rhegian ηasperγε µ όνες ( = the 1 , 000 ?) were all of Messenian genos in this period. In 494 the constitution changed 'from oligarchy to the tyranny of Anaxilas' (Arist. Pol . 1316 a 37 f). Anaxilas conquered Zankle (no. 51 ) and changed its name to Messana (Hdt. 6 . 23 . 2 ; Thuc. 6 . 4 . 6 ); he was then tyrant of both Rhegion and Zankle/Messana (Diod. 11 . 48 . 2 ; Berve ( 1967 ) 156 ): Rhegion was governed by his son Leophron while he himself ruled Zankle/Messana (schol. Pind. Pyth . 2 . 38 ). After the battle of Himera in 480 he concluded a treaty with Gelon and was left in possession of Messana (schol. Pind. Pyth . 1 . 112 ). At the death of Anaxilas in 476 Mikythos succeeded to the tyranny (Diod. 11 . 48 . 2 ) both at Rhegion and Zankle/Messana (Diod. 11 . 59 . 4 ). In 465 the sons of Anaxilas took over power from Mikythos, but they were soon expelled and Rhegion was 'liberated' (Diod. 11 . 76 . 5 (r 461 )). C5s Rhegion went through a period of stasis culminating in 425 (Thuc. 4 . 1 . 3 ; Berger ( 1992 ) 29 -30 ). Four nomothetai are mentioned in Iambl. VP 172 (cf. 130 referring to them as composers of a politeia (r c. C5m): Minar ( 1942 ) 48 , 85 ). A meeting of the ekklesia is attested for 398 by Diod. 14 . 44 . 5 (cf. Arist. Oec . 1349 b 18 ; Ael. VH 5 . 20 ) and again for 345 / 4 (Diod. 16 . 68 . 5 ); for a survey of strategoi and assemblies in C4f, see Costabile ( 1978 ). Rhegion was founded on a narrow sloping plateau near the sea between the river Calopinace (ancient Apsias) and the river Annunciata. It was one of the early Chalkidian foundations, probably founded shortly after Naxos and Zankle ( 730 -720 ) as corroborated by C8l and C7 ceramic finds, structural evidence being absent (Sabbione ( 1981 b ) 275 -81 ; cf. also Spadea ( 1987 )). The harbour was located on the estuary of the ancient Apsias, outside the urban area (Vallet ( 1958 ) 130 -31 ; Martorano ( 1985 ) 234 -36 ). Spadea suggests a harbour location on the estuary of the Fumara dell'Annunciata, below the city and near the recent urban investigations at the Lido (Spadea ( 1986 ) 461 -62 ). The urban layout is largely unknown, apart from the remains of a few public buildings, the location of sanctuaries, and the circuit wall. The course of the early fortification remains uncertain, though part of a C6 -C5 (?) dried brick wall is preserved (Guzzo ( 1982 b ) fig. at p. 129 ). Significant stretches of a C4 double curtain-wall are preserved along the coast and inland along the Aspromonte hills (refs.: Guzzo ( 1982 b ) fig. at p. 130 ; Tréziny ( 1986 ) 192 n. 64 ). It is uncertain whether the wall is earlier or later than the alleged destruction of the city by Dionysios I in 387 (cf. Diod. 14 . 111 -12 ); fortifications are attested by Diodorus before ( 14 . 90 . 5 (r 393 )) and after ( 16 . 45 . 9 (r 350 )) the destruction. The area within the C4 circuit wall comprised about 70 ha, obviously less during the Archaic period if part of the Aspropomonte hills were outside the fortified area. Evidence of public architecture is mostly late. In connection with the ekklesia held by the Rhegians in 344 , on the occasion of Timoleon's visit, a bema is mentioned (Diod. 16 . 68 . 4 -5 ; Plut. Tim . 10 . 1 -4 ; Costabile ( 1978 ) 45 -49 ). Part of a C4 koilon situated on the upper slopes of the city belong to a theatre or an ekklesiasterion ; the diameter of the structure, c. 50 m, gives a seating capacity of about 1 , 500 -1 , 600 . Martorano ( 1985 ) interprets the structure as an ekklesiasterion on the basis of size and features perhaps not compatible with a theatre proper, and P. Orsi ( 1922 ) has interpreted the remains as an odeion , but these interpretations are uncertain (Todisco ( 1990 ) 137 -41 ; Hansen and Fischer-Hansen ( 1994 ) 72 -74 ). Little is known of Rhegion's major sanctuaries. The importance of Apollo at Rhegion is reflected in the foundation myth of the city (Lacroix ( 1965 ); Costabile ( 1979 )) and in the name 'Phoibia' given to a quarter in the city ( supra ). The oldest explicit evidence of a temple of Apollo, however, is a C1l honorary decree ( ILS 5471 ). The location is unknown, but it was possibly in the lower part of the city (Vallet ( 1958 ) 123 -24 , 250 -51 ; cf. Sabbione ( 1981 b ) 278 ). A sanctuary, possibly for the chthonic divinities, was located close to the theatre and proves the public character of the whole area (Vallet ( 1958 ) 121 -23 ). A C5 graffito refers to Zeus Keraunos (Mosino ( 1995 )). According to Thuc. 6 . 44 . 3 , Artemis had a sanctuary outside the city by the coast (see further Vallet ( 1958 ) 79 , 130 -31 ). There are remains of yet another suburban temple, 'de la Marina' (Vallet ( 1958 ) 124 pl. II. 3 (number left out but temple indicated to the southwest of Heltic cemetery no. 10 )). So far no Archaic tombs have been located, all tomb evidence being C4 -Heltic (Spadea ( 1986 )). Communal oracle consultation is reported by Aristox. fr. 117 , Wehrli.Anaxilas was victorious in the mule race in 480 at Olympia ( Olympionikai 208 ) and the cithara-player Ariston participated in the Pythian Games (Timaeus ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 43 ). Rhegion possibly made a communal dedication at Delphi shortly after the abolition of tyranny in 461 ( IGDGG no. 37 ; cf. also 38 : a kerykeion possibly also connected with the abolition of tyranny). At Olympia dedications of weapons commemorate C6 -C5 victories over Lokroi (no. 59 ) and Gela (no. 17 ) (Yalouris ( 1980 ) 15 ; OlBer viii. 102 pl. 48 . 1 ; pls. 36 , 38 ; SEG 24 304 -5 ; IGDGG nos. 33 -34 ). Rhegion commenced its coinage c. 510 with a small issue of drachms on the Euboic standard and in the incuse technique; the type depicts a man-faced bull (probably the river-god of the river Apsias), above a locust; the obv . legend ΡΕΓΙΝΟΝ (retr.) is in the Chalkidian script (C.Boehringer ( 1984 -85 ) 111 -12 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2468 ). The next issue, struck c. 494 at the beginning of the reign of Anaxilas, consists of staters and drachms on the Euboic standard, in double relief, similar to Messanian issues and like them inspired by Samian types: obv . lion mask facing; rev . calf's head and legend ΡΕΓΙΝΟΝ (retr.) (Caccamo Caltabiano ( 1993 ) 17 -18 , 25 -26 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2469 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1923 ). Lower denominations have the same obv . type, rev . ΡΕΓ in dotted circle (Caccamo Caltabiano ( 1993 ) 26 -27 ). A small issue of tetradrachms on the Attic standard, with types as above, were struck c. 485 -480 (Caccamo Caltabiano ( 1993 ) 28 ). C. 480 , still during the reign of Anaxilas, Rhegion and Messana simultaneously struck tetradrachms and fractions on the Attic standard: obv . mule biga; rev . running hare and, on Rhegian coins, the legend ΡΕΓΙΝΟΝ (retr.); lower denominations have obv . running hare, rev . legend ΡΕΓ in dotted circle (Caccamo Caltabiano ( 1993 ) 53 -56 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2472 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1924 -27 ). The abolition of tyrannical rule at Rhegion in 461 led to a new coinage from c. C5m: tetradrachms and drachms with obv . lion mask as above; rev . seated male figure surrounded by a wreath, probably the oecist Iokastos, legendary founder of the city; legend: ΡΕΓΙΝΟΝ , on later issues ΡΗΓΙΝΟΣ (Lacroix ( 1965 ) 44 -45 ; Stazio ( 1978 ) 195 -96 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2477 ff, 2488 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1928 -30 , 1932 (obol)). The revival of coinage at Rhegion has been connected with the appearance of overstruck Athenian tetradrachms in this city and at Messana, reflecting Athenian influence in South Italy and the foundation of Thourioi in 444 (Kraay ( 1976 ) 219 ). The rev . type was changed c. 420 to a head of Apollo, legends ΡΗΓΙΝΟΣ , ΡΗΓΙΝΟΝ , ΡΗΓΙΝΩΝ (Rutter, HN ³ 2494 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1933 -34 ). A later issue with obv . head of Apollo; rev . lion mask (Rutter, HN ³ 2501 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1945 -52 ) is attributed to 356 -351 and the refoundation of Rhegion by Dionysios II, see supra (Kraay ( 1976 ) 22 ). Bronze coinage, with types similar to the silver, was introduced in C5s (Caccamo Caltabiano ( 1979 ); Rutter, HN ³ 2513 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1939 -40 ). Rhegion was the metropolis of Pyxous, founded in 476 -465 by Mikythos (Diod. 11 . 59 ; Strabo 6 . 1 . 1 ; see further the entry for Pyxous)."

(lat. 40 . 10 , long. 16 . 40 ) is not followed here. Barr . locates Siris c. 5 km south of Herakleia Leukania in accordance with one literary tradition which suggests separate locations for the two sites ( infra ). However, in our entries for Siris and Herakleia Leukania we locate both communities on the plateau of modern Policoro, a location suggested by the archaeological evidence and at present widely accepted. Size of territory: ? Type: A. The toponym is Σῖρις , ηasper ( SEG 19 618 (C6 -C5 ); Hdt. 8 . 62 . 2 ); on the name Πολιεῖον ( Mir. ausc . 106 ; Strabo 6 . 1 . 14 ; Steph. Byz. 531 . 12 ), see infra . Σ ( ε ) ιρίτις , which properly denotes the territory, is sometimes used almost as a toponym (Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 12 ; Strabo 6 . 1 . 14 ). The city-ethnic is Σιρίτης (Hdt. 6 . 127 . 1 ); Σιρῖνος of the C6 coin legends may also be the city-ethnic ( infra ): Steph. Byz. 572 . 12 lists this as a form of the ethnic. Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 12 should probably be emended to read δυεῖν ουσῶν πόλεων , τουtilde Μεταποντίου . . . &lt; τηtildeς δεgrave Σιρίτιδος &gt;; if accepted, the text calls Siris a polis in, primarily, the territorial sense, with the urban sense as a connotation. The external collective use of the city-ethnic is found in Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 51 (rC7 ) apud Ath. 12 . 232 C; the external individual use is found in Hdt. 6 . 127 . 1 (rC6f). Siris is implicitly described as patre ( = patris ) in Hdt. 6 . 127 . 1 -4 . The literary tradition presents a number of traditions on the origin, foundation and early history of Siris; the evidence is quite confusing and difficult to correlate with the archaeological evidence (see e.g. Lombardo ( 1986 ); Sacchi ( 1990 ); Osborne ( 1998 ) 265 -67 ). A synthesis yields the following picture. According to Strabo 6 . 1 . 14 , Ionians fleeing from Lydian rule conquered a non-Greek (Chonian) polis and changed the name from Siris to Polieion (cf. Mir. ausc . 106 ; Steph. Byz. 531 . 11 , 572 . 10 ; Etym. Magn . 680 . 11 ), a name that is, however, not often found in the sources relating to the Greek city. Strabo does not specify who these Ionians were or the date of their capture of Siris; but Ath. 12 . 523 C ( = Arist. fr. 601 ) and Timaeus ( = FGrHist 566 , fr. 51 ) identifies them as from Kolophon (no. 848 ), and since Gyges ( c. 680 -645 ) is known to have conquered Kolophon (Hdt. 1 . 14 . 4 ), a synchronisation of the capture of Kolophon and the foundation of Polieion would produce a foundation date of c. 660 (Ronconi ( 1980 ); Lombardo ( 1986 ) 63 -64 ). The historicity of this tradition of a Kolophonian foundation was rejected by Beloch ( 1894 ) 606 -7 , but is accepted by Demand ( 1990 ) 31 -33 ; a C6e-m loom weight inscribed in the Ionian alphabet may possibly support an Ionian presence at Siris ( LSAG 286 ). The foundation date of c. 660 implied by the synchronisation with Gyges' capture of Kolophon does not square well with the archaeological evidence, which points to a foundation date of C8l-C7e. Strabo's report ( 6 . 1 . 14 ) that Siris was a Rhodian foundation is unique. According to Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 12 , Sybaris (no. 70 .I) invited Achaian colonists to settle in Italy to create a buffer against Taras (no. 71 ); two sites were at the disposal of the settlers, Metapontion and Siris, and the Sybarites advised settling Metapontion since the new community would then also control Siris. This seems to imply that Siris lay empty or was controlled by Sybaris; Just. Epit . 20 . 2 . 4 reports that an alliance of Metapontion (no. 61 ), Sybaris ( 70 .I) and Kroton (no. 56 ) conquered Siris, and this would seem the probable occasion after which Sybaris could control Siris; this conquest is usually dated to C6f (Giangiulio ( 1989 ) 249 -50 ; Sacchi ( 1990 ) 151 ) and archaeological evidence confirms a c. C6m destruction of Siris (Adamesteanu ( 1975 b ) 527 ). But Metapontion seems to have been founded c. 630 (see the entry for Metapontion), and in any case the city can hardly have participated in the war that provided the preconditions for its own foundation.This combination of the evidence, then, runs into difficulties. Furthermore, Siris seems to have existed and minted coins in C6l ( infra ), and with legends in Achaian script. According to Just. Epit . 20 . 2 . 10 , Siris was allied to Lokroi (no. 59 ) during the conflict with Metapontion, Sybaris and Kroton. Though Hdt. 8 . 62 . 1 may imply that Siris was unoccupied in C5e, it does seem to have been occupied when Taras (no. 71 ) and Thourioi (no. 74 ) fought for control of the site shortly after the foundation of Thourioi; the war was ended by a mutual agreement between the two cities to found a joint colony (Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 11 ; Staatsverträge 158 ). Diod. 12 . 36 . 4 dates the foundation of this colony to 433 / 2 , and he reports that it was founded at the site of Siris, whose inhabitants were deported. According to Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 11 , 'Herakleia'was not the original name of the colony: the city was thus named only after having changed its initial location.A combination of Diodorus and Antiochos would suggest that the city was originally founded as Siris on the site of Siris, but later relocated and then named Herakleia; such a reconstruction is not, however, supported by the archaeological evidence, which clearly shows Herakleia to have occupied the site identified with Siris (see further the entry for Herakleia). According to Strabo 6 . 1 . 14 , Siris served as the epineion of Herakleia, but the reference here is not to the historical Greek Siris, but to a legendary Siris, a polis Troike , of which there are no archaeological remains. So, by the 430 s Siris had been replaced by Herakleia (no. 52 ). The territory is called Σ ( ε ) ιρίτις (Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 3 ; Arist. Pol . 1329 b 21 ). The sources refer to a foundation near the river Siris, but there is no archaeological evidence for such a site, and Siris is therefore normally identified with the settlement on the hill of Policoro ( infra ). The archaeological evidence indicates Greek settlers on the plateau of Policoro from C8l, and the Kolophonian settlers ( supra ) therefore had Greek predecessors.Greek presence in the Siritis from the C8s has been documented at other sites also, most importantly at Incoronata c. 18 km to the north of Siris. Incoronata had a cultural appearance very similar to that of Siris, and the site is therefore interpreted as an emporion of this city, located on the northern border of Sirite territory (Orlandini ( 1986 a ), ( 1986 b )); it was destroyed by Metapontion (no. 61 ) at the time of the foundation of that city c. 630 (Osanna ( 1992 ) 40 -42 ; Sacchi ( 1990 ) esp. 146 -59 ). Ionian influence was curtailed by the foundation of Metapontion and so confined within the valley of the river Cavone from C7s. The northern border of Siris' territory centred upon the Heled indigenous settlement at Termitito (Osanna ( 1992 ) 94 ). The chora of Siris extended along the coast and somewhat inland along the Sinni and Agri river valleys, as attested by the border sites of S. Maria d'Anglona and Piano Sollazzo, which are Heled from C7s, but the influence of Siris undoubtedly reached the Tyrrhenian coast (Osanna ( 1992 ) 92 -96 , 109 -10 ). To the south the territory was bounded by the Siris valley and beyond that by Sybarite territory. There is no evidence of sanctuaries in the territory of Siris prior to the foundation of Herakleia (Osanna ( 1992 ) 96 ). The C8l-C7e settlement founded on the narrow, coastal east-west oriented plateau ( c. 1 , 700 × 100 / 150 m), modern Policoro, is here identified with Siris. The easternmost part of the plateau was fortified on its west side by a ditch and forms an acropolis (Hänsel ( 1973 ) 401 -4 fig. 1 , 429 -41 , 443 -46 , 461 -63 ). Remains of C7 -C6mudbrick circuit walls along the edge of the Policoro plateau (Hänsel ( 1973 ) 429 -43 , 492 ; Adamesteanu ( 1980 b ) 82 -85 ) show that habitation, although concentrated in separate areas, covered most of the plateau. The sporadic structural remains on the plateau (Adamesteanu and Dilthey ( 1978 ) 521 -25 fig. 12 ) and ashlar foundations of two large structures (temples?) on the acropolis date from c. 700 (Adamesteanu ( 1980 b ) 76 -78 ). There are traces of habitation and workshops also outside and south of the plateau; the location of several cemeteries seems to indicate separate nuclei of habitation areas (Tagliente ( 1986 a ), ( 1986 b )). The archaeological evidence confirms a destruction c. C6m ( = the Achaian conquest of Just. Epit . 20 . 3 . 4 ?), but there are also some signs of continuous settlement (Adamesteanu ( 1975 b ) 527 ). The vast C5 public area, an agora(?), on the southern slope above the sanctuary of the 'Archaic Temple' , may have had an Archaic origin. Sanctuaries were located at springs rising on the southern slope of the plateau. The sanctuary of Demeter identified by C5 -C4epigraphic evidence (Neutsch ( 1967 ) 134-36 , ( 1980 )) originated in C8l-C7e (Adamesteanu ( 1980 b ) 78 n. 24 , 86 -87 with refs.; ( 1982 ) 301 , 303 fig. 2 ; for scepticism on the evidence, see Hinz ( 1998 ) 193 -94 ). The divinity of the C6e ' Archaic T emple' to the west of the Demeter sanctuary is unknown; cult was practised from C7m (Adamesteanu ( 1974 ) 97 , ( 1980 b ) 87 -88 ; Mertens-Horn and Viola ( 1990 ) 249 -50 ). Further west, yet another sanctuary with remains of two or three C6l naiskoi and votive material testify to the overall public character of the southern slope of the plateau. The cult is uncertain, though a votive pinax found on the site with a representation of Apollo and Herakles may point to these divinities (Neutsch ( 1980 ) 153 -54 ). Fragments of late Archaic architectural terracottas found above in the western area of the plateau have been taken as evidence of one or more naiskoi (Adamesteanu and Dilthey ( 1978 ) 525 fig. 53 ; Adamesteanu ( 1980 b ) 88 -89 ). The major urban cult was that of Athena Ilias, presumably the patron divinity ( Mir. ausc . 106 ; Strabo 6 . 1 . 14 ). Other evidence of cult includes a C6l-C5e bronze plaque listing objects, in Achaian script, belonging to the sanctuary, epi Siri and epi dromo , of a female divinity which is with some uncertainty identified as Hera, Athena or Demeter (Guarducci ( 1958 ) 52 , 57 -58 : C6s; LSAG 287 : c. 475 ; Guarducci, EG i. 117 -18 ). Circumstantial evidence suggests a cult of Artemis Bendis (Hänsel ( 1973 ) 457 ). The Archaic cemeteries are found on the outermost western part of the plateau, with evidence of burials inside the circuit wall (Adamesteanu ( 1975 b ) 526 -27 , ( 1980 a )), but mainly in an extensive area to the west of the plateau (Contrade Cerchiarito, Schirone and Madonelle) (Adamesteanu ( 1974 ) 111 -16 ). Such separate well-defined cemeteries point to separate nuclei of settlement. The funerary road, later the continuation of the plataia of Herakleia, was originally an important artery of the territory, also leading to the chora of Dionysos known from C4 but possibly of more ancient origin (see the entry for Herakleia Leukania). An architectural fragment from Olympia has been taken as evidence of a treasury of Siris (Mertens-Horn and Viola ( 1990 ) 242 ). Siris may have minted coins.An issue of C6s incuse staters on the Achaian standard carry the Sybarite type of a bull looking back and double legends in the Achaian alphabet: obv . ΣΙΡΙΝΟΣ (retr.), rev . ΠΥΞΟΕΣ or ΠΥΞ (Gorini ( 1975 ) 9 , 95 -98 ; Sternberg ( 1980 ); Rutter, HN ³ 1722 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1387 ; SNG Cop. Suppl . 53 ). A single third-stater with obv . legend ΣΙΡΙ is attested (Sternberg ( 1980 ) 127 , 139 ; Moscati Castelnuovo ( 1989 ) 94 n. 7 ; Rutter, HN ³ 1727 ). The interpretation of these coins is uncertain. The legend ΣΙΡΙΝΟΣ is either a city-ethnic of Siris or a toponym (Sirinos; see Pyxous (no. 67 )). If it is the city-ethnic of Siris, the coinage may be a joint issue of Siris and Pyxous, though it is a problem that the two sites are situated far apart, or of Siris and some otherwise unknown locality near Siris (cf. Gallo ( 1996 ) 97 -100 ). The initial issue is normally dated c. 550 -540 (Moscati Castelnuovo ( 1989 ) 94 -100 ; Sternberg ( 1980 ) unconvincingly interprets the early Siris coinage as a prototype for Sybaris' coinage and dates it 560 -550 ). The Sybarite bull type dates the issue to after the destruction of Siris by Sybaris et al . ( supra ), and the coinage therefore represents a Siris within Sybaris' dominion, rather than an issue of an independent city (cf. Parise ( 1972 ) 102 -4 ; Guzzo ( 1989 ) 41 , 46 ). The coinage has been divided into four series (Libero Mangieri ( 1981 ) or into two series (Sternberg ( 1980 )) terminating c. 510 contemporary with the fall of Sybaris."
70,Sybaris (Sybaritas),Italia and Kampania,39.45,16.3,3969,20225,"70 . Sybaris (Sybaritas) Map 46 . Lat. 39 . 45 , long. 16 . 30 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A. The toponym is Συacuteβαρις , ηasper (Hdt. 5 . 44 . 1 ; Ar. Vesp . 1435 ). The city-ethnic is Συβαρίτας (ML 10 ( 550 -525 ); C5l coin, infra ), in the Ionic dialect Συβαρίτης (Hdt. 6 . 127 . 1 ). Sybaris I . Sybaris is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 5 . 45 . 1 and Theophr. Hist. pl . 1 . 9 . 5 , and in the political sense at Hdt. 6 . 21 . 1 and at Arist. Pol . 1303 a 26 , 29 , where Sybaris is the first of eight examples listed under the heading polis . The Aristotelian collection of politeiai seems to have included a Συβαριτῶν πολιτεία ( 132 , Gigon = fr. 583 , Rose). It is called an αποικία at Ps.-Skymnos 340 . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested on coins from C6l, once in nom. sing. ( infra ). The external collective use is found in ML 10 ( 550 -525 ); Hdt. 5 . 44 . 2 ; Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 12 ; and Arist. Pol . 1303 a 32 . The external individual use is found at Hdt. 5 . 47 . 1 (rC6s) and 6 . 127 . 1 (rC6f) and IG ii² 2326 . 4 = SEG 32 217 (C3 , r 616 ). Sybaris is implicitly described as patre ( = patris ) in Hdt. 6 . 127 . 1 -4 . Sybaris was founded in the last quarter of C8 ( 721 / 20 : Ps.Skymnos 360 ; or 709 / 8 : Euseb. Chron . 91 b Helm),a date confirmed by archaeological evidence (Guzzo ( 1982 a )). It was commonly regarded as an Achaian foundation (Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 12 ; Ps.-Skymnos 340 ), but Arist. Pol . 1303 a 29 describes it as a joint foundation of Troizenians (no. 367 ) and Achaians. Solin. 2 . 10 describes it as founded by Troizenians and Sagaris, the son of the Lokrian Aias; Ant. Lib. Met . 8 . 7 describes it as a Lokrian foundation, but this Lokrian tradition is presumably simple aetiology, entirely without historical value (Papathomopoulos ad Ant. Lib. 8 . 7 ). The oecist is reported to have been Is of Helike (Strabo 6 . 1 . 12 ; Pugliese Carratelli ( 1972 -73 ) 17 ; Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 204 ; Bugno ( 1999 )). Greek finds show that the chora of Sybaris extended as far as the valleys of the rivers Krathis and Sybaris (modern Coscile). Northwards the settlement of Amendolara ( = Lagaria according to de La Genière ( 1991 b )) delimits the Sybarite and Sirite areas of influence, southwards the border between Sybarite and Krotoniate areas of influence is unclear (Guzzo ( 1982 a )). There is archaeological evidence, as early as C8 , of Sybarite influence far inland along the routes offering shortcuts to the Tyrrhenian coast (survey in de La Genière ( 1978 ) 344 -54 ), and the defeat of Sybaris by Kroton (no. 56 ) in 510 is reflected in the abandonment of sites on the Tyrrhenian coast, e.g. at Petrosa di Scalea (cf. E. Greco ( 1990 ) 47 , 51 -52 ). An important Athena sanctuary (cf. CEG 394 ; C5s graffito: Arena ( 1996 ) no. 28 . 9 ) with C7 temples was located in the hinterland of Sybaris on the plateau of Timpone della Motta (Francavilla Marittima; de La Genière ( 1989 ); R. Russo ( 1996 ); Maaskant Kleibrink ( 2000 ); Ridgway ( 2002 ) 135 -36 ), the site of an earlier indigenous settlement identified by some as Lagaria (cf. Strabo 6 . 1 . 14 ). There is evidence of a rural sanctuary of Hera further inland en route for Laos, mentioned on the inscribed axe found at S. Sosti (Arena ( 1996 ) no. 36 . 15 ; cf. Steph. Byz. 589 . 14 with discussion by Lucca ( 1994 )). The heyday of Sybaris was the Archaic period down to 510 , the date of its crushing defeat at the hands of the Krotoniates.In the C6f war against Siris (no. 69 ), Sybaris was allied with Kroton (no. 56 ) and Metapontion (no. 61 ) (Just. Epit . 20 . 2 . 3 -4 ). By C6m at the latest Sybaris had come to control a vast dominion (comprising, according to the inflated report by Strabo 6 . 1 . 13 , four neighbouring ethne and twenty-five poleis hypekooi ; cf. Ampolo ( 1992 ) 246 with refs.); in extent, the dominion of Sybaris may have been as large as c. 3 , 000 km ² (Ampolo ( 1992 ) 247 ). At least one of the mechanisms employed by Sybaris to control its dependencies was a hegemonic symmachia : ML 10 ( 550 -525 ) shows the city as the leader of an alliance including the Serdaioi and other unspecified symmachoi . Apparently some of the cities and communities in the dominion of Sybaris issued coins, while others did not; this may perhaps be a reflection of differences in degree of dependency. Numismatic evidence suggests that Laos (no. 58 ), Temesa (no. 72 ) and the unidentified settlements or communities of Ami[-] and the So[-] were also subordinate to Sybaris (Parise ( 1984 ) 253 , ( 1988 ) 307 -9 ; cf. also Rutter ( 1997 ) 22 -27 and the list of preHeltic settlements supra ). According to Diod. 12 . 9 . 2 (rC6 ), Sybaris granted citizenship to many foreigners, and this may possibly be connected with the control of the dominion (Rutter ( 1970 ) 171 ). The city was also active as coloniser, founding Laos (no. 58 ) prior to 510 and Poseidonia (no. 66 ) c. 600 ; see also Skidros in the list of nonpolis sites supra . The large figures reported for the number of citizens ( 100 , 000 astoi : Ps.-Skymnos 341 ; 300 , 000 politai : Diod. 10 . 23 , 12 . 9 . 2 ) or armed forces ( 300 , 000 men: Diod. 10 . 23 and Strabo 6 . 1 . 13 ; 50 , 000 horse: Ath. 519 C = Timaeus ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 50 ), although obviously legendary, may all the same indicate a very populous city; the size of the urban area ( c. 500 ha, infra ) confirms that Sybaris was indeed a large city. The city was founded on a row of coastal dunes parallel to the coast between the rivers Krathis and Sybaris. It had a perimeter of 50 stades ( c. 9 -10 km) according to Strabo 6 . 1 . 13 , possibly implying a circuit wall though there is no archaeological evidence of such a wall. However, recent investigations indicate that the extent of the city was about 500 ha. Most of the urban remains lie under 4 m-deep alluvial deposits, not, however, unequivocally to be connected with Kroton's destruction of Sybaris (Strabo 6 . 1 . 13 ). However, the destruction of 510 is archaeologically attested and revealed bydestroyed and flooded strata (Guzzo ( 1976 ) 51 , ( 1997 ) 379 ). Only about 5 ha ( 1 per cent of the presumed urban area!) has been investigated by excavations. The earliest Greek material confirms a foundation in C8l (Guzzo ( 1982 a )) but the structural remains are later, and it is uncertain whether the first phase comprised one large settlement or a plurality of smaller nucleated settlements (Guzzo ( 1982 a ) 241 , 243 ). The C7 -C6 remains came to light in two zones, 'Parco di Cavallo' and 'Stombi' , c. 1 , 800 m apart, and revealed some consistent orientation though the overall urban layout of the city is uncertain (Carando ( 1999 )). An industrial quarter is evidenced by kilns (Various authors ( 1972 ), ( 1973 ), ( 1988 -89 )). Architectural fragments from 'Parco di Cavallo' testify to a major C6s temple (a Heraion?), and there is further evidence of a monumental rectangular C6 building, probably with a public purpose (Zancani Montuoro ( 1972 -73 a ); Various authors ( 1988 -89 ) 27 -28 ). There is little evidence for cults: Zeus and Apollo are listed as proxenoi ('guarantors') of the symmachia treaty ML 10 ( 550 -525 ). Dorieus, who had supported Kroton against Sybaris (Hdt. 5 . 44 -45 ), founded a sanctuary with a temple for Athena Krathia (Hdt. 5 . 45 ) after the defeat of Sybaris by Kroton,and votive material from 'Stombi'possibly refers to Athena (Zancani Montuoro ( 1972 -73 a ) 67 ); further evidence for Athena in CEG 394 ( 600 -550 ). A number of sources refer to the cult of Hera at Sybaris (Ael. VH 3 . 43 ; Ath. 518 C; cf. also T orelli ( 1988 ) 594 ), and c. C6m structural remains have been attributed to a Heraion ( supra ). Whether the later Thourian cults of Zeus, Athena, Aphrodite, Dionysos and Herakles (see entry for Thourioi) were in vogue in Sybaris is unknown (cf. Zancani Montuoro ( 1972 -73 a ) 57 ). A festival with large monetary prizes is hinted at by Ath. 522 D. Two citizens of Sybaris achieved Olympic victories: Philytas in 616 ( Olympionikai 71 (boys' boxing)) and Kleomrotos in C6f ( CEG 394 (event unknown)), and it seems that already by C6f Sybaris rewarded its victors handsomely (Mann ( 2001 ) 69 -70 , discussing CEG 394 ( 6 f)). The Sybarites seem to have had treasuries at Olympia (Paus. 6 . 19 . 9 ; Mertens-Horn and Viola ( 1990 ) 240 -46 ) and at Delphi (Strabo 9 . 3 . 8 ) with rich dedications (Ath. 605 A-B). For attempts to identify a C6m treasury of the Sybarites in the architectural remains at Delphi, see Partida ( 2000 ) 261 -63 . In C6m, the city published a public document at Olympia (ML 10 ). Communal consultation of the Delphic oracle is reported by Ael. VH 3 . 43 (rC6s). For the possible existence of a system of civic subdivisions, see Jones, POAG 164 -65 . Little is known of the constitution prior to 510 ; an early stasis is attested in Arist. Pol . 1303 a 25 -31 : it seems to have been rooted in ethnic differences and ended with the expulsion of the Troizenians by the Achaians. In general, the information relating to the king/tyrant Telys and his rise to power suggests that prior to his reign Sybaris was an oligarchy,and the importance of the aristocracy is attested by the participation of Smindyrides of Sybaris in the competition for the hand of the daughter of the tyrant Kleisthenes of Sikyon (Hdt. 6 . 127 ; Diod. 8 . 19 ). Telys is described as basileus at Hdt. 5 . 44 . 1 , as tyrannos at Hdt. 5 . 44 . 2 ; cf. Carlier ( 1984 ) 470 , and his rule as a tyrannis at Heraclid. Pont. fr. 49 , Wehrli. Diod. 12 . 9 . 2 describes him as having risen to power as a demagogos , e.g. by having persuaded the Sybarites to exile 500 of the euporotatoi citizens and confiscate their property. The exiles found refuge at Kroton (no. 56 ), and Telys sent an embassy demanding the extradition of the exiles on threat of war (Diod. 12 . 9 . 3 ). The Krotoniates opted for war, and in the ensuing battle in 510 they won a decisive victory (Diod. 12 . 9 . 5 -6 ), killed off the larger part of the Sybarite army and went on to sack the city (Hdt. 6 . 21 ; Diod. 12 . 10 . 1 ). Thus Sybarite power was eliminated and the phase of Sybarite history often referred to as 'Sybaris I'came to an end. Sybaris II . However, the defeat did not mean the annihilation of Sybaris. Some citizens escaped to the Sybarite colonies of Laos (no. 58 ) and Skidros (Hdt. 6 . 21 . 1 ), but other survivors must have remained, as appears from several pieces of evidence: ( 1 ) incuse coins inscribed with the abbreviated ethnics of both Kroton and Sybaris ( /KoppaΡΟ -ΣΥ ) indicate that Sybaris passed into dependency on Kroton (see § 2 a in the numismatic section infra and the entry for Kroton); and this is confirmed by ( 2 ), the report that the Krotoniates appointed a governor at Sybaris (Iambl. VP 74 ; Minar ( 1942 ) 74 ; Rutter ( 1970 ) 169 ); ( 3 ) when besieged by the Krotoniates in 467 , the Sybarites called on Hieron of Syracuse for help (Diod. 11 . 48 . 4 ). This implies a (fortified) settlement at the site of Sybaris (Rutter ( 1970 ) 174 ), the ability to conduct foreign policy, and an (unsuccessful) attempt to obtain some independence from Krotoniate hegemony.There is,thus,no doubt that a polis of Sybaris continued to exist, but it was now a dependent polis of Kroton (cf. Kahrstedt ( 1918 ) 181 -82 ). To this 'Sybaris II' have been attributed the coins described in § 2 b of the numismatic section infra . The size or status of Sybarite territory in this period is unknown. The earlier dominion of Sybaris was dissolved, and cities like Temesa (no. 72 ) and Laos (no. 58 ) were now probably dependencies of Kroton (no. 56 ) as revealed by the second issue of Sybaris, Kroton and Laos mentioned in § 2 a of the numismatic section infra . Iambl. VP 255 (rC6l) seems to indicate that at least some Sybarite land was appropriated by Kroton (Rutter ( 1970 ) 169 ). Dorieus founded a sanctuary of Athena Krathia after the defeat of Sybaris by Kroton (Hdt. 5 . 45 ) and the cult probably continued during C5 . The importance of the Athena sanctuary on the plateau of Timpone della Motta (Francavilla Marittima) remained undiminished during the C5 (de La Genière ( 1989 ) 494 -95 ). For 'Sybaris II' , as well as for the following phases of the city, the archaeological evidence is limited. The destruction of 'Sybaris I' is documented ( supra ), but there is continuity of life throughout C5 , although the finds from and structures attributable to C5e are few. Attribution of single strata or structural remains to the different phases outlined above and below is not possible as the finds most often have a longer lifespan than that allowed for the individual phases of Sybarite history (Guzzo ( 1976 ) 51 -52 ). Sybaris III . According to Diod. 11 . 90 . 3 -4 and 12 . 10 . 2 , fiftyeight years after the 510 catastrophe (i.e. in 453 ) a Thessalian or a man named Thessalos ( 11 . 90 . 3 ) or, more unlikely, Thessalians, refounded ( 12 . 10 . 3 ) the city ( εξ αρχηtildeς Ωsubiotaώκισε τηgraveν Συacuteβαριν : 11 . 90 . 3 ; συνΩsubiotaώκισαν : 12 . 10 . 2 ). However, after a while (five years?) the Sybarites were driven out by the Krotoniates ( 12 . 10 . 2 , cf. 11 . 90 . 4 ), and sent presbeis to Sparta (no. 345 ) and Athens (no. 361 ) requesting assistance and reinforcements in their attempt to return (Diod. 12 . 10 . 3 -4 ). This phase,'Sybaris III' , from c. 453 to the initial stages of the foundation of Thourioi (no. 74 ), is probably reflected in a new series of double-relief coins (cf. § 3 in the numismatic section infra ). Sybaris IV . During the first phase of the process which eventually led to the foundation of Thourioi in 446 / 5 , Sybaris was reinforced by Athenians and Peloponnesians (Diod. 12 . 10 . 4 ) and seems indeed still to have been called, and located at, Sybaris (coins; cf. RE iv ² . 1008 ; Rutter ( 1973 ) 163 ). The community was strongly dominated by Sybarites, and a period of serious stasis was caused by the claims of the original Sybarites to privileges in the political, cultic and economic spheres of life; the Sybarites, however, were put to death almost to the last man or expelled,thus paving the way for the foundation of Thourioi proper (Diod. 12 . 11 . 1 -4 ; cf. Arist. Pol . 1303 a 31 -33 and Strabo 6 . 1 . 13 ). To this initial 'Sybarite' phase of Thourioi = 'Sybaris IV' have been attributed the coins described in § 4 of the numismatic section infra . V. Sybaris on the Traeis . The Sybarites expelled from Thourioi (no. 74 ) in 446 / 5 (cf.'Sybaris IV' , supra ), settled by the river Traeis according to Diod. 12 . 22 . 1 (this settlement remains unlocated). According to Strabo 6 . 1 . 14 , one tradition ( τινές ) said that Sybaris on the Teuthras (emended to Traeis by Meineke) was founded by Rhodians.This tradition may reflect a Rhodian settlement, otherwise unknown, in the region where the Sybarites later settled, or, more likely, the tradition is mistaken (Walbank ( 2000 ) 24 ). T o Sybaris on the Traeis are ascribed the coins described in § 5 of the numismatic section infra . According to Polyb. 2 . 39 . 6 , Sybaris combined with Kroton (no. 56 ) and Kaulonia (no. 55 ) to form an Achaian confederation in imitation of the homeland Achaians. The date of this confederation, and thus of the Sybaris participating in it, is uncertain, but the date is probably C5s, and the reference would then be to Sybaris on the Traeis (Walbank, HCP ad loc . and ( 2000 ) 24 ; Mele ( 1983 a ) 86 n. 546 ; Giangiulio ( 1989 ) 177 n. 52 , 197 ). If the alliance dates to 430 -420 , this is the best evidence for polis status of Sybaris on the Traeis, apart from its coins. In any case, the city was soon (after χρόνον τινά : Diod. 12 . 22 . 1 ) destroyed by the Brettians and thus Sybaris came to a final end (ibid . ). Sybaris seems to have struck coins in all its different phases and manifestations. § 1 . Coins of Sybaris I . Coins on the Achaian standard were struck from c. 540 , possibly as the earliest of the Achaian incuse coinages of South Italy. At first only staters were minted, but gradually lower denominations with the same type were also struck (drachms, triobols and obols). The type shows a bull facing left with head turned back, normally interpreted as a river divinity. Legends: ΣΥ , ΣΥΒ , ΣΥΒΑ , ΣΥΒΑΡΙΤΑΣ (Guarducci, EG i. 112 , ii. 618 ; Gorini ( 1975 ) 10 -11 ; Rutter, HN ³ 1729 -39 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1388 -93 ). Sybaris I struck coins in some quantity, coins which circulated from the Ionian to the Tyrrhenian coast. Alongside this coinage are found other series in the same incuse fabric, on the Achaian standard and with the same type (bull looking back), but with legends referring to cities other than Sybaris itself: Siris (no. 69 ) or Sirinos/Pyxous (no. 67 ), and two unknown sites named Ami- and So(Euboic standard). An issue of incuse staters and drachms on the Achaian standard,though with the type of a boar and the retrograde legends ΠΑΛ ( obv .) and ΜΟΛ ( rev .), thought to have been made at some settlement of Palinouros and/or Molpa, has also been placed within the Sybarite sphere of influence (Parise ( 1972 ) esp. 102 -11 ; Gorini ( 1975 ) 9 , 12 -13 ). These issues are interpreted as having been struck under a C6s hegemony or dominion of Sybaris, rather than as an alliance coinage (see the entries for these sites in Inventory and in list of nonpolis sites supra ). § 2 . Coins of Sybaris II . (a) Incuse coins (staters and triobols) with obv . Krotoniate tripod, legend: /KoppaΡΟ ; rev . Sybarite bull, legend: ΣΥ , as well as staters and triobols with obv . Krotoniate tripod with ΣΥ r. and octopus l.; rev . Sybarite bull, legend: ΛΑΙ (for Laos (no. 58 )) in exergue (Gorini ( 1975 ) 26 . 1 ; Rutter, HN ³ p. 145 ) can be ascribed to an early phase of Sybaris II (C6l) when the city was subordinate to Kroton (no. 56 ). (b) To this Sybaris may also belong incuse staters similar to, but stylistically more advanced than, those of § 1 , as well as triobols with obv . standing bull, legend: ΣΥ ; rev . amphora incuse; and obols with obv . bull; rev . acorn incuse (Kraay ( 1958 ) 15 -16 ; Gorini ( 1975 ) 12 . 10 -11 , dated to 530 -510 ; Rutter, HN ³ 1740 -43 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1394 -95 (triobols)). § 3 . Coins of Sybaris III . This phase,'Sybaris III' , from c. 453 to the foundation of Thourioi (no. 74 ), is probably reflected in a new series of double-relief coins issued under Poseidonian influence. Staters: obv . striding Poseidon; rev . bull facing right, legend: ΣΥΒ (Rutter, HN ³ 1743 ). Triobols and obols: obv . striding Poseidon; rev . bird (Rutter, HN ³ 1744 -45 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1397 ). In this period Sybaris also issued coins jointly with Poseidonia (no. 66 ) and Laos (no. 58 ). Poseidonia and Sybaris III: triobols with obv . Poseidon, legend: ΣΥ ; rev . bull facing right, legend: ΠΟΣ (Rutter, HN ³ 1746 -49 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1399 -1401 ). Laos and Sybaris III: diobols with obv . bull, legend: ethnic of Laos; rev . two circles (as on diobols of Laos proper), legend: ΣΥΒΑ or Σ and Λ , for Laos (Rutter, HN ³ 2284 ). Some triobols of Laos: obv . bull; rev . acorn (cf. § 2 b), legend: ΣΥ on the obv . (Rutter, HN ³ 2282 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1398 ). § 4 . Coins of Sybaris IV . To the initial phase of the Sybarite-Athenian settlement of Thourioi = Sybaris IV have been ascribed two issues with the ethnic ΣΥΒΑΡΙ and ΣΥΒΑ in the Ionic alphabet, and types obv . helmeted head of Athena (a reference to the Athenian involvement in the foundation?); rev . (first series) bull looking back in the style of Sybaris I (Rutter, HN ³ 1750 ; SNG Cop. Italy 1402 -4 ); rev . (second series) bull with lowered head butting, in the exergue a fish-a symbol not found on earlier Sybarite coinage (Rutter, HN ³ 1753 ; Rutter ( 1989 ) 251 ; Bugno ( 1997 )). § 5 . Coins of Sybaris on the Traeis . A late coinage in the incuse technique: staters with the bull type and the obv . legends: in exergue ΣΥ retrograde and in field ΒΑΡ (Kraay ( 1958 ) 29 -32 ; Gorini ( 1975 ) 12 . 12 , 105 ), is assigned to Sybaris on the Traeis, as is a triobol of c. 400 : obv . horseman; rev . standing bull, legend: ΣΥΒΑΡΙΤΟΝ (Rutter, HN ³ 1754 -56 )."
71,Taras (Tarantinos),Italia and Kampania,40.3,17.15,4009,20355,"71 . Taras (Tarantinos) Map 45 . Lat. 40 . 30 , long. 17 . 15 . Size of territory: 4 (C5 ). Type: A. The toponym is Τάρας (C6l-C4 coins, infra ; Hdt. 1 . 24 . 1 ; IG IV ² . 1 95 . 43 ( 356 / 5 )), οasper (Thuc. 6 . 104 . 2 ) or ηasper (Strabo 6 . 3 . 3 ). The city-ethnic is Ταραντῖνος (C5l-C4 coins, infra ; Hdt. 7 . 130 . 3 ; Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 11 ). Taras is called a polis in the urban sense by Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 13 , and implicitly at Ps.-Skylax 14 where Taras is the third toponym listed after the heading πόλεις εισιgraveν αιasperacuteδε ; in the political sense it is called a polis in Thuc. 6 . 44 . 2 ; Pl. Leg . 637 B; Theopomp. fr. 233 ; and SGDI 1567 / 4620 (C4l-C3e). A Ταραντίνων πολιτεία (Heracl. Lemb. 57 ; Arist. fr. 607 , Gigon) was included among the 158 Aristotelian politeiai ; politeuesthai is found at Pol . 1320 b 14 . Demos (ho Tarantinon) is found in Arist. Pol . 1320 b 13 and Theopomp. fr. 100 , and demosios in Theopomp. fr. 233 . It is called πάτρη ( = patris ) in AG 7 . 715 . 1 and patris in CEG ii 833 (C5l-C4e). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested on C5l coins ( infra ); the external collective use is found in Lazzarini ( 1976 ) nos. 971 -72 ( 500 -475 ); IvO 254 -56 ( c. 440 ); Hdt. 3 . 136 . 2 ; Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 12 ; and Theopomp. fr. 233 . The external individual use is found in IG xii . 9 187 A ( = ML 82 ( c. 411 )) and IG xii . 9 187 B (C4e). Taras was a colony of Sparta (no. 345 ; Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 13 ; Ephor. fr. 216 ; Pl. Leg . 637 B; Arist. Pol . 1306 b 31 ; cf. Cartledge ( 1979 ) 123 -24 and Malkin ( 1994 ) 128 with n. 68 ) founded in C8l ( 706 according to Euseb. Chron . 91 , Helm; cf. Van Compernolle ( 1992 ) 774 ). By the late Archaic (Nafissi ( 1999 ) 246 , 255 ) and Classical periods there existed a full legendary account of the foundation ( locc. citt .): Taras was founded by the so-called Partheniai ( locc. citt .), a group of Spartan citizens ( εκ τῶν οasper µ οίων , Arist.) who had become atimoi (Antiochos) and attempted revolution (Arist.). The oikistes was Phalanthos (Antiochos).The city owed its name to the hero Taras, eponym also of the river Taras (Antiochos); see Lo Porto ( 1964 ) 178 -84 ; Moscati Castelnuovo ( 1991 ); Malkin ( 1994 ) 115 -42 ; Nafissi ( 1999 ) 251 -58 . The foundation of Taras is connected with that of Satyrion, mentioned in the oracle to Phalanthos (Diod. 8 . 21 . 3 ) and probably earlier than Taras. Satyrion is identified with settlement remains at Saturo on the coast c. 12 km to the south-east of Taras, where Lakonians occupied the Iapygian site a few years before settling at Taras (Lo Porto ( 1964 )). Satyrion probably continued as a trading station serving Taras. The name of the territory was ηasper Ταραντίνη (Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 3 apud Strabo 6 . 1 . 4 ); it bordered on the territory of Brentesion (no. 78 ) (Strabo 6 . 3 . 6 ). It was soon occupied by sanctuaries, which seem to have delimited the chora , and by several small Greek(?) settlements, at times fortified, and cemeteries situated in the hills surrounding the plain of Taras (Corchiaro ( 1981 ); E. Greco ( 1995 b ) 87 ); however, none of these settlements is with certainty identified as Tarantine (Lamboley ( 1996 ) 6 ), and in any case they were soon eclipsed by Taras itself (E. Greco ( 1981 b ); Nenci ( 1987 ) 198 (Cavallino)). From C7 to C4m the chora gradually expanded towards the north-east and south-east, and grew from c. 350 km ² to c. 1 , 000 km ² (Alessio and Guzzo ( 1989 -90 ); Osanna ( 1992 ) 11 -16 ). Early warfare against Metapontion (no. 61 ) for control or expansion of the territory seems implied by Strabo 6 . 1 . 15 . In the Classical period Taras fought several wars against both Greek and non-Greek communities, presumably for territorial control: in 473 , the city was severely defeated by the Iapygians (Diod. 11 . 52 . 3 -4 ; cf. Hdt. 7 . 170 . 3 -4 ); C5f victories over the Messapioi and the Peuketioi were commemorated at Delphi (Lazzarini ( 1976 ) no. 971 ; cf. Paus. 10 . 10 . 6 : Messapioi; Lazzarini ( 1976 ) no. 972 ; cf. Paus. 10 . 13 . 10 : Peuketioi). Dedications of spoils taken from Thourioi (no. 74 ) were made at Olympia c. 440 ( IvO 254 -56 = ML 57 ); Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 11 explicitly states that the latter war was fought for control of the Siritis. The war was ended by an agreement to found a joint colony which developed into Herakleia (no. 52 ) (ibid. = Staatsverträge 158 ). In C4 , the city under Archytas had close ties with Dionysios II of Syracuse, securing Syracusan influence in the Adriatic (Pl. Ep . 7 . 339 D; Dem. 61 . 46 ; Brauer ( 1986 ) 43 -59 ). Also in C4 , Taras fought the Messapioi (Iambl. VP 197 ), and the Leukanians (Diod. 16 . 61 . 4 (r 356 ); cf. Diod. 16 . 62 . 4 , 88 . 3 ). Such wars induced the city to seek help from Sparta (no. 345 ) in 340 (Sparta sent Archidamos: Theopomp. fr. 232 ; Diod. 16 . 62 . 4 , 63 . 1 ) and from Alexander I of Epeiros in 334 -330 (Strabo 6 . 3 . 4 ; Just. Epit . 12 . 2 . 1 , 23 . 1 . 15 ). Conflicts with the local population may have been a feature of Tarantine life right from the beginning, for the city itself presumably took over the site of a pre-existing non-Greek community (Lo Porto ( 1970 ) 356 ). During the period of democratic rule in C4 Taras was very powerful, and its military forces comprised the largest fleet of Magna Graecia (naval forces are attested already by Thuc. 8 . 91 . 2 ). Allegedly, Taras could muster 30 , 000 infantry, 3 , 000 cavalry and 1 , 000 hipparchoi (Strabo 6 . 3 . 4 ) in the age of Archytas.Diodorus has 20 , 000 infantry and 2 , 000 cavalry ( 20 . 104 . 2 (r 303 )) as the citizen troops mobilised by Kleonymos in 303 . And Taras was known as the most populous of the cities of Magna Graecia (Ps.-Skymnos 330 ). If the army figures are of the right order of magnitude, Taras, at its peak in C4 , must have had a citizen population of over 100 , 000 plus an unknown number of foreigners and slaves (on the basis of these army figures, Wuilleumier ( 1939 ) 173 -74 calculates a C4m citizen population of 240 , 000 and a C4l one of 155 , 000 ; Beloch ( 1886 ) 302 suggests 60 , 000 for C3l). The large extent of the C5 -C4 city, c. 530 ha, may support a high population figure, though the intramural area included the cemetery (Polyb. 8 . 28 . 7 ). In C5l-C4e, Taras was presumably a member of the Italiote League ( Staatsverträge 230 ). A treaty of symmachia with Rhegion (no. 68 ) is attested for 473 by Diod. 11 . 52 . 3 (cf. Hdt. 7 . 170 . 3 ). Some kind of treaty ( συ µ βηtildeναι ) between Taras and Thourioi (no. 74 ) concerning a joint colony is implied by Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 12 = Staatsverträge 158 , and Taras seems to have been the senior partner in this collaboration ( τηgraveν αποικίαν κριθηtildeναι Ταραντίνων ). Thuc. 8 . 91 . 2 refers to Tarantine naval forces supporting Sparta against Athens, thus implying a treaty with Sparta. The arrangement with Sparta which led to the expedition of Archidamos in 344 is described as a symmachia by Theopomp.fr. 232 and Diod. 16 . 62 . 4 , 63 . 1 . A board of strategoi is attested down to C3e (Zonar. 8 . 2 ); their number is unknown (Urso ( 1998 ) 1 -10 ). Diog. Laert. 8 . 79 (rC4m) refers to a law stipulating that the office of strategos could not be held in two consecutive years. However, Archytas exceptionally served continuously (from 367 or from 356 ) for six (Ael. VH 7 . 14 ) or seven years (Aristox.fr. 48 , Wehrli; cf. Strabo 6 . 3 . 4 ; only Suda , s.v. Αρχυacuteτας , describes him as στρατηγοgraveς αυτοκράτωρ , but it is uncertain whether this refers to an office of the Italiote League or an extraordinay office of the city as attested for C3e (Zonar. 8 . 2 : 281 )). Plut. Quaest. Graec . 42 ( = Theophr. fr. 133 , Wimmer) describes a meeting of the assembly at which a strategos refused to recognise the outcome of a vote taken by show of hands,but it is unclear whether he was relying on the constitutional powers of the office to do so. Strategoi were appointed by election (Ael. VH 7 . 14 ). Anexile is mentioned at Hdt. 3 . 138 . 1 . Reception of envoys in C4m is attested in Aristox. fr. 50 , Wehrli, and implied by Hdt. 3 . 138 . 2 (rC6l); sending of envoys is attested in Theopomp. fr. 232 and Diod. 16 . 62 . 4 (r 346 / 5 ). Citizens of Taras were appointed proxenoi by Eretria (no. 370 ) c. 411 ( IG xii . 9 187 A = ML 82 ) and C4e ( IG xii . 9 187 B), by Athens (no. 361 ) in C4m ( IG ii² 248 ), and by Delphi (no. 177 ) in C4l ( F.Delphes iii . 1 135 ). Two citizens served as theorodokoi of Epidauros (no. 348 ) in 356 / 5 ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 44 ). A C4l-C3e inscription may suggest the existence of some system of civic subdivisions (Jones, POAG 161 ). At 3 . 126 . 2 Herodotos refers to a τῶν Ταραντίνων βασιλευacuteς ; if by basileus Herodotos means tyrannos (the two terms are sometimes interchangeable, cf. 5 . 44 . 1 and 44 . 2 ; Luraghi ( 1994 ) 76 -77 ), Taras may have experienced a tyranny in C6l. However, since Taras was a Spartan colony, the existence of some kind of formal monarchy is not impossible (Malkin ( 1994 ) 132 with n. 87 ; add: Phot. s.v. ρasperηtildeτρα ; Nafissi ( 1999 ) 251 ). Democracy was introduced shortly after the Persian Wars (Arist. Pol . 1303 a 5 ); prior to that the constitution was a politeia , presumably favouring the gnorimoi , since Aristotle reports that the change of constitution was occasioned by heavy losses among the gnorimoi in a war against the Iapygians.At Pol . 1291 b 23 , too,Aristotle presumably classifies Taras as a democracy, and at Pol . 1320 b 11 -14 Taras is again classified as a democracy combining democratic sortition and oligarchic election in the selection of magistrates: all archai were dittai , and on each board some positions were filled by lot and others by election; or, alternatively, some magistracies were filled by election, others by sortition. Strabo 6 . 3 . 4 refers to C4 Taras as a democracy. No stasis proper is on record (Berger ( 1992 ) 53 ), but the foundation legend included a stasis immediately after the foundation (Just. Epit . 3 . 4 . 11 ) in which, among others, the oecist was exiled (Malkin ( 1994 ) 129 -30 ). Arist. Pol . 1320 b 11 ff refers to a plurality of boards of magistrates. The existence of ephoroi at the metropolis Sparta as well as the C5s Tarantine colony Herakleia ( IG xiv 645 . i . 1 (C4l); SEG 30 1162 -70 (C4l-C3e)) may suggest the existence of this office at Archaic and Classical Taras as well, but it is attested only from C3e ( SEG 40 901 ), when the office was eponymous. The ρasperητροφυacuteλακες ( Etym. Magn . s.v. ρasperήτρα ) were probably charged with the custody of the laws. The interpretation of the numerous monograms found on C4 coins is disputed: they may be names of ephoroi (Brunetti ( 1960 ) 48 -50 ), monetary magistrates or artists, or of chief civic magistrates (Rutter, HN ³ pp. 95 -96 ). A prytanis and an επιστατ [-] are attested by C4 -C2epigraphic evidence (Viola ( 1894 ) 61 . 3 ). The assembly was named αasperλίαια (i.e. αasperλία : Hesychius s.v.). The almost triangular Tarentine peninsula terminates in the isthmus, the akropolis according to Strabo 6 . 3 . 1 . The lagoon, Mare Piccolo, with the inner harbour was reached bythe natural waterway to the west of the isthmus,the stoma tou limenos of Strabo 6 . 3 . 1 (the artificial canal between the acropolis-isthmus and the eastern hinterland was cut in C15 ad , and the modern island status of the isthmus is not ancient). The acropolis, a low plateau measuring c. 16 ha (Lo Porto ( 1970 ) 362 ) surrounded by steep slopes,may have been strengthened with an ashlar circuit wall in C6 (ibid. 359 ; Strabo 6 . 3 . 1 seems to imply that the whole city, including the acropolis, was fortified). The isthmus was the site of the earliest Greek settlement and the early sanctuaries; the archaeological evidence confirms the traditional C8l date for the foundation (Lo Porto ( 1970 ) 357 -58 ; De Juliis ( 1983 ) 429 ; Boschung ( 1994 ) 177 ). No structural remains of the early habitation phases are extant, but the evidence from Ortygia (Syracuse) suggests a C6 origin for the east-west plateia with orthogonally joined stenopoi in accordance with a per strigas urban system (Lo Porto ( 1970 ) 361 -62 ). The early settlement had extended as far as the nearest part of the adjoining eastern plateau at least by C5 , and Strabo 6 . 3 . 1 locates the agora immediately to the east below the acropolis in the narrow space delimited to the west by the Archaic cemetery. From C5s the urban area measured c. 530 ha (E. Greco ( 1981 b ) 150 -51 ); a c. 10 km-long circuit wall built in 450 -430 incorporated the new urban extension and the Archaic cemeteries, with two long straight walls constructed as a double ashlar wall, joining the Mare Piccolo and the Mare Grande (Lo Porto ( 1970 ) 362 -64 ). Sporadic evidence makes it possible to reconstruct a Hippodamian urban plan, probably contemporary with that of Thourioi ( 444 / 3 ; E. Greco ( 1981 b ) 157 ); new cemeteries and public spaces were laid out inside the C5 circuit (for the Archaic and later cemeteries: Moreschini ( 1988 ); Lippolis ( 1994 b )). The eastern and western ends of the acropolis were laid out as sanctuaries from the early history of the colony: the east was the location of the C6e 'Temple of Poseidon' , the earliest known monumental stone temple in Magna Graecia (Filippi ( 1976 )). The divinity to whom the temple was dedicated is, however, uncertain: Stazio ( 1967 ) 306 -7 suggests Persephone,but Lippolis ( 1982 ) 90 Hera.To the west an ash- lar foundation has been taken to be part of the stereobate of a temple of monumental size (Lo Porto ( 1970 ) 376 ; but see Lippolis ( 1982 ) 84 -86 ). Sanctuaries were laid out outside the acropolis on the eastern plateau, along the Mare Piccolo where there is some evidence of C6 cult (Lippolis ( 1982 ) 117 ff). The whole coastal zone seems to have been laid out as a vast sanctuary with several heroa between the harbour and the cemeteries which have produced C6evidence of funeral and foundation cults (Jacobone ( 1988 )). The inner harbour, the Mare Piccolo, was famous in antiquity (Strabo 6 . 3 . 1 ; Polyb. 10 . 1 ); it was the only natural harbour in the Gulf of Taranto and the basis for Taras'economy and wealth. Ashlar walls of uncertain date are interpreted as piers (Lippolis ( 1982 ) 98 ). A harbour ( limen ) called Hydrous is mentioned by Ps.-Skylax 14 . Fishermen were, according to Arist. Pol . 1291 b 23 , very numerous at Taras. Significant socio-economic differentiations are implied by Arist. Pol . 1320 b 10 , where it is reported that the aporoi were allowed the use of private property in order to win their favour for the constitution. There is only sparse evidence of public buildings: a stepped structure near the agora has been interpreted as a bouleuterion or as a theatre (Todisco ( 1990 ) 149 ). A theatre near the agora was used for a C3l reception of Roman ambassadors (Dion. Hal. 19 . 5 . 8 ; Polyb. 8 . 30 . 7 (r 213 ); cf. Todisco ( 1990 ) 146 -49 ). A prytaneion is attested c. 360 (Ath. 700 D; Miller ( 1978 ) no. 434 ). A cult of, among others, the Atreidai is attested at Arist. Mir. ausc . 840 a 6 -7 (Malkin ( 1994 ) 57 -60 ; for a survey of Tarantine cults: Pugliese Carratelli ( 1970 a ); Hinz ( 1998 ) 182 -87 ). A tomb of (Apollo) Hyakinthos is mentioned at Polyb. 8 . 28 . 2 , and Hyakinthos may be depicted on coins ( infra ). A cult of Dionysos may be inferred from C5e numismatic evidence ( infra ); cf. Pl. Leg . 637 B. A cult of the Dioskouroi may be inferred from numismatic evidence ( infra ; Wuilleumier ( 1939 ) 519 -22 ). A cult of Zeus Eleutherios is referred to in Hesych. s.v. ' Ελευθέριος Ζευacuteς . Anth. Pal . 6 . 129 (Leonidas of Taras) concerns a dedication to Athena Koryphasia(?), of spoils taken from the Leukanians. However, the occasion is uncertain (C3e?), and it is not certain that Athena Koryphasia was worshipped in Taras (Gow-Page, HE 2 ( xxxiv ) 344 -45 ). The evidence for other cults is uncertain: Aphrodite Basilis (Osanna ( 1990 )); Persephone (extra-urban sanctuary: Wuilleumier ( 1939 ) 396 ); Apollo Alaios (C4 inscription on marble louterion : Buononato ( 1960 )); hero cults of Phalanthos and Taras (Lacroix ( 1965 ) 89 -100 ; Leschhorn ( 1984 ) 31 -41 ). Public sacrifices accompanied by demosiai hestiaseis are mentioned by Theopomp. fr. 233 . A festival of Dionysos is attested by Pl. Leg . 637 B. Communal consultation of the oracle at Dodona is attested in SGDI 1567 / 4620 (C4l-C3e). Syll . ³ 295 (C4 ) attests a grant of promanteia by Delphi (no. 177 ) to the Tarantines (Roux ( 1990 )). From 520 to 336 , Tarantine athletes won several Olympic victories ( Olympionikai 130 -31 , 212 , 230 , 238 , 307 , 397 , 436 , 457 ). In 500 -475 , a monument commemorating a victory over the Messapioi was dedicated at Delphi (Lazzarini ( 1976 ) no. 971 ; cf. Paus. 10 . 10 . 6 ; Beschi ( 1982 ) 232 ), and in the same period one commemorating a victory over the Peuketioi was dedicated, also at Delphi (Lazzarini ( 1976 ) no. 972 ; cf. Paus. 10 . 13 . 10 ; Beschi ( 1982 ) 236 ). Dedications of spoils taken from Thourioi (no. 74 ) were made at Olympia c. 440 ( IvO 254 -56 = ML 57 ). At Delphi architectural terracottas have be taken as evidence of a Tarantine treasury (Le Roy ( 1967 ) 70 -87 ). Taras initiated silver coinage about 520 -510 (Cahn ( 1968 )) or slightly later (Westermark ( 1979 ) 291 ; Rutter, HN ³ p. 92 ) in the incuse technique on the Achaean standard with nomoi divided into thirds as at Metapontion (for surveys of Tarantine coinage with refs., see Stazio ( 1970 ); FischerBossert ( 1999 ); Rutter, HN ³ pp. 92 -93 ). The earliest obv . type shows a kneeling youth holding lyre and flower, presumably Hyakinthos or Eros; legend: ΤΑΡΑΣ (Rutter, HN ³ 824 ; SNG Cop. Italy 766 ). The subsequent main obv . type of the nomoi depicts a dolphin rider (Taras or Phalanthos); legend: ΤΑΡΑΣ (Rutter, HN ³ 826 ; SNG Cop. Italy 765 ). Doublerelief coins were minted from C5e: obv . dolphin rider; rev . various types (e.g. hippocamp, four-spoked wheel, or female head); legends: ΤΑΡΑΣ , ΤΑΡ (Westermark ( 1979 ); Rutter, HN ³ 827 , 833 , 838 ; SNG Cop. Italy 767 -78 ). These were accompanied by fractions of the nomos : third-, sixth-, tenth- ( = litra), twentieth- ( = hemilitra), and sixthlitra with a variety of obv . and rev . types (dolphin, shell, wheel or hippocamp: Rutter, HN ³ 828 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 783 -86 ).A unique stater in Naples has rev . seated male figure holding a kantharos and distaff, probably the hero Taras, normally referred to as the 'oecist'type but here revealing a connection with the cult of Dionysos (Cahn ( 1968 ) 71 -72 ; Rutter, HN ³ 843 ), legend: ΤΑΡΑΣ ; rev . dolphin rider, legend: ΤΑΡΑΣ . From C5m the types of the nomoi are obv . dolphin rider, legend: ΤΑΡΑΣ / ΤΑΡΑΝΤΙΝΩΝ ; rev . seated male figure, the 'oecist' (Rutter, HN ³ 844 ; SNG Cop. Italy 779 -82 ); halfnomoi (drachms) have obv . hippocamp; rev . female head (Rutter, HN ³ 839 ; SNG Cop. Italy 787 -88 ). From C5s a horseman becomes the normal obv . type; rev . dolphin rider, legend: ΤΑΡΑΝΤΙΝΩΝ . These are the main types throughout C4 with some variants (Rutter, HN ³ 847 ff, 868 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 797 -829 ); obv . types have two riders, the Dioskouroi (Rutter, HN ³ 898 ; SNG Cop. Italy 830 ); new fractions appeared in C4 (Rutter, HN ³ 907 ff). In C4s the city struck in gold on the Attic standard on more than one occasion, usually with obv . type: head of Hera; rev . young Taras appealing to seated Poseidon (stater), dolphin rider (half-stater), infant Taras with wool and distaff (sixthstater), kantharos (twelfth-stater; Rutter, HN ³ 901 -4 ); time of Alexander the Molossian: stater with usual obv ., rev . horseman,in field sometimes thunderbolt; twentieth-stater with obv . Helios; rev . thunderbolt (Rutter, HN ³ 905 -6 ; SNG Cop. Italy 831 -34 ). Bronze coins were minted only in C3 (Rutter, HN ³ p. 106 ). Taras was the founder of Herakleia (no. 52 ), which was originally a joint colony of Taras and Thourioi (no. 74 ) (Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 12 ). The foundation of Herakleia involved the displacement of the previous inhabitants of Siris (no. 69 ; Diod. 12 . 36 . 4 (r 433 ))."
72,Temesa (Temesaios),Italia and Kampania,39.05,16.1,1011,5235,"72 . Temesa (Temesaios) Map 46 . Lat. 39 . 05 , long. 16 . 10 . Size of territory: ?. Type: B: β . The toponym is Τε µ έσεια , ηasper (Polyb. 13 . 10 . 3 ); Τε µ έση , ηasper (Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 ; Steph. Byz. 615 . 1 ); Τε µ έσ ( σ ) α , ηasper (Lycoph. Alex . 1067 ; Paus. 6 . 6 . 7 ); attractive, but still uncertain, is the identification with Homeric Τε µ έση (Hom. Od . 1 . 184 ; Biraschi ( 1982 )). Steph. Byz. 615 . 2 gives the city-ethnic as Τε µ εσαῖος and this form is found in Callim. Aet . fr. 85 . 10 , Pfeiffer, and may be abbreviated as ΤΕ and ΤΕΜ on C6 -C5 coins ( infra ) unless the legends abbreviate the toponym. For the location of Temesa, still not resolved, at Casalina di S. Sosti or further southwards at Fiumefreddo Bruzio, see Massaro ( 1982 ) 22 with refs. Recently sporadic archaeological evidence has been investigated on the fertile plain of Campora S. Giovanni near the coast in the Savuto valley, but the evidence is inconclusive, though the cultural assemblage is indeed C6s-C5f Greek (De Sensi Sestito and Valentini ( 1990 ) esp. 137 -42 ). Spadea (followed by Barr .) argues for a location at the Piano della Tirena, where the urban remains include parts of a circuit wall and habitation. However, these are mainly C4 and therefore belong primarily to the Oskan-BrettianHeltic period (Spadea ( 1990 a )), leaving the location of the Archaic city still unresolved (E. Greco ( 1986 ) 129 -30 , with reference also to the analogous case of Laos). Temesa is called polis only by late sources (Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 ; Steph. Byz. 615 . 1 ; Paus. 6 . 6 . 11 ); however, its C6 -C5 coinage ( infra ) suggests that it was a polis in the Archaic and Classical periods,albeit probably mostly a dependency of larger poleis ( infra ). According to Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 , T emesa was a foundation of the Ausonians, and the settlement accordingly was originally not Greek but indigenous. A later Greek or Heling phase is, however, suggested by the tradition of heroic colonisation by Aitolians led by Thoas, who in their turn were later ousted by Brettians (Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 ). This tradition may be connected with the activities of Alexander the Molossian in South Italy (Biraschi ( 1982 ) 36 -37 ). Other Greek traditions are that of Polites, a companion of Odysseus, who had a heroon near Temesa (Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 ; cf. Mele ( 1983 b )), and that of the Olympic victor Euthymos of Lokroi who fought this Polites when the Lokrians had captured the city (Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 ; cf. Paus. 6 . 6 . 4 -11 for a variant of the myth, referring also to a painting depicting personifications of the young Sybaris and of the polis of Temesa). Greek identity is suggested also by the Greek-style coinage ( infra ). All these elements suggest that Temesa was an Oinotrian city (schol. Hom. Od . 1 . 184 ), strongly Heled, prior to 510 within the dominion of Sybaris (no. 70 .I) and after 510 in the dominion of Kroton (no. 56 ), and from c. 480 , some time after the Medmean, Hipponian and Lokrian defeat of Kroton, in the dominion of Lokroi (no. 59 ). The territories of Temesa and Terina (at S. Eufemia Vetere(?), cf. Terina (no. 73 )) were adjacent (Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 ); Temesa is often located in the area of the estuary of the river Savuto, ancient Sabutus ( supra ). Sybaris controlled the valleys of the rivers Krathis and Sabutus and the access to the Tyrrhenian Sea, and so Temesa may have been within Sybaris' dominion. After Kroton's victory over Sybaris, Temesa seems to have become a part of Kroton's dominion, as indicated by its coinage ( infra ). It was later held by Lokroi, as suggested by the traditions associated with Euthymos ( supra ); numismatic evidence dates Lokrian control to C5m ( infra ), whereas dates based upon written evidence point rather to c. 480 , in which case it was followed by a new period of Krotoniate influence (see De Sensi Sestito ( 1982 a) for a full discussion). Temesa with Kroton struck silver coins on the Achaian standard. Initially, i.e. C6l, it was an incuse coinage with the tripod of Kroton and legends in the Achaian script: ΤΕ (sometimes retrograde) and /KoppaΡΟ , one issue with the rev . type: flying eagle, contemporary with the 'dominioncoinage' of Kroton (see the entry for Kroton, infra ; Stazio ( 1982 ) 96 -99 ; Parise ( 1982 ) 107 -10 , ( 1990 a); Rutter, HN ³ p. 167 ); dumpy flan incuse issues (similar type and legend) of c. 480 are also known (Stazio ( 1982 ) 98 ). From C5m Temesa struck double-relief staters: obv . tripod of Kroton; rev . Corinthian helmet, the emblem of Temesa, legend: ΤΕ or ΤΕΜ on obv . and rev . (Stazio ( 1982 ) 94 -95 , 99 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2566 ; SNG Cop.Italy 1828 ).A Krotoniate C5s issue of doublerelief staters has obv . tripod, legend /KoppaΡΟ , rev . Corinthian helmet, legend ΤΕ ; lower denominations are without ΤΕ , but the rev . type ensures their attribution to this group (Stazio ( 1982 ) 96 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2122 -24 ). The affiliation of Temesa to Kroton is clear and the evidence suggests that Temesa was part of the Krotoniate dominion from C6l, though from C5m less dependent upon Kroton, as possibly reflected in the tradition of Lokrian influence ( supra ; Prontera ( 1982 ) 42 , 47 ; De Sensi Sestito and Valentini ( 1990 ))."

Spadea ( 1990 a )) though most often located at S. Eufemia Lamezia (thus Barr . with query). Size of territory: ? Type: [A]. The toponym is Τέρινα ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 45 ( 356 / 5 ); Ps.-Skylax 12 ), or Τέρεινα (Lycoph. Alex . 726 ; Ps.-Skymnos 306 ). The city-ethnic is Τεριναῖος (C5l coins, infra ; IG ii² 10438 (C4m)) or Τερειναῖος ([Plut.] X orat . 845 C (rC4s)). Terina is one of ten toponyms listed at Ps.-Skylax 12 after the heading πόλεις εισιgraveν ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense (cf. Polyaen. 2 . 10 . 1 (rC5s); Diod. 16 . 15 . 2 (r 356 / 5 )). The internal collective use of the cityethnic is found on C5 coins ( infra ); the external collective use is found in Polyaen. 2 . 10 . 1 (rC5s); the external individual use is found in IG ii² 10438 (C4m) and [Plut.] X orat . 845 C (rC4s). Terina was founded by Kroton (no. 56 ) (Ps.-Skymnos 306 -7 ; Phlegon ( FGrHist 257 ) fr. 31 ); the date of foundation is unknown, and the terminus ante quem is c. 460 , the date at which the city began issuing coins (Rutter ( 1997 ) 61 ). T erina may have been founded after the Krotoniate defeat of Sybaris c. 510 (De Sensi Sestito ( 1985 ) 199 -200 ); if the foundation was earlier, it probably antedated the C7 -C6f Lokrian foundations of Hipponion (no. 53 ) and Medma (no. 60 ) (Spadea ( 1979 ); Giangiulio ( 1989 ) 233 -38 ). After c. 510 , Sybaritan influence in the area was replaced by Krotoniate influence, as demonstrated by coin hoards (De Sensi Sestito ( 1985 )). A war with Thourioi (no. 74 ) is attested a few years after 444 / 3 (Polyaen. 2 . 10 . 1 ). T erina was besieged and taken by the Brettians in 356 (Diod. 16 . 15 . 2 ), and the city became a Brettian community, surviving the conquest of Alexander the Molossian c. 325 (Livy 8 . 24 . 4 ). A citizen of Terina served as theorodokos of Epidauros (no. 348 ) in 356 / 5 ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 45 ). An inscribed bronze plaque (of C4 or later) found near S. Eufemia Lamezia has been tentatively attributed to Terina ( IGSII no. 21 ); in l. 10 it mentions a πρυacuteτανις , an office known also from Kroton (Ath. 522 C (rC5e)). The same inscription possibly attests the existence of a system of civic subdivisions of a territorial disposition (Jones, POAG 167 -68 ). Terina was presumably fortified in 356 / 5 when it was besieged by the Brettians ( εκπολιορκεῖν : Diod. 16 . 15 . 2 ). C5 -C4 ( infra ) coins attest to cults of the eponymous nymph and Nike, who seem to have become assimilated (Lacroix ( 1965 ) 126 ; Rutter ( 1997 ) 61 -62 ). A cult of the local nymph Pandina may be indicated by C4 bronze issues, perhaps reflecting the influence of Hipponion (Giannelli ( 1963 ) 171 -74 ). In all probability, a citizen of Terina was victorious at Olympia in 392 : the victor's full name has been corrupted, but Africanus gives Τεριναῖος as his first name, and the victor was thus probably from Terina (see Olympionikai 376 ). Terina commenced minting c. 460 ; c. 460 -440 there are three main issues of staters and fractions on the Achaian standard: (a) staters: obv . head of river-nymph Terina, legend: ΤΕΡΙΝΑ ; rev . standing wingless Nike holding branch, legend: ΝΙΚΑ , within an olive wreath (Holloway and Jenkins ( 1983 ) no. 1 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2567 ); (b) staters: obv . as above, but later style; rev . standing winged Nike with branch and wreath (Holloway and Jenkins ( 1983 ) nos. 2 -3 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2568 ); (c) staters: similar types, but Nike on rev . has raised arms (Holloway and Jenkins ( 1983 ) no. 4 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2569 ; SNG Cop.Italy 1994 ). Smaller denominations are drachms: obv . as above, legend ΤΕΡΕΙ ; rev . winged Nike standing facing; diobols have legend ΤΕΡΕ cruciform on rev . (Holloway and Jenkins ( 1983 ) nos. 6 -8 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2571 -73 ). By C5l and C4f types are obv . head of Terina; rev . winged Nike seated on amphora, cippus or four-legged seat in various attitudes and holding various attributes (ball, bird, kerykeion ), on some issues a phiale with which she pours a libation or draws water from a fountain-a merging of the river-nymph Terina and Nike. From c. 440 , legend ΤΕΡΙΝΑΙΟΝ ; on C4f issues legend ΤΕΡΙΝΑΙΩΝ , and, on some issues, rev . ΤΕΡΙΝΑ (Holloway and Jenkins ( 1983 ) 10 -93 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2574 ff, 2627 ff; SNG Cop. Italy 1995 -2013 ; SNG Cop. Suppl . 58 ). Smaller fractions are drachms,triobols,diobols and obols, with similar types and legends: ΤΕ , ΤΕΡΕ , ΤΕΡΙ (Holloway and Jenkins ( 1983 ) 25 -29 , 70 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2631 -32 , 2634 -42 ; SNG Cop. Italy 2014 -27 ). Bronze coinage was introduced C4l (Holloway and Jenkins ( 1983 ) nos. 119 -28 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2644 ff), with similar types ( SNG Cop. Italy 2032 -34 ), or with rev . crab, or hare, or hippocamp ( SNG Cop. Italy 2035 -41 ); other types: obv . lion mask; rev . head of Apollo ( SNG Cop. Suppl . 59 ); one issue has obv . head of goddess Pandina, legend: ΠΑΝ∆ΙΝΑ , shared with coins of Hipponion; rev . winged seated Nike (Holloway and Jenkins ( 1983 ) no. 125 ; Rutter, HN ³ 2650 )."

An . 5 . 1 . 2 , IG ii² 8895 (C4m), CID ii 23 . 8 ( 341 / 0 ) and I.Lindos 2 .C. 38 (C1 rC5 ). The foundation of Thourioi was the outcome of a process which began with an appeal in 446 by refugee Sybarites (Diod. 11 . 90 . 3 -4 ) to Sparta (no. 345 ) and Athens (no. 361 ) for assistance and reinforcement in their attempt to re-create their city and community in the face of Krotoniate opposition (Diod. 12 . 10 . 3 ; for the sources of Diodorus, see Rutter ( 1973 ) and De Sensi Sestito ( 1976 ); see also Sybaris (no. 70 .IV)). This request was granted by the Athenians, who sent ten ships, partly manned by Peloponnesians (Diod. 12 . 10 . 4 ; Ehrenberg ( 1965 ) 301 ). This expedition may have been led by the Athenians Lampon and Xenokrates (Diod. 12 . 10 . 4 ), but most scholars (cf. infra ) refer their participation to the 444 / 3 foundation of Thourioi proper ( infra ). In this initial phase of the foundation of Thourioi, Sybaris was reinforced by Athenians and Peloponnesians (Diod. 12 . 10 . 4 ), and seems indeed still to have been called, and located at, Sybaris (coins; cf. RE iv ² . 1008 ; Rutter ( 1973 ) 163 ). The community was strongly dominated by Sybarites. However, their claims to privileges in political, cultic and economic spheres of life resulted in a serious stasis , and they were put to death almost to the last man or expelled, thus paving the way for the foundation of Thourioi proper (Diod. 12 . 11 . 1 -4 ; cf. Arist. Pol . 1303 a 31 -33 ). These events probably occurred in 445 / 4 (Diod. 12 . 22 . 1 ). The foundation proper of Thourioi followed in 444 / 3 (in the archonship of Praxiteles: Ps.-Plut. X orat . 835 D; cf. Dion. Hal. Lys . 1 . 2 ). According to Diod. 12 . 11 . 3 , the victors of the stasis themselves sent to Hellas for new settlers; Ps.-Plut. X orat . 835 D seems to think that Athens was in charge of the foundation, whereas Dion. Hal. Lys . 1 . 2 says that the colonists were sent by Αθηναῖοί τε καιgrave ηasper άλλη ' Ελλάς . Diodorus'description of the initial system of phylai ( infra ) confirms that settlers had a wide variety of origins ( 12 . 11 . 3 ; cf. 12 . 35 . 1 : εκ πολλῶν πόλεων ; on Athens'role in the foundation, see Rutter ( 1973 ) 164 -67 , arguing that it has been exaggerated). It was, presumably, this second group of colonists from the mainland that was led by Lampon and Xenokrates (cf. Kagan ( 1969 ) 158 ; De Sensi Sestito ( 1984 a ) 81 ), though Diod. 12 . 10 . 4 is then guilty of confusion unless these men led both expeditions. Lampon is named as the oikistes by Plut. Mor . 812 D, though other sources describe him as a mantis or exegetes (see refs. in Kagan ( 1969 ) 168 n. 36 ) performing only a temporary task (see Graham ( 1964 ) 36 -37 ; Leschhorn ( 1984 ) 132 -33 ; and Malkin ( 1987 ) 254 -57 ). The identity of the oecist was, in fact, a matter of dispute which in 434 led to a stasis that was solved by reference to the Delphic oracle, which declared that Apollo himself should be recognised as the oecist (Diod. 12 . 35 . 3 ). The name of the territory was ηasper Θουρία (Thuc. 6 . 61 . 7 ) or Θουριαgraveς γηtilde (Thuc. 7 . 35 . 1 ); it is termed χώρα at Arist. Pol . 1307 a 29 ff. Almost immediately after its foundation the city engaged in extensive warfare, presumably to secure control of a sizeable territory.The Spartan exile Kleandridas became a citizen of Thourioi (Thuc. 6 . 104 . 2 ) and led campaigns against Terina (no. 73 ) (Polyaen. 2 . 10 . 1 ), and this may attest to territorial ambitions on the Tyrrhenian coast. Kleandridas also led Thourian forces against the Leukanians (Polyaen. 2 . 10 . 2 ) and was likewise the commander in a war against Taras (no. 71 ) (Diod. 12 . 23 . 2 (r 444 )) in which both cities struggled for influence in the Siritis (Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 11 ). Dedications by Taras at Olympia c. 440 of spoils taken from Thourioi ( IvO 254 -56 = ML 57 ) attest to some Tarantine success, and the territorial conflict was finally ended c. 434 by an agreement to found a joint colony, though in the name of Taras (Antiochos, loc. cit .); the colony developed into the city of Herakleia (no. 52 ). Iambl. VP 264 attests to C5s hostilities between Thourioi and Kroton (cf. Guzzo ( 1986 ) 201 ), but according to Diod. 12 . 11 . 3 Thourioi established philia with Kroton, presumably not long after the foundation. Smaller agricultural settlements, some in the form of single villas, are above all known from the C4 -C3 territory (Osanna ( 1992 ) 148 -49 ; Guzzo ( 1997 ) 379 ). The border between Thourian and Leukanian/Brettian territory is not very clear; the southern Brettian site at Castiglione di Paludi is interpreted as a Brettian military installation (Osanna ( 1992 ) 146 -49 ; De Sensi Sestito ( 1992 ) 350 -53 ). The border was marked by a row of Thourian phrouria , such as the one at Torre Mordillo, where a lead seal carrying the inscription ΘΟΥ [-] has been found (Colburn ( 1977 ) 478 , 521 ), and the one at Sierra Castello (Guzzo ( 1986 ) 203 ). One phrourion is known by name: Lagaria, located somewhere inland µ εταgrave Θουρίους (Strabo 6 . 1 . 14 ), as yet not identified with certainty but sometimes identified with the settlement at Amendolara (cf. de La Genière ( 1991 b )). Phrouroi , presumably the personnel manning these installations, are referred to by Arist. Pol . 1307 b 9 . Nothing is known of the size of the population, the only available figures being army numbers ( infra ). Thourioi was a member of the Italiote League (Diod. 14 . 91 . 1 (r 393 ) and 101 . 1 (r 390 ); Staatsverträge 230 ). Some kind of treaty with Kroton (no. 56 ) soon after the foundation is implied by Diod. 12 . 11 . 3 . The C5s bronze kerykeion inscribed δα µ όσιον Θουρίων , δα µ όσιον Βρενδεσίνων and found at Brindisi ( IG xiv 672 ) may also testify to some formalised collaboration between the two communities, possibly during the conflict between Taras and Thourioi in the period prior to the foundation of Herakleia in 434 (Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 11 ; De Simone ( 1956 )). This conflict itself was also ended by a treaty (Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 11 = Staatsverträge 158 ). According to Thuc. 7 . 33 . 6 , Athens (no. 361 ) in 413 negotiated for a full alliance with Thourioi; whether a treaty was concluded is unclear, but Thourioi did assist the Athenian effort against Syracuse (no. 47 ) (Thuc. 7 . 35 . 1 , 57 . 11 ; cf. Diod. 13 . 11 . 1 (r 413 )). However, after the Athenian defeat at Syracuse, Thourioi is found assisting Sparta (no. 345 ) with naval forces (Thuc. 8 . 35 . 1 , 61 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 5 . 9 ), which implies a treaty. In 389 the city suffered a severe defeat by the Leukanians but managed to conclude peace via the mediation of Leptines of Syracuse (Diod. 14 . 101 . 1 -102 . 3 ). A little after 379 , Dionysios I sent a navy against Thourioi without success (Ael. VH 12 . 61 with Jacquemin ( 1979 )). Collaboration with Corinthian forces sent out to reinforce Timoleon is attested at Plut. Tim . 16 . 2 . In 356 the city was subdued by the Brettians (Diod. 16 . 15 . 2 ; cf. Plut. Tim . 16 . 2 ). In 413 , Thourioi assisted the Athenian attack on Syracuse with 700 hoplites and 300 akontistai (Thuc. 7 . 35 . 1 ). Naval forces (ten ships) are attested at Thuc. 8 . 35 . 1 , commanded by Dorieus tritos autos (cf. Thuc. 8 . 61 . 2 and Xen. Hell . 1 . 5 . 19 ). A contingent of 14 , 000 pezoi and c. 1 , 000 horse is recorded by Diod. 14 . 101 . 2 (r 390 ). A board of strategoi was elected by the assembly ( τοgraveν δηtilde µ ον . . . χειροτονήσοντα ); a law stipulated a five-year period between strategiai ; but the law was repealed, and this started off a process by which the constitution developed into a dynasteia of the young reformers (Arist. Pol . 1307 b 6 -19 ). Plato may allude to this event at Leg . 636 B, where he describes gymnasia and sysitia as breeding grounds of young citizens inclined to revolution. The Spartan exile Kleandridas became a citizen of Thourioi (Thuc. 6 . 104 . 2 ; Plut. Per . 22 . 3 ) and served as strategos in wars against Taras (Strabo 6 . 1 . 14 ), T erina and the Leukanians (Polyaen. 2 . 10 . 1 -2 ). Reception of envoys is recorded by Thuc. 6 . 104 . 2 and sending of envoys at Diod. 14 . 101 . 2 (r 390 ). F.Delphes iii . 4 388 ( 325 -300 ) may possibly be a grant by Delphi (no. 177 ) of proxeny, etc. to a man of Thourioi. A man of Thourioi was granted hereditary citizenship and other honours by Zeleia (no. 764 ) in the Propontis c. 330 -300 ( AM 9 ( 1884 ) 58 -60 no. 3 = Michel 531 ). Theorodokoi of Epidauros (no. 348 ) at Thourioi are attested by IG iv² . 1 95 . ii . 43 , 52 (C4m). A system of phylai was established soon after the foundation, in which the citizens were enrolled on the basis of their origin; the ten phylai were named: Arkas, Achaïs, Eleia, Boiotia, Amphiktyonis, Doris, Ias, Athenaïs, Euboïs and Nesiotis (Diod. 12 . 11 . 3 ; see Jones, POAG 165 -67 ). According to Diod. 12 . 11 . 3 -4 , Thourioi was founded as a democracy, and the city's law code was drawn up by Charondas of Thourioi (apparently a namesake of the famous legislator of the Archaic period, pace Mühl, Klio 22 ( 1929 ) 439 ), but Heraclid.Pont.tells us that it was Protagoras of Abdera who wrote the laws (fr. 150 , Wehrli = Diog. Laert. 9 . 8 . 50 ). It has been suggested that he based his laws on those of Charondas and Zaleukos (De Sensi Sestito ( 1984 a ) 82 ). Several staseis are recorded (Berger ( 1992 ) 33 -34 ); one involved the identity of the oecist (Diod. 12 . 35 . 3 (r 434 )) and in another anti-Athenians were defeated and exiled (Thuc. 7 . 33 . 5 -6 ; Berger ( 1992 ) 33 ). In 413 , however, after the Athenian defeat at Syracuse, 300 pro-Athenians were exiled, one of them Lysias (Dion. Hal. Lys . 1 ; Plut. Mor . 835 E). Aristotle refers to two further staseis , both perhaps posterior to 413 : the first ( Pol . 1307 a 27 -33 ) is given as an example of change from oligarchy in the direction of democracy: the passage testifies to the existence of a property qualification for office holding ( archai ); the qualification was lowered and the number of magistracies ( archeia ) increased after pressure from the demos ; the chronological reference is uncertain (De Sensi Sestito ( 1992 ) 344 ff: 440 s; Berger ( 1992 ) 33 -34 : c. 413 ). The city seems to have attempted control of land ownership,even among its own citizens;but large landholdings were acquired unconstitutionally by the gnorimoi and had to be given up by the owners after a stasis (Arist. Pol . 1307 a 29 -33 ; Jacquemin ( 1979 )). The second passage ( Pol . 1307 b 6 -19 ) describes a process by which the constitution developed (from a democracy?) into a dynasteia of young military leaders ( supra ); the chronological reference is again uncertain. The passage testifies to the existence of symboloi : they seem to have been entrusted with general supervision of the constitution; the passage also refers to archontes in general. Thourioi was situated on part of the site of Archaic Sybaris (no. 70 .I), and the assertion by Diod. 12 . 10 . 3 (cf. Strabo 6 . 1 . 13 ) that the city was moved to another site is not convincing in view of the archaeological evidence. According to Diod. 12 . 10 . 6 (rC5s), the city had a circuit wall, not archaeologically attested so far. The city was laid out with four plateiai and three stenopoi , named respectively Herakleia, Aphrodisia, Olympias, Dionysias, and Heroa, Thuria, Thurina (Diod. 12 . 10 . 7 ; Castagnoli ( 1971 ); for the textual problems, see Vallet ( 1976 ) 1030 -32 ; Lapini ( 1997 )). Hippodamos is called Thourian in some traditions, and the town plan of Thourioi has been attributed to him, though the tradition is ambiguous (see e.g. E. Greco ( 1997 )). Whether the streets named by Diodorus correspond to twelve city quarters distributed to the tribes, also listed by Diodorus ( supra ), is doubtful (Vallet ( 1976 ) 1027 -28 ), but the overall orthogonal urban layout as described by Diodorus has found confirmation in the archaeological evidence: the C5l-C4f city plan was orthogonal, and the sporadic remains of habitation are oriented according to the urban layout ( infra ; cf. E. Greco ( 1997 ) 437 -38 ; recent investigation of Hippodamian layout: E. Greco and Luppino ( 1999 )). The technique of construction of the sparse habitation remains is rather similar to that of Archaic Sybaris (Guzzo ( 1988 -89 ) 20 -23 , 87 , 178 , 240 -48 , 290 -304 , 365 ). There are overall traces of a levelling of the remains of the Sybarite phase in preparation for the foundation of Thourioi (ibid. 23 ). An east-west-oriented plateia , going back to the time of foundation (ibid. 20 ), terminated near the coast in C4 (?) harbour structures of uncertain use (Zancani Montuoro ( 1972 -73 b )). Remains of public architecture are meagre, and the extant structures are mainly ascribable to Roman Copia. The agora is mentioned at Theophr. fr. 97 , but the tradition that Herodotos was buried there is rejected outright by Jacoby ( RE suppl.ii. 214 ), although there can be no doubt that Herodotos was a citizen of Thourioi (Arist. Rh . 1409 a 28 ) and probably moved to Thourioi in 444 / 3 (Plut. Mor . 604 F). A cult of Athena may be inferred from coin types ( infra ). A cult of Boreas was instituted by decree in C4f (Ael. VH 12 . 61 ) after this divinity had wrecked a navy of Dionysios I on its way to Thourioi; Boreas was voted citizenship, and an annual festival instituted (Jacquemin ( 1979 )). The cults of Sybaris and Thourioi are not always easily separated (cf. Giannelli ( 1963 ) 101 -16 ). The cult of Hera is documented for Sybaris (see Sybaris (no. 70 .I)) and may have continued in Thourioi, though the coin type of Hera Lakinia ( infra ) probably has no connection with the Sybarite cult of Hera (cf. Giannelli ( 1963 ) 103 ). C3 numismatic evidence may suggest at least C3 cults of Apollo, Demeter and Artemis ( SNG Cop. Italy 1507 -10 , 1513 -18 ). A cult of Apollo is also suggested by the tradition of Apollo as the oikistes ( supra ; and cf. Giannelli ( 1963 ) 105 ). The division of Thourioi into quarters by streets named after Herakles, Aphrodite, the Olympian Zeus and Dionysos (Diod. 12 . 10 . 7 ) may indicate cults of these divinities.A cult of Diomedes at Thourioi is attested at Polemon, FGH iii 122 no. 23 . Communal consultation of the Delphic oracle is recorded in Diod. 12 . 35 . 3 (r 434 ). Syll . ³ 295 (C4 ) is a Delphic decree ## II. The Poleis"
75,Adria,The Adriatic,45.05,12.05,823,4244,"75 . Adria Map. 40 . Lat. 45 . 05 , long. 12 . 05 . Size of territory: ? Type: C: β . The toponym is Αδρία , ηasper (Hecat. fr. 90 ; Strabo 5 . 1 . 8 , MSS) or Ατρία (Strabo 5 . 1 . 8 ; Steph. Byz. 143 . 16 ). The only source for a city-ethnic is Steph. Byz. 29 . 3 -4 . Hsch. s.v. Αδριανοί refers to the Celtic tribes living along the coastline of the Adriatic. Adria is called a polis in the urban sense by Strabo, once illustrious, but in his own times a polismation ( 5 . 1 . 8 (rC5 -C4 )); in Hecat. fr. 90 we have no guarantee that the classification of Adria as a polis stems from Hekataios. Adria was possibly a C6l foundation of Aigina (no. 358 ), as indicated by some of the C5f dedicatory graffiti in the Aiginetan alphabet from the site, combined with Strabo 8 . 6 . 16 : αποίκους δ ' έστειλαν Αιγινηtildeται είς . . . ' Ο µ βρικουacuteς (Colonna ( 1974 ); Dubois, IGDGG pp. 181 -87 ); however, a graffito in the Ionic alphabet is also known from the site (Johnston ( 1979 )). The foundation myths are linked with the local dynast Adrios, son of Ionios (Theopomp. fr. 128 ) or with Diomedes (Steph. Byz. 143 . 16 , see supra 000 ). In C4f Adria was, apparently, refounded by Dionysios I (Theopomp. fr. 128 ; Tzetzes ad Lycophr. 631 ; Etym. Magn. 18 . 54 -57 ). According to Just. Epit . 20 . 1 . 9 , Adria was a Greek foundation ( Graeca urbs ); whereas the city was founded by the Etruscans according to Plutarch and other Roman sources (Plut. Cam . 16 ; Livy 5 . 33 . 7 ; Plin. HN 3 . 120 ). Adria rose alongside an ancient branch of the river Po (between the Adige and the Po), in the territory of the Henetikians (Venetians) (implicitly Strabo 5 . 1 . 7 ), today about 25 km from the coast of the Adriatic Sea, which took its name from the city (Strabo 5 . 1 . 8 ; cf. also 7 . 5 . 9 ), if not from the river Adria (Steph. Byz. 28 . 14 -15 ). If the conjecture of an Aiginetan foundation ( supra ) is valid, Adria lay in the territory of the Ombriakians (Umbrians). However, the borderline between Venetian and Umbrian territory is rather fluid (cf. Colonna ( 1974 ) 11 -12 ) and, according to Steph. Byz. 143 . 16 , Adria was situated in Tyrrhenia. There are no extant urban Greek remains, though there are vestiges of housing structures in wood, as known from Venetian palafittic habitation structures. Attic sherds from the settlement area attest contact with the Greek world already from C6f, culminating in C5 -C4 , but decreasing in the course of C4 (Colonna ( 1974 ) 5 ; Giangiulio ( 1984 ) 44 ), and there is no archaeological evidence of a c. 385 foundation by Dionysios I. By C4m Adria fell victim to invasions by the Gauls (Ps.-Skylax 18 . 2 , see Colonna ( 1974 ) 11 -12 ; Peretti ( 1979 ) 201 -2 ). Dedicatory graffiti to Apollo ( IGDGG no. 70 ) and Eris(?) ( IGDGG no. 72 ) have revealed a Greek sanctuary, no other language being represented among the finds (Colonna ( 1974 ) 8 -10 ). The archaeological evidence, including the nomenclature of the graffiti, suggests that C4Syracusan settlers at Adria were anticipated by settlers from Aigina. Evidence of public works is scarce; the philistina fossa of Plin. HN 3 . 16 . 120 -21 has tentatively been interpreted as a canal or drainage system built by Philistos the Syracusan sent into exile by Dionysios I, with his residence at Adria(?). The evidence is tenuous, and Philistos may have been exiled in the Adriatic generally speaking or at Epeiros (Wikén ( 1937 ) 144 -45 ; cf. Fogolari and Scarfi ( 1970 ) 36 n. 23 ). Extensive cemeteries east, south and south-west of the settlement are mainly C4 and Roman.Tombs from the Archaic period are so far rarely attested (Giangiulio ( 1984 ) 43 ). Asfor the Late Classical period,it should be noted that the tradition found in Just. Epit 20 . 1 . 9 : Adria . . . Graeca urbs , reflects the undoubted presence of Greeks at Adria, and the Greek foundation myth according to which Adria was founded by Diomedes ( supra ) may reflect a C4 attempt to legitimise Syracuse's Adriatic empire (Briquel ( 1987 ) 257 -59 ). Most likely we have to do with a Greek trading station in Etruscan-Venetian territory-the pre-Roman finds have revealed very strong ties with Etruscan culture; from C4s the site was occupied by the Gauls."
76,Ankon (Ankonites),The Adriatic,43.35,13.3,538,2734,"76 . Ankon (Ankonites) Map 42 . Lat. 43 . 35 , long. 13 . 30 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: β , see infra . The toponym is Αγκών , ο (Ps.-Skylax 16 ; Strabo 6 . 3 . 10 ). The city-ethnic is Ανκωνείτης ( I.Dyrrh . 20 (C2 -C1 )) or Αγκωνίτης ( SGDI 2612 . 3 ; Steph. Byz. 18 . 17 -18 , quoting Artemidoros). Ankon is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 16 and described retrospectively as a πόλις ' Ελληνίς by Strabo 5 . 4 . 2 (r 387 ). The internal and collective use of the city-ethnic is probably attested in abbreviated form on some C3 -C2 bronze coins ( ΑΓΚΩΝ , SNG Cop. Italy 82 -83 ). The external and individual use is found in a Delphic proxeny decree of 167 ( SGDI 2612 . 3 ). According to Strabo 5 . 4 . 2 , Ankon was colonised c. 387 by Syracusan refugees who had fled from Dionysios I, but the city may have been part of Dionysios' Adriatic empire, and he may have been responsible for the settlement (Woodhead ( 1970 ) 511 -12 ; Braccesi ( 1977 ) 220 -22 ).According to Plin. HN 3 . 111 , Ankon was, with Numana, a foundation of the Sikeloi, and according to Catullus ( 36 . 13 ) and Juvenal ( 4 . 40 ), the city was a Doric foundation. Strabo 5 . 4 . 2 locates Ankon in Pikenian territory, Ps.-Skylax 16 among the Umbrians. Braccesi and others seem to hold that Ankon was a Greek trading post, possibly strengthened during the reign of Dionysios I and his expansion into the Adriatic, but not a colonial foundation with a well-defined urban layout (Braccesi ( 1977 ) 220 -23 , 246 ); cf. Spina (no. 85 ) and Adria (no. 75 ). The C7 indigenous settlement rose on a coastal, bowshaped promontory which enclosed a harbour (Strabo 5 . 4 . 2 ; settlement history: Luni ( 1995 ) 193 -96 fig. 4 ). The settlement consisted of an acropolis with a sanctuary and, below, a town comprising both a public area and a habitation areaat least in Roman times. There are remains of a C4 circuit wall fortifying the acropolis (Sebastiani ( 1983 )). The urban remains are mainly Roman, but there are sporadic finds of Greek sherds, mainly Attic of C6 -C5 . The remains of a Greek temple on the acropolis have been dated to the period of Dionysios I, c. 380 -370 , or to the period of Agathokles, 316 -289 (Bacchielli ( 1985 ); D'Andria ( 2002 ) 120 -22 ). The sources suggest a temple dedicated to Aphrodite, perhaps Euploia. But by analogy with various Dorian/Corinthian Aphrodite sanctuaries, Cordano ( 1993 ) prefers Aphrodite Akraia; cf. Juvenal ( 4 . 40 ) and Catullus ( 36 . 16 . 13 ) and the obverse type of the C3s-C2 coins ( SNG Cop. Italy 82 -83 ). It has recently been suggested that the Syracusan (Dionysian) settlement was located on the neighbouring hill of Montagnolo ( EAA sec. suppl. 1971 -94 1 ( 1994 ) 224 )."
77,Apollonia (Apolloniates),The Adriatic,40.45,19.3,1753,8918,"77 . Apollonia (Apolloniates) Map 49 . Lat. 40 . 45 , long. 19 . 30 . Size of territory: probably 5 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Απολλωνία , ηasper (Hdt. 9 . 92 -93 ; I.Apoll. 303 = CEG 390 (C5m)). The city-ethnic is Απολλωνιάτης (Hdt. 9 . 92 . 2 ; CID ii 4 . i . 18 ( 360 )). Apollonia is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 9 . 93 . 1 , 94 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 26 ) and in the political sense (Arist. Pol . 1290 b 11 -12 ). In the accounts of the Delphic naopoioi , Apollonia is listed under the heading πόλεις καιgrave ιδιῶται ( CID ii 4 . i . 14 , ii . 1 -22 ( 360 )). The citizens are described as astoi in Hdt. 9 . 93 -94 . The collective use of the ethnic is attested externally in the dedication on a victory memorial set up by the Apolloniates at Olympia ( CEG 390 = I.Apoll . 303 ), also cited by Paus. 5 . 22 . 3 (cf. infra ), and in CEG 809 = I.Apoll . 307 (C4m). The individual use of the ethnic is attested externally in literary sources (Hdt. 9 . 92 . 2 ) and in inscriptions ( F.Delphes iii . 1 4 . 3 = I.Apoll . 304 (C4f); IG ii² 350 . 10 = SEG 35 77 (C4s)). According to Thuc. 1 . 26 . 2 , Apollonia was founded by Corinthians (no. 227 ) only (cf. Braccesi ( 1977 ) 92 n. 4 ), and according to Plut. Mor . 552 E the contingent was led by Periander,which suggests a date of c. 600 for the foundation. According to a variant tradition, a contingent of 200 Corinthians was led by one Gylax, after whom the city was named Gylakeia (Steph. Byz. 105 . 22 , 214 . 9 -10 ; cf. Γυαλεῖον πεδίον in a second century ad inscription from Apollonia, I.Apoll . 213 ). Alternatively, Ps.-Skymnos 439 -40 and Strabo 7 . 5 . 8 claim that Apollonia was founded by colonists from Corinth and Korkyra (no. 123 ) ( I.Dyrrh . 29 ). In Pol . 1303 a 25 -28 , 36 -38 , Aristotle adduces Apollonia as an (undated) example of stasis caused by the arrival of new colonists. The foundation myth told by the Apolloniates was that their city had been founded by Apollo ( CEG 390 = I.Apoll . 303 = Paus. 5 . 22 . 3 ; cf. coins of the Roman period (Head, HN ² 314 )). The tradition mentioning Periander indicates that the foundation took place during his reign, although his personal involvement remains uncertain (cf. Berve ( 1967 ) 21 ; Salmon ( 1984 ) 211 ; foundation chronology c. 600 : Van Compernolle ( 1953 ); Ducat ( 1962 ) 174 -78 ). The foundation of Apollonia and Epidamnos (no. 79 ) probably reflects Corinthian expansion in the Adriatic after the subjugation of Korkyra (Salmon ( 1984 ) 222 -24 ) and Corinthian trade attracted by the mineral wealth of the region (Braccesi ( 1977 ) 98 -103 ). The lack of Protocorinthian pottery confirms a foundation date of c. 600 (Mano ( 1983 ) 232 -34 ; Apollonia d'Illyrie iv . 855 ). The population was Hellenic, and the colonists from Corinth and Korkyra were reinforced by most of the inhabitants of Dyspontion (no. 250 ) near Olympia, who are said to have fled to Epidamnos and Apollonia after the destruction of their city c. 570 (Strabo 8 . 3 . 32 ; Ducat ( 1962 ) 175 -76 ). The growth and territorial aspirations of Apollonia may have led to conflict with neighbouring settlements, such as the C5m war with Thronion in the Abantis attested in the inscription from Olympia (also cited by Paus. 5 . 22 . 3 ) which commemorates spoils taken from Thronion by the Apolloniates ( I.Apoll . 303 (C5m); cf. Hammond ( 1967 ) 493 -95 ). Paus. 5 . 22 . 4 records that spoils were also given to the Corinthians. For Apollonia's dominance over Thronion and Byllis (no. 92 ), see Hammond ( 1967 ) 523 . In the conflict between Corinth and Korkyra in 435 Apollonia sided with Corinth (Thuc. 1 . 26 . 2 ; see Salmon ( 1984 ) 274 -80 ). In C4m the Apolloniates are listed in the Corinthian inscription commemorating Timoleon's victory over Carthage at the river Krimissos in 344 ( CEG 809 = I.Apoll . 307 ; see Talbert ( 1974 ) 76 -77 ). The constitution was organised democratically, but offices of state were restricted to the descendants of the original colonists, who constituted a minority of the citizens (Arist. Pol . 1290 b 11 -14 ). This peculiar form of democracy may have been preceded by an oligarchy which was overturned because the ruling oligarchs embezzled public money (Arist. Pol . 1305 b 39 -40 with 1306 a 6 -9 ). However, the chronology is uncertain, and the sequence of constitutions may have been the opposite (cf. Aubonnet in the Budé edn., p. 161 n. 5 ). The polis was famous for its good laws ( ευνο µ ωτάτη , Strabo 7 . 5 . 8 ), and is reputed to have practised expulsion of foreigners ( xenelasia ) on the Spartan model (Ael. VH 13 . 15 ). There is a C4s Delphic proxeny decree for a citizen of Apollonia ( I.Apoll . 310 ), and an Apolloniate is granted isopoliteia in the Molossian kingdom by a federal decree of c. 343 -331 ( I.Apoll . 308 ). Apollonia figures in the C4s Argive list of theorodokoi as one of the most northerly cities of the itinerary ( SEG 23 189 . i . 14 = I.Apoll . 309 ). Communal oracle consultations at Dodona and Delphi are reported in an anecdote told at Hdt. 9 . 93 -95 ; cf. Fontenrose ( 1978 ) Q 161 . Meneptolemos of Apollonia was victorious in the boys' race c. 504 -500 (Paus. 6 . 14 . 13 ; Olympionikai 162 ). The colony was founded near the coast, εν τΩsubiotaῶ ' ΙωνίΩsubiotaω κόλπΩsubiotaω (Hdt. 9 . 92 . 2 ), in the land of the Taulantioi (Ps.Skylax 26 ), and now lies between the estuaries of the river Seman (ancient Apsos) and the river Vjosë (ancient Aous) at modern Pojani in southern Albania (morphology and site plan: Apollonia d'Illyrie i. 523 -26 fig. 3 ). The name of the territory was ηasper Απολλωνία χώρα (Hdt. 9 . 93 . 1 , 94 . 2 ). Coin finds show that C4 Apollonia had contacts over a wide territory, perhaps as extensive as modern Albania (Mano ( 1976 ) fig. 3 ). There are traces of indigenous settlements and ancient routes in the territory (Praschniker ( 1922 -24 ) fig. 2 ), remains of a C4 Doric temple of unknown cult at Stylassi c. 800 m south of the city, no longer extant (Praschniker ( 1922 -24 ) 40 -42 fig. 14 ; I.Dyrrh . 14 ), and some indications of a river harbour on the Aous (Praschniker ( 1922 -24 ) 55 -57 ). Most of the urban remains are Heltic or Roman, and are dispersed along the crest and on the slopes of the range of hills on which the city was founded. A C6 ? ashlar circuit wall fortified the acropolis and upper settlement area ( c. 20 ha). The lower city ( c. 110 ha) was protected by an extensive C4 -C3 ashlar and brick circuit wall, furnished with a number of gates (Koch ( 1989 ) 218 -20 ; Apollonia d'Illyrie ii. 763 -78 ; Apollonia d'Illyrie iii. 977 -85 ; Apollonia d'Illyrie iv. 857 -60 ); the city withstood sieges in C4l (Diod. 19 . 70 . 7 (r 314 ); 81 . 1 (r 312 )). A C6s Doric hexastyle temple was raised on the southern peak of the acropolis; fragments of a C6sculptural frieze reveal Ionic traits. The cult was that of Apollo ( I.Apoll . 315 . 51 ) and possibly Artemis ( Apollonia d'Illyrie i. 529 ). Public buildings below the acropolis consist of a C4s urban temple ( Apollonia d'Illyrie iii. 976 ), a C3m theatre seating c. 8 , 000 (Isler, TGR i. 227 ), C4 -C3stoas and a C3 nymphaeum (Strabo 9 . 3 . 16 ; see Koch ( 1989 ) 222 -25 ), and various structures probably from the time of Dionysios I (Lamboley ( 2002 )). There are vestiges of an urban layout dating to 450 -380 , with a street grid of 61 m × 61 m and streets 5 . 95 -6 . 30 m wide (Koch ( 1989 ) 218 -19 ). The cemeteries were laid out in the Kryegyata valley east of the city: C7l-C5 tumuli and sarcophagi, C4 -C3 chamber tombs, C3 -C1 cremation tombs (Ceka ( 1994 a ); Apollonia d'Illyrie iv. 854 -56 ). Tomb gifts and rites were similar to those at Epidamnos and Korkyra (Mano ( 1983 ) 232 ). The major cult was probably that of Apollo, as indicated by the foundation myth ( supra ) as well as the name of the city. Also, the Apolloniatans dedicated summer crops fashioned in gold to the Delphic Apollo (Plut. Mor . 402 A).Other communal cults are Helios (Hdt. 9 . 93 ) and Artemis,also fre- quently invoked ( I.Apoll . 1 , 33 ). C3l inscriptions with dedications to Artemis Limnatis and Artemis Proscopa show the importance of her cult (cf. Cabanes ( 1986 ) 152 -55 , and coin evidence). The calendar month Haliotropios ( I.Apoll . 315 . 2 ) and Psydreos ( I.Apoll . 387 (C4l)) are known also from Ambrakia, Bouthrotos, Dodona, Epidamnos and Korkyra, and suggest a Corinthian origin for the calendar (Hadzis ( 1994 ); Trümpy, Monat . 155 -59 ). Apollonia struck silver coins c. 450 -350 . Denominations: stater (didrachms), tridrachms and drachms. Korkyraian types: obv . cow suckling calf; rev . stellate squares; legend: ΑΠ ( SNG Cop. Illyricum 370 ). Bronze coins were struck from C4l. Types: obv . lyre; rev . obelisk of Apollo; legend: ΑΠΟΛΛΩΝΟΣ (Lacroix ( 1965 ) 155 ). From C4m staters on the Corinthian standard and with Corinthian types and legend: ΑΠΟΛ (Kraay ( 1976 ) 126 )."
78,Brentesion (Brendesinos),The Adriatic,40.4,18.0,444,2192,"78 . Brentesion (Brendesinos) Map. 45 . Lat. 40 . 40 , long. 18 . 00 . Size of territory: ? Type: C: β . The toponym is Βρεντέσιον , τό (Hdt. 4 . 99 . 5 ) or Βρεντήσιον ( Etym. Magn . 212 . 23 ). The city-ethnic is Βρενδεσῖνος ( IG xiv 672 (C5m)) or Βρεντέσιος (Heracl. Lemb. 56 ) or Βρεντέσινος (Polyb. 10 . 1 . 8 -9 ; Strabo 6 . 3 . 6 ). Brentesion is called a polis in late sources only, in Polyb. 10 . 1 . 9 referring to the Roman colony of C3m and retrospectively in Strabo 6 . 3 . 6 referring to the mythical period. Strabo describes Brentesion as a barbarian city in territory opposed to that of the Tarantines and with a Messapian name. However, its status as a Greek or at least partly Heled polis of the Classical period is indicated by a C5m kerykeion inscribed δα µ όσιον Θουρίων . δα µ όσιον Βρενδεσίνων ( IG xiv 672 = Jeffery, LSAG 284 no. 13 , pl. 54 ), perhaps a testimony of an alliance between Brentesion and Thourioi (De Simone ( 1956 ); Greco ( 1993 ) 302 ). Though not explicitly mentioned in the sources, Brentesion must have played a leading role in the Iapygian wars with Taras (no. 71 ) and Rhegion (no. 68 ) (Hdt. 7 . 170 . 3 ; Diod. 11 . 52 (r 473 )). The importance of its use as a port is attested in Hdt. 4 . 99 . 5 , where we find the term limen . πόλις βασιλευο µ ένη at Strabo 6 . 3 . 6 concerns the mythical period but may refer to the Messapian kingships (C5 ). A boule of the Brendisioi is known from a late source (Roman),but it is of some importance because it refers to a Greek philosopher ( IG xiv 674 ; Ghinatti ( 1996 ) 120 ). The foundation story of Brentesion has Cretan elements (Strabo 6 . 3 . 6 ), as has the origin of the Iapygians (Hdt. 7 . 170 . 2 ; Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 6 ), perhaps an indication of early Helation. According to Strabo 6 . 3 . 6 , Phalanthos of Taras settled in Brentesion when he had been exiled from Taras,a tradition perhaps reflecting early contacts between the Greek colony and Iapygia (Fantasia ( 1972 ) 119 -20 ). The epigraphic evidence is mainly Messapian, the Greek inscriptions being primarily from the Roman period. Archaeological remains are mainly Heltic (Cataldi ( 1985 ); Lamboley ( 1996 ) 58 -79 )."
79,Epidamnos (Epidamnios)/ Dyrrhachion (Dyrrachinos),The Adriatic,41.2,19.25,1658,8416,"79 . Epidamnos (Epidamnios)/ Dyrrhachion (Dyrrachinos) Map 49 . Lat. 41 . 20 , long. 19 . 25 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: α . The toponym is ' Επίδα µ νος , ηasper (Thuc. 1 . 2 . 1 ; SEG 43 335 (C6s)). The city-ethnic is ' Επιδά µ νιος (Hdt. 6 . 127 . 2 ; IG ii² 350 . 9 ( 331 / 0 ), 3052 . 2 ( 328 / 7 )). The later toponym, ∆υρράχιον (Strabo 7 . 5 . 8 ), is first attested in the C3l Delphic list of theorodokoi ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 57 ), whereas the corresponding city-ethnic, ∆υρ ( ρ ) άχινος , is attested on coins as early as C5m ( infra ). Epidamnos is called a polis in the urban sense (Thuc. 1 . 24 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 26 ), in the territorial sense (Thuc. 1 . 24 . 5 -6 ), and in the political sense (Thuc. 1 . 25 . 1 ). In Arist. Pol . 1304 a 13 -14 , Epidamnos is one of six communities subsumed under the heading polis ( 1303 b 32 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and externally in Thuc. 1 . 24 . 1 . For the individual and external use, see Α µ φί µ νηστος ' Επιστρόφου ' Επιδά µ νιος , one of the suitors of Agariste of Sikyon (Hdt. 6 . 127 . 2 (r c. 580 )), and the Attic citizenship decree for a named Epidamnian ( IG ii² 350 = SEG 35 77 (C4s)). It is implicitly described as patre ( = patris ) in Hdt. 6 . 127 . 1 -4 . Epidamnos was founded in either 627 or 625 (Hieron. Chron. 97 b, Helm) by Korkyraians (no. 123 ) (Thuc. 1 . 24 . 1 ; Ps.-Skymnos 435 -36 ) assisted by some Corinthians (no. 227 ) and other Dorians (Thuc. 1 . 24 . 2 ). The oecist was Φαλίος ' Ερατοκλείδου Κορίνθιος , a descendant of Herakles, and he was summoned from Korkyra's metropolis in accordance with ancestral traditions (Thuc. 1 . 24 . 2 ). Epidamnos and Apollonia (no. 77 ) were the only true C7 colonies in the Adriatic, the outcome of Corinthian expansion and trade attracted by the mineral wealth of the region (Braccesi ( 1977 ) 98 -103 ). In c. 570 inhabitants from the destroyed Eleian city of Dyspontion (no. 250 ) migrated to Epidamnos and Apollonia (Strabo 8 . 3 . 32 ; for the chronology: Ducat ( 1962 ) 175 -76 ). The city was strong and populous (Thuc. 1 . 24 . 3 ), but civil strife over many years ( στασιάσαντες ) and wars with the neighbouring indigenous towns left it weak. Internal strife led ultimately to the conflicts between Epidamnos,Korkyra and Corinth. C. 437 the demos expelled the aristocratic faction ( οιasper δυνατοί ), which then concluded an alliance with the neighbouring peoples and with Korkyra. In 435 Epidamnos sent envoys ( presbeis ) to Korkyra pleading mediation, but this was rejected (Thuc. 1 . 24 . 5 -7 ). Following the advice of Delphi, the Epidamnians gave up their colony to Corinth, a garrison of Corinthians was sent to the aid of Epidamnos,and the Epidamnians were reinforced by new colonists of Corinthians,Leukadians (no. 126 ) and Ambrakiots (no. 113 ) (Thuc. 1 . 25 ), who obtained equal rights with the other citizens (Thuc. 1 . 27 . 1 ). The result was a siege of the city by the Korkyraians and the exiled Epidamnians (Thuc. 1 . 26 . 5 ). The war between Corinth and Korkyra led to the defeat of the Corinthian fleet, the conquest of Epidamnos in 434 , and the reintroduction of an 'aristocratic' constitution (for the 'Kerkyraika' (Thuc. 1 . 24 -55 ), see Hornblower ( 1991 ) 66 -97 ; Salmon ( 1984 ) 282 -85 ; for the stasis , see Gehrke, Stasis 60 -62 ). There are few sources for the later history of Epidamnos and Apollonia (no. 77 ), but in the C4s Illyrian kings came to play a major part. Epidamnos was given over to Glaukias, king of the Illyrians, by the Korkyraians in 313 (Diod. 19 . 78 . 1 ), and Illyrian dynasts may have been in power before this if coin legends naming Monoun, basileos , are C4s and refer to the father of Glaukias, as argued by Ceka ( 1972 ) 25 -27 . The constitution was originally a narrow oligarchy which was changed piecemeal into a more moderate form of oligarchy (Arist. Pol . 1301 b 14 -15 ): the phylarchs were replaced by a council ( boule ); among the full citizens ( politeuma ) the magistrates were under obligation to attend the assembly ( heliaia ); and the single archon was another oligarchic element of the constitution (Arist. Pol . 1301 b 21 -25 ). After a stasis probably in 437 , the oligarchic constitution was changed into a democracy: the people ( demos ) exiled the members of the ruling class ( hoi dynatoi , Thuc. 1 . 24 . 5 ), and citizens hitherto excluded from the politeia were apparently enfranchised (Arist. Pol . 1304 a 13 -17 ). But in 433 the Epidamnian democrats had to surrender the city to the besieging Korkyraians on the following terms: the new colonists were sold into slavery, the Corinthian garrison was imprisoned (Thuc. 1 . 29 . 5 ), and the exiles were restored to Epidamnos (Diod. 12 . 30 . 5 ). As a result, the constitution was changed once again: one supreme official ( arche ) was in charge of the (financial) administration (Arist. Pol . 1287 a 4 -8 ), and another official, called poletes , was in charge of all trade between Epidamnos and its barbarian neighbours (Plut. Mor . 297 F).Artisans employed on public works were public slaves (Arist. Pol . 1267 b 16 -19 ). Epidamnos was situated in Illyris, in the territory of the Taulantioi, an Illyrian tribe ( ethnos , Thuc. 1 . 24 . 1 ), on the coast at modern Durrës in central Albania. The town was founded on an isthmus (Thuc. 1 . 26 ), according to some later sources the name of the peninsula was Dyrrhachion (Eratosthenes apud Steph. Byz. 244 . 10 -11 ; cf. Strabo 7 . 5 . 8 ), whereas according to App. B Civ . 2 . 39 Dyrrachion was the name of the harbour, Epidamnos the name of the upper city. According to Paus. 6 . 10 . 8 , there was a short distance between the two cities. However, there is no archaeological evidence for separate settlements. The few Greek remains lie beneath the Roman, mediaeval and modern city, but they confirm a foundation date of c. 625 (Hidri ( 1987 )); see also D'Andria ( 1990 ) 285 for noteworthy early Archaic finds and also now Davis, et al. ( 2003 ). There are architectural remains of two C6l sanctuaries situated on the outskirts of the modern city, but the location in relation to the ancient city is unknown (Korkuti ( 1994 ) 403 ). A fortification wall is implicitly attested for the 430 s by Thuc. 1 . 26 . 5 . A cult of Herakles is deduced from a C6 -C5 relief of Herakles with votive inscription ( I.Dyrrh . 1 ); a C4 -C3 inscription mentions Asklepios ( I.Dyrrh . 2 ); and a C4 -C3 inscription the theoi megaloi ( I.Dyrrh . 3 (restored)). Coins offer evidence of cults of Herakles and Zeus ( infra ). According to Paus. 6 . 19 . 8 , the Epidamnians dedicated a treasury at Olympia, now identified in foundation III of the Treasury Terrace. C6s roof fragments have been assigned to the building (Mallwitz ( 1972 ) 165 -71 ; Mertens-Horn and Viola ( 1990 ) 239 -40 ). Kleosthenes, son of Pontis, from Epidamnos, was victor in the chariot race at Olympia in 516 (Paus. 6 . 10 . 6 ; Olympionikai 141 ). The names of the months Haliotropios ( I.Magnesia 46 . 3 = Rigsby no. 96 ), Apellaios, Machaneus and Panamos ( I.Dyrrh . 580 , 582 -83 ) suggest a Corinthian origin for the calendar (Hadzis ( 1994 ): Trümpy, Monat . 161 ). Dyrrhachion struck coins ( 1 ) c. 450 -350 , staters with Korkyraian types: obv . cow suckling calf; rev . stellate squares; legend: ∆ΥΡ , or ∆ ( SNG Cop. Illyricum 421 -28 ); ( 2 ) c. 350 -229 , staters on the Corinthian standard and with Corinthian types: obv . Pegasos; rev . Athena, behind club; legend: ∆ΥΡΑΧΙΝΩΝ , ∆ΥΡ , ∆ ( SNG Cop. Illyricum 429 -32 ); ( 3 ) c. 300 -200 , drachms with Corinthian types: obv . head of Herakles; rev . Pegasos; legend as supra ( SNG Cop . 433 -42 ) (Ceka ( 1972 ) 22 , 57 -66 ).An otherwise unknown C4s Illyrian dynast, Monoun, struck tridrachms of Korkyraian type with the legend ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩ ΜΟΝΟΥΝΙΟΥ ∆ΥΡ (Ceka ( 1972 ) 23 -27 ; SNG Cop. Illyricum 528 ). ( 4 ) Bronze coins were struck from C4l: obv . head of Dodonaian Zeus; rev . tripod; legend: ∆ΥΡ , and magistrates' names ( SNG Cop. Illyricum 501 -23 ; Ceka ( 1972 ) dates to C4 ). Three silver staters ( obv . head of Athena, rev . Pegasos, legend: Ε or Ε and /Koppa ) struck in C5 and probably prior to the Peloponnesian War may represent the earliest coins of the city (using the name Epidamnos ) presumably struck in collaboration with Corinth (no. 227 ).

The city-ethnic is attested in the collective and internal sense on C4 coins: ΗΡΑΚΛΕΙΟΤΑΝ ( infra ). Herakleia is called a polis Hel in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 22 . Its status as a polis in the political sense is indicated by the C4mint ( infra ). Herakleia had a harbour ( limen , Ps.-Skylax 22 ), but its location has not been established satisfactorily. Its origin is unknown, though most scholars take it to be one of the Adriatic foundations of Dionysios I (see coin evidence below). Herakleia is usually located on the island of Pharos, where most of the coins have been found (Brun˘ smid ( 1898 ) 54 ; Dukat and Mirnik ( 1976 ) 181 -82 . For a recent suvey of coin distribution, see Kirigin ( 1990 ) 294 -95 ). Attempts to identify Herakleia with various sites in the eastern Adriatic, such as the Knidian foundation on Korkyra Melaina, are unconvincing (Braccesi ( 1977 ) 106 -8 ). Herakleia struck bronze coins in C4 on the Syracusan standard.Types:( 1 ) obv . Herakles; rev . bow and club; legend: ΗΡΑ or ΗΡΑΚ or ΗΡΑΚΛ or ΗΡΑΚΛΕ (Brun˘ smid ( 1898 ) 1 -15 ; SNG Cop .

81,Issa (Issaios),The Adriatic,43.05,16.05,993,5010,"81 . Issa (Issaios) Map 20 , island. Lat. 43 . 05 , long. 16 . 05 ; city not indicated on map.Size of territory: 3 . Type: A: α . The toponym /acuteΙσσα , ηasper is used about both the island and the city (Ps.-Skylax 23 ). At Diod. 15 . 13 . 4 , contra e.g. Stylianou ( 1998 ) 193 -95 , one should reject /acuteΙσσαν as a plausible emendation of MS Λισσόν or Λίσον . For the emendation of 15 . 14 . 2 , see infra . The city-ethnic is /acuteΙσσαιος ( Syll . ³ 141 . 2 (C4 -C3 )). Issa is called a πόλις ' Ελληνίς in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 23 . That Issa was a polis in the political sense too is indicated by its mint ( infra ) and the colonisation decree of c. 300 ( infra ). The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested in the colonisation decree ( Syll . ³ 141 . 2 ) and on C3 bronze coins ( infra ). According to Ps.-Skymnos 413 -14 , Issa was a Syracusan foundation ( apoikia ), and this tradition is confirmed by some of the names of the c. 250 Issaian colonists sent to Melaina Korkyra (no. 83 ) ( SEG 40511 , 43 348 ). Issa is normally believed to have been founded by Dionysios I in connection with his establishment of colonies in the Adriatic (Diod. 15 . 13 . 1 -5 (r 385 ); see esp. Braccesi ( 1977 ) 230 -32 ; Stylianou ( 1998 ) 196 ), although there is no unequivocal literary or archaeological evidence for this (cf. Beaumont ( 1936 ) 202 ; and see infra ), and archaeological evidence indicates a settlement of Greeks prior to Dionysios'interference (Sanader ( 2002 )), just as sporadic finds of Archaic Greek pottery from Issa and Pharos attest earlier contacts with the Greek world; also, the hero Ionios, though first attested on C4 coins from Issa ( infra ), may have had an earlier cult on the island of Issa (Braccesi ( 1977 ) 75 -76 , 229 n. 106 ). Issa served as a naval station when Dionysios' governor ( eparchos ) of Issa in 384 engaged in a naval battle against the Illyrians in support of the Knidian colony of Pharos (Diod. 15 . 14 . 2 , where /acute Ισσηsubiotaη is a plausible conjecture for MSS ΛισσΩsubiotaῶ or Λισσηsubiotaηtilde or Λίισηsubiotaη (Vial (Budé), followed by Fraser ( 1993 ) 169 and Stylianou ( 1998 ) 197 ; the emendation is rejected by Woodhead ( 1970 ) 508 n. 1 and Braccesi ( 1977 ) 227 -32 ; however, the distance makes it unlikely that Dionysios' ships came from Lissos). The presence of a Syracusan eparchos at Issa indicates that the colony was a dependent polis . The main source for the political organisation of Issa is a colonisation decree of c. 300 -250 ( Syll . ³ 141 = Staatsverträge 451 ), passed by the demos (l. 3 : έδοξε τΩsubiotaῶ δή µ Ωsubiotaω ). The eponymous official is a hieromnamon (l. 1 ), and the Issaians sent as colonists to Melaina Korkyra are divided into the three Doric tribes: Dymanes, Hylleis and Pamphyloi ( 18 ff). The decree was passed in the month of Machaneus ( 1 ), also attested in the Korkyraian calendar (Trümpy, Monat . 161 ). The decree was previously connected with Dionysios I's activities in the northern Adriatic and dated c. 385 ( Syll . ³ 141 ), but has later been downdated to c. 300 (Fraser ( 1993 ) 170 ff; C4 -C3 in LGPN 3 ) or C3f (Rendi´ c-Mio˘ cevi´ c ( 1965 ); Woodhead ( 1970 ) 508 -10 ; cf. SEG 43 348 ). Issa is situated at modern Vis on the north side of the island off the coast of ancient Dalmatia, on a slope on the west side of a large bay, one of the largest natural ports of Dalmatia. The immediate hinterland covers about 1 , 000 ha, but Issa probably controlled the entire island, a territory of about 140 km ² . Possible evidence for Greek land division is identified by Zaninovi´ c ( 2002 ). Greek finds go back to the Archaic period, though the nature of the finds is uncertain (Kirigin ( 1990 ) 303 , 310 ). There are few urban remains of the C4 Greek city. The C4 circuit wall, built in ashlar technique, may have had an Archaic predecessor (ibid. ( 1990 ) 303 ). The C4 wall enclosed an area of c. 9 . 8 ha. There are traces of a street grid and habitation structures (Zaninovi´ c ( 1976 a ); Kirigin ( 1990 ); Cambi ( 2002 ) 49 -55 ). The known cemetery is Heltic (Kirigin ( 1990 ) 303 ). The present archaeological record indicates that there was no Greek settlement before c. 330 (Kirigin ( 1990 ) 310 ; cf. Visonà ( 1995 ) 56 -57 ), but 'Only approximately 10 % of the city of Issa is said to have been explored thus far' (Visonà ( 1995 ) 57 n. 10 ), and the archaeological record is not necessarily incompatible with a foundation date in the reign of Dionysios I. Issa struck bronze coins from C4f (Gorini ( 1993 )) or C4s (Visonà ( 1995 ); Mandini ´ c and Visonà ( 2002 )): ( 1 ) according to Gorini ( 1993 ), overstrikes on Dionysian issues; according to Visonà ( 1995 ), rather c. 330 -320 transitional issues to Issa's civic issues. Types: obv . head of Ionios; rev . dolphin; legend: ΙΟΝΙΟ ( Σ ) ( SNG Cop. Illyricum 538 -39 ); ( 2 ) C3 , various types. Legend: ΙΣ , on some ΙΣΣΑ ( SNG Cop.

82,Lissos (Lissates),The Adriatic,41.45,19.35,430,2203,"82 . Lissos (Lissates) Map. 49 . Lat. 41 . 45 , long. 19 . 35 . Size of territory: ? Type: C: β . The toponym is Λίσσος , ηasper (Diod. 15 . 13 . 4 ; on 14 . 2 , see supra ; App. Ill . 21 ) or οasper (Polyb. 2 . 12 . 3 ). The collective and internal form of the city-ethnic is attested on C2 coins ( SNG Cop. Illyricum 524 : ΛΙΣΣΑΤΑΝ ). Lissos is called a polis in the urban sense by Diod. 15 . 13 . 4 (rC4e). Lissos was founded shortly before 385 by Dionysios I (Diod. 15 . 13 . 4 ; following Vial (Budé), Stylianou ( 1998 ) 194 defends the MS reading Λισσόν against the emendation /acuteΙσσαν , preferred by e.g. Beloch ( 1922 ) 118 n. 2 ). Lissos was founded on the steep slope of a hill, modern Lezha, on the south bank of the river Drin, near its estuary (anc. Drilo) (May ( 1946 ) 54 -56 ), a site already occupied by Illyrian settlers (Prendi and Zheku ( 1972 )). The site of Akrolissos, listed by Strabo 7 . 5 . 8 as a polis apart, is normally identified as the fortress lying above Lissos on the height of Mali Selbuemit, an interpretation indicated by Polyb. 8 . 13 . 1 , who describes this as a fortress separated from the city itself (for the topography of Lissos and Akrolissos, see Praschniker and Schober ( 1919 )). Extensive circuit walls are from different phases: a C4 phase comprised only an upper acropolis of c. 2 . 3 ha.Walls in ashlar blocks, strengthened with square towers, were raised down the slope of the hill to the river Drin in C3 -C2 ; with a perimeter of 2 , 150 m they enclosed a lower settlement area of c. 22 ha (Prendi and Zheku ( 1972 ); Fraser ( 1993 ) 169 n. 17 ). Diateichisma walls divided the city into zones, perhaps based upon different functions.The city had a harbour on the river bank (Koch ( 1989 ) 140 -43 ; Ceka ( 1990 ) 222 -23 fig. 11 ). The urban features are rather similar to those of local Illyrian sites, but the south-west gateway is very sophisticated and shows characteristics of Syracusan (Dionysian) C4military architecture. Although the archaeological remains, including the circuit wall, are now dated mainly to the Heltic period, it cannot be precluded that Lissos was a Dionysian foundation on a smaller scale (Stylianou ( 1998 ) 194 )."
83,Melaina  Korkyra (Korkyraios),The Adriatic,43.0,17.0,735,3728,"83 . Melaina Korkyra (Korkyraios) Map 20 . Lat. 43 . 00 , long. 17 . 00 . Size of territory: 4 ( c. 300 km ² ). Type: A: α . The toponym Μέλαινα Κόρκυρα , ηasper (Ps.-Skymnos 428 ; Strabo 7 . 5 . 5 .) is used for both the island and the city (Strabo 7 . 5 . 5 ). The city-ethnic Κορκυραῖος is attested on C3 coins ( infra ). The colony is referred to as a polis in the urban sense in the colonisation decree passed by the Issaians (no. 81 ; Syll . ³ 141 . 4 , 9 , 17 ) and in some late sources (Strabo 7 . 5 . 5 ; Plin. HN 3 . 152 : oppidum ). That it was a polis in the political sense too is indicated by the C3 coins ( infra ). According to Ps.-Skymnos 428 , Strabo 7 . 5 . 5 and Plin. HN 3 . 152 , Melaina Korkyra was a Knidian colony. But a C4 -C3 decree passed by the Issaians and found in modern Lumbarda (probably = ancient Melaina Korkyra) lays down regulations for an ab novo colonisation by Issaians ( Syll . ³ 141 ). Some historians assume that there were two colonies on the island, the first one founded by Knidians in perhaps C6 (Beaumont ( 1936 ) 174 )-unlocated, but perhaps situated at Vela Luka on the west coast-and the other founded by Issaians-situated at modern Lumbarda on the east coast-see (Braccesi ( 1977 ) 104 -6 ; Kirigin ( 1990 ) 293 ). A preferable reconstruction seems to be that the original Knidian settlement had died out before the new Issaian foundation, and that the Issaians were resettling a place already occupied in the past by the Greeks (Graham ( 1964 ) 43 ). Note,however,that Melaina Korkyra was still referred to as a Knidian colony in the Roman period. The foundation by Issaians is attested in the inscription found on Kor˘ cula (Korkyra Melaina) near modern Lumbarda ( Syll . ³ 141 ; SEG 17 312 , 19 435 , 40 511 , 43 348 = Lombardo ( 1993 ) passim with rich bibliography; Lombardo ( 2002 )) now dated to C3f (Woodhead ( 1970 ) 508 -9 following Rendi´ c-Miocevi´ c ( 1983 ) 192 ) or C4 -C3 (Fraser ( 1993 ) 170 ff and LGPN 3 ), see also Braccesi ( 1977 ) 311 -12 . The decree may have been a treaty between Issa and the otherwise unknown Illyrian dynasts Pyllos and Dazos, allowing the foundation of a colony on their territory ( Staatsverträge 451 ). Or Pyllos and Dazos, being either Issaians or Illyrians, were the oecists of the colony (Braccesi ( 1977 ) 310 ). The Issaian foundation may have been located at Lumbarda, where the inscription was found, in eastern Kor˘ cula; for archaeological remains and discussion of the colony's location, see Radi ´ c and Bass ( 2002 ). There are a few urban remains and a C3 cemetery in the vicinity (Braccesi ( 1977 ) 309 -16 ; Kirigin ( 1990 ) 311 ). On the walls ( Syll . ³ 141 . 4 -5 , 17 ), see Maier ( 1959 -61 ) 204 -6 . The settlers were Dorians, and the three Dorian tribes Hylleis, Dymanes and Pamphyloi are named in the inscription (l. 18 ). Onomastic studies indicate that the Issaian colonisers came originally from Syracuse (no. 47 ) (Fraser ( 1993 )), but there was an Illyrian element too (Woodhead ( 1970 ) 510 ). The inscription throws valuable light on the distribution of land in the city and in the chora of the colony (Asheri ( 1971 )). For possible traces of land division, see Zaninovi´ c ( 2002 ). A rare series of C4 bronze coins were struck by the Korkyraians of Melaina Korkyra, whether the Knidian foundation or the Issaian is not clear. Types: obv . Apollo; rev . ear of corn; legend: ΚΟΡΚΥΡΑΙΩΝ (Brun˘ smid ( 1898 ) 69 listing specimens, one with legend ΚΟΡΚΥ (Dukat and Mirnik ( 1976 ) 182 )). For the uncertain evidence of a C4 bronze coinage with obv . male head; rev . 'Knidian lion' , no legend and no attested provenance from Kor˘ cula-but attested from the island of Issa (Kirigin ( 1990 ) 293 )."
84,Pharos (Pharios),The Adriatic,43.15,16.35,746,3543,"84 . Pharos (Pharios) Map. 20 . Lat. 43 . 15 , long. 16 . 35 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: A: α . The toponym Φάρος , ηasper is used for both the island and the polis (Ps.-Skylax 23 ). Φάρος , οasper is attested only once (Polyb. 5 . 108 . 7 ). According to Strabo 7 . 5 . 5 , the toponym was originally Πάρος . The city-ethnic is Φάριος (C4 coins, infra ). Pharos is called a πόλις ' Ελληνίς in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 23 . The political sense is attested in a funerary epigram of C4 -C3 ( SEG 31 604 . 1 = CEG 662 ). The collective and internal use of the cityethnic is attested on the C4 coins ( infra ). For the individual and external use, see ∆η µ ήτριος οasper Φάριος (Polyb. 2 . 65 . 5 (r 222 )). Pharos was a colony ( apoikia ) founded by Paros (no. 509 ) in 385 with the assistance of Dionysios I of Syracuse according to Diod. 15 . 13 . 4 , 14 . 1 -2 , whereas only Paros is mentioned as the founder by Ephor. fr. 89 , by Ps.-Skymnos 426 -27 , and by Strabo 7 . 5 . 5 . Two decrees of C3l, one passed by the polis of Pharos, the other by the polis of Paros, refer to Pharos as a colony of Paros ( SEG 23 489 a 11 -16 , 29 -30 ; for the date: SEG 43349 ).Archaeological evidence suggests the possibility that the colony of 385 was preceded by 'pre-colonial' Greek settlement (Gaffney et al . ( 2002 )). Pharos, modern Stari Grad, lies innermost in a narrow bay on the north side of the island of Pharos (modern Hvar). The fertile hinterland (plain of Jelsa), c. 20 km ² , is cut off from the rest of the island by a mountain range; the easternmost part of the plain was retained under Illyrian control (Kirigin ( 1990 ) 296 fig. 3 , 301 -2 ). The chora shows traces of a land division, with 1 , 000 × 200 m lots,which may go back to the Greek period (cf. Heltic(?) horos stone: Brun˘ smid ( 1898 ) 20 . 5 ; Cambi ( 2002 ) 56 -57 ; Slap˘ sak ( 2002 )). The Greek settlers found the site occupied by Illyrians (preGreek defences: Kirigin ( 1990 ) 299 ; cf. Diod. 15 . 14 . 1 ), and an armed conflict between the Illyrians and the colonists was won by the colonists only because the Syracusan commander in, probably, Issa (no. 81 ) sent a squadron (Diod. 15 . 14 . 1 -2 ; see, Stylianou ( 1998 ) 193 -97 , and supra 332 ). There are few urban remains; the size of the Greek city is estimated to comprise between 1 . 5 ha and 6 ha (Kirigin ( 1990 ) 299 ; Cambi ( 2002 ) 56 -57 ). According to Diodorus, the Parian settlers fortified their city (Diod. 15 . 14 . 1 ), and there are traces of circuit walls in 'Cyclopean' and in masonry technique (Zaninovi´ c ( 1976 b ); Cambi ( 2002 ) 56 , 70 ); for remains of walls and for local pottery, see Jeli˘ ci˘ cRadoni´ c ( 2002 ) and Kirigin et al . ( 2002 ). Pharos struck a rich series of coins from C4 (Head, HN ² 318 ; Dukat and Mirnik ( 1976 ) 182 -83 ). Silver types: obv . Zeus; rev . goat or serpent; legend: ΦΑΡ or ΦΑΡΙ (Brun˘ smid ( 1898 ) 41 -46 ). Bronze, in four denominations: ( 1 ) Types as above. Legend: ΦΑ or ΦΑΡΙΩΝ ( SNG Cop. Illyricum 545 -46 ). ( 2 ) Types: obv . Persephone; rev . goat; legend: ΦΑ ( SNG Cop. Illyricum 547 -48 ). ( 3 ) Types: obv . Dionysos; rev . kantharos; legend: ΦΑ ( SNG Cop. Illyricum 549 -50 ). Coin finds reveal a wide commercial network from Makedonia to Sicily (Kirigin ( 1990 ) 301 ). A series of overstrikes carrying the legend ∆Ι or ∆ΙΜ have been attributed to an otherwise unknown polis of Dimos,but the type was most likely issued by a Pharian magistrate or ruler (Dukat and Mirnik ( 1976 ) 182 ; Rendi´ c-Mio˘ cvi´ c ( 1983 ) 193 )."
85,Spina (Spinites),The Adriatic,44.4,12.05,706,3701,"85 . Spina (Spinites) Map. 40 . Lat. 44 . 40 , long. 12 . 05 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: β . The toponym is Σπίνα , ηasper (Eudoxus fr. 358 , Lasserre; Strabo 5 . 1 . 7 ). No matter whether one accepts Müller's insertion of the toponym &lt; Σπίνα &gt; in Ps.-Skylax 17 , there can be little doubt that Spina must be the πόλις ' Ελληνίς referred to in the passage.The text is probably corrupt, but Spina is the only city which both topographically and historically fits the text as transmitted (Peretti ( 1979 ) 202 -16 ). Apart from a reconstructed form at Steph. Byz. 584 . 13 , the only attestation of the city-ethnic is Σπινιτῶν at Strabo 5 . 1 . 7 . According to Strabo 5 . 1 . 7 , Spina had dwindled to a small village but was once a famous Hellenic polis : ηasper Σπίνα , νυtildeν µ εgraveν κω µ ίον , πάλαι δεgrave ' Ελληνιgraveς πόλις ένδοξος . The archaeological record indicates that the period referred to is C6l-C4 ( infra ), and, combining the archaeological record with the almost universally accepted interpretation of Ps.-Skylax, Spina is therefore included in this Inventory as a polis . According to one tradition, Spina was a Greek colony (Strabo 5 . 1 . 7 ; Just. Epit . 20 . 1 . 11 ; Plin. HN 3 . 120 : founded by Diomedes), but Hellan. fr. 4 ( = Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 1 . 18 . 4 , 28 . 3 ) describes the town as a Pelasgian foundation. It was founded in Umbrian territory (Just. Epit . 20 . 1 . 11 ) or what was originally Umbrian territory before the C6Etruscan expansion (cf. Pareti ( 1961 ) 411 -12 ). By C4m the city fell victim to Celtic invasions (Peretti ( 1979 ) 201 -2 ). The settlement, c. 6 km west of present-day Comacchio (prov. Ferrara), was originally situated on the coast (Strabo 5 . 1 . 7 , though it lay further inland in his time) on the estuary of one of the tributaries of the river Po, viz . the river Spinos (Steph. Byz. 584 . 14 ). Aerial photographs have revealed an irregular perimeter and ramparts,a north-west/south-east street grid,with housing plots separated by channels and dykes, and excavations have laid bare the remains of timber houses. The habitation area extended over c. 6 ha and was linked to the sea by a 15 mwide canal, probably built by Etruscan engineers (Uggeri and Uggeri Patitucci ( 1974 ); for the urbanisation in an Etruscan setting, see Gulletta ( 1994 ) 256 n. 43 ). The city is Etruscan, but it is profoundly Heled with its Greek 'merchant-houses' , etc., involved in the dispersal of Greek goods. Greek presence is attested by the finds of Greek graffiti from the site (Colonna ( 1974 )); cf. the vast quantity of Attic C6l-C4 vases from the Valle Trebba cemetery (see infra ). The evidence indicates a substantial Greek presence at Spina. Two sectors of the cemetery have been laid bare, one with c. 1 , 413 tombs, another with c. 2 , 650 tombs. The grave goods, primarily vases destined for use in banquets, reflect wide commercial C6 -C3 contacts with Greece-mainly Athens (no. 361 ), with rich finds of Attic red-figure vases covering the period 480 -375 (Alfieri ( 1979 ), ( 1994 ); Berti and Guzzo ( 1993 )). The contacts with the Greek world were sealed by a treasury at Delphi (see infra ). A cult of Apollo at Spina can be deduced from the Spinetan treasury at Delphi, and graffiti attest cults of Dionysos and Hermes at S. Maria della Tomba, and votive busts a cult of Demeter ( IGDGG no. 77 b, c; Gulletta ( 1994 ) 258 ; Mambella ( 1984 )). According to Strabo 5 . 1 . 7 , the city had a treasury at Delphi, not archaeologically identified (for attempts, cf.Alfieri ( 1979 ) xlvii n. 28 ). The description of the contents of the treasury indicates some wealth (Polemon apud Ath. 13 . 606 A). ## II. The Poleis"
86,Amantia (Amantieus),Epeiros,40.25,19.45,287,1416,"86 . Amantia (Amantieus) Map 49 . Lat. 40 . 25 , long. 19 . 45 . Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is Α µ αντία , ηasper (Ps.Skylax 26 ; Lycoph. Alex . 1043 ) or Αβαντία (C3l/C2e Delphic list of theorodokoi : Plassart ( 1921 ) col. iv 56 ). The city-ethnic is Α µ αντιευacuteς (Ps.-Skylax 27 ). Amantia is attested as a polis in the urban sense in Lycoph. Alex . 1043 ( εις Α µ αντίαν πόλιν ). Also, Ps.-Skylax indicates that Amantia was of some importance by listing it as the only site between the two poleis of Apollonia (no. 77 ) and Orikos (no. 103 ) (Ps.-Skylax 26 , where Α µ αντία seems to denote the territory rather than the urban centre of the polis ; cf. Steph. Byz. 82 . 23 : Α µ αντία ' Ιλλυρίων µ οῖρα ). Apart from the collective and external use of the city-ethnic found in Ps.-Skylax, the only attestation in Greek sources of the city-ethnic is in Steph. Byz. 83 . 1 . Cults of Aphrodite (Ceka ( 1990 ) 218 ) and Athena (Tzouvara-Souli ( 1979 ) fig. 1 ) are attested; they are probably of Heltic date. Amantia is identified with the ancient remains near Plocë (Corvisier ( 1991 ) 288 ); it was fortified in C5 ; the walls were about 2 , 100 m long and enclosed an area of roughly 20 ha.A temple and a stadium have been found south of the walls (Ceka ( 1990 ) 217 -18 ). Ceka ( 1990 ) 217 suggests that Amantia replaced Thronion (cf. 328 ), which was destroyed by Apollonia (no. 77 ) in C5m."

The only thing we know about Artichia is that in, probably, 355 a theorodokos was appointed to host theoroi from Epidauros: Αρτιχία . Σχιδαtildeς ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 30 ), cf. Perlman ( 2000 ) 278 . Cabanes ( 1997 a ) suggests locating Artichia in the Parauaia in the Permet basin."
88,Batiai,Epeiros,39.15,20.5,360,1897,"88 . Batiai Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 15 , long. 20 . 50 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type:A.The toponym is Βιτία , ηasper (Theopomp.fr. 206 ) or Βατίαι , αιasper (Theopomp.fr. 382 apud Strabo 7 . 7 . 5 ). The earliest evidence of Batiai as a polis is Theopomp. fr. 206 , where Batiai is mentioned together with Elateia (no. 94 ), Pandosia (no. 104 ) and Boucheta (no. 90 ) as πόλεις τῶν Κασσωπαίων . Since these three sites are mentioned by Dem. 7 . 32 as being colonies of Elis (no. 251 ), it seems reasonable to suppose that Batiai too was an Elean colony. Batiai was a polis belonging to the Kassopians (Theopomp.fr. 206 ), who in turn formed a section of the Thesprotians (Strabo 7 . 7 . 5 ). In C4s Batiai was a dependency of Kassopa (no. 100 ). Batiai is identified with the ruins of the Kastri hill 3 km south of Rizovouni (Podogora), 3 . 5 km east of the modern village of Thesprotiko (plain of Lelovo), an advantageous position controlling the plain and the main route to central Epeiros (Dakaris ( 1971 b ) 183 ). The construction of a polygonal wall around the hill makes good use of the natural formation of the ground.Its construction is dated to the period after 343 / 2 . It was 1 , 400 m in circumference and enclosed an area of 10 . 1 ha (ibid. 185 ). The principal northern side (main entrance) was protected by large towers. Four other gates have been identified in the north-east, south, south-west and north-west corners (ibid. 186 figs. 45 -46 ). Traces of a polygonal wall are also visible inside the town,indicating the existence of a walled acropolis (ibid.). In the northern part of the acropolis is preserved a wall, which may have enclosed a shrine or a temenos (ibid.). Four cisterns have been found with a total capacity of about 300 -400 m ³ (ibid.). Dakaris ( 1971 b ) 87 states that it is impossible to determine the specific functions of the buildings inside the town."
89,[Berenike],Epeiros,39.02,20.45,123,594,"89 . [Berenike] Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 02 , long. 20 . 45 . Size of territory: ? Type: C. Berenike was a polis founded by Pyrrhos II in C3s (Steph. Byz. 164 . 3 : App. Mithr . 4 ). The town was situated at modern Michalitsi (Dakaris ( 1971 b ) fig. 30 , pace Barr .). The place, however, was fortified already in C4s (Dakaris ( 1971 b ) fig. 30 ). Dakaris ( 1971 b ) 51 supposes that Berenike was a seaport of Kassopa (no. 100 ) in addition to the one at modern Kastrosykia. Therefore the precursor of Berenike can perhaps be recognised as a dependent polis from C4s, viz . a dependency of Kassopa."
90,Boucheta (Bouchetios),Epeiros,39.1,20.5,444,2217,"90 . Boucheta (Bouchetios) Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 10 , long. 20 . 50 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Βουacuteχετα , τά (Dem. 7 . 32 ; Theopomp.fr. 206 ) or Βουχέτιον , τό (Theopomp. fr. 382 ; Strabo 7 . 7 . 5 ) or Βουacuteχετον , τό (Polyb. 21 . 26 . 8 ). The city-ethnic is Βουχέτιος ( IG ix² . 1 512 (C3 )). Boucheta is classified as a polis in the urban sense by Dem. 7 . 32 and by Theopomp.fr. 206 . It is also regarded as a colony of Elis (no. 251 ) (Dem. 7 . 32 ). The individual use of the cityethnic is attested externally in a C3sepulchral inscription found in Palairos (no. 131 ) ( IG ix² . 1 512 ). Boucheta was a polis belonging to the Kassopians (Theopomp. fr. 206 ), who in turn formed a section of the Thesprotians (Strabo 7 . 7 . 5 ). In C4s Boucheta was a dependency of Kassopa (no. 100 ). According to tradition, Boucheta was situated in the Kassopaia at the river Louros at a short distance from the sea. Dakaris ( 1971 b ) 177 fig. 9 and Hammond ( 1976 a ) locate it on a secluded hill, where ruins of the Byzantine castle of Rogoi are visible, on the right bank of the river Louros. This was an advantageous position near the Ambrakian Gulf, to which Boucheta was connected by the navigable Louros. Dakaris ( 1971 b ) 178 suggests that Boucheta was the port of Elateia (no. 94 ) and Batiai (no. 88 ). The site was settled from prehistoric times. Corvisier ( 1991 ) 201 suggests that, already in the Archaic period, 0 . 75 ha was fortified. By C5l an isodomic wall with eight towers had been built and enclosed an area of 1 . 5 ha. The only gate was in the north-west corner (Dakaris ( 1971 b ) 181 fig. 47 ). When in C4f the settlement extended westward, the wall with interval towers was increased and now enclosed up to 3 . 5 ha, with a population of about 1 , 000 . The gateway was situated on the western side (ibid.). The visible remains of the urban structure have been destroyed by building activity in mediaeval and modern times; the only traces are of a large ancient building on the southern foothill which can be followed for about 80 m; it might be a stoa-shaped structure which probably served as a wharf or shipyard of the navigable river (ibid. 182 -83 fig. 47 )."
91,Bouthroton (Bouthrotios),Epeiros,39.45,20.0,284,1449,"91 . Bouthroton (Bouthrotios) Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 45 , long. 20 . 00 . Size of territory: ? Type: A. The toponym is Βουθρωτός (Hecat. fr. 106 = Steph. Byz. 709 . 16 -18 ) or Βουθρωτόν (Strabo 7 . 7 . 5 ). The individual use of the city-ethnic Βουθρώτιος is attested internally in a C3m dedication ( SEG 36 567 ). Bouthroton is attested as a polis in the urban sense at Hecat.fr. 106 ; it is unlikely that there was a polis in Epeiros as early as 500 , unless it was a Greek colony (Hansen ( 1997 ) 20 ). There is no tradition of a Greek colony,but excavations have yielded Protocorinthian,Corinthian and Attic pottery of C7 to C5 . It is perfectly possible that there was a Greek colony unattested but for the quote from Hekataios (Hammond ( 1967 ) 474 ; Hansen ( 1997 ) 20 ). Bouthroton was situated about 6 km from modern Saranda. Ptol. Geog . 3 . 14 . 4 lists Bouthroton as part of Thesprotia. Bouthroton was the urban centre of the Prasaiboi, as is demonstrated by several Heltic proxeny decrees and manumission inscriptions found in Bouthroton ( SEG 32 622 -25 , 36 561 -68 , 38 470 -519 ). The acropolis was protected by three circuit walls. The oldest wall was constructed between C6 and C5 . Further fortified extensions are dated from C5 -C4 and C3 (Bergemann ( 1998 ) 50 ). The walls surrounded 3 . 7 ha (Corvisier ( 1991 ) 287 ). A C4stoa and a C4l theatre on the south slopes of the acropolis have been excavated (Bergemann ( 1998 ) 50 )."
92,Byllis (Byllion),Epeiros,40.35,19.45,403,1937,"92 . Byllis (Byllion) Map 49 . Lat. 40 . 35 , long. 19 . 45 . Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is Βυacuteλλις , ηasper ( SEG 38 542 (C3 -C2 ); Plut. Brut . 26 . 4 ) or Βουλλίς (Ptol. Geog . 3 . 13 . 4 ). The city-ethnic is Βυλλίων ( SEG 43 334 (oracular lead tablet of C4m); SEG 24 449 . 1 (C3s); Heltic coins (Head, HN ² 314 -15 )) or Βουλινός (Ps.-Skylax 27 ). The only attestation of Byllis as a polis is in Steph. Byz. 190 . 12 ( πόλις ' Ιλλυρίδος ). The collective use of the cityethnic is attested externally in a C4m oracle inquiry ( SEG 43 334 ) and internally by C3 -C2 coins (Head, HN ² 314 -15 ). The territory of the Bylliones is quite well identified by Ceka ( 1987 ) 135 -36 . He describes a trapezoidal territory on the right side of the rivers Luftinje and Aoos, extending in the west to the Malakastra mountains, in the south-west to Kalivac, and in the south-east to Rabie. This territory corresponds quite well with the tradition (Strabo 7 . 5 . 8 ; Ptol. Geog . 3 . 13 . 4 ). Byllis was part of the Atintania (Ceka ( 1987 ) 141 , map). Ptol. Geog . 3 . 13 . 4 mentions Byllis under the heading ' Ελυ µ ιωτῶν . Byllis was the urban centre of the κοινοgraveν Βυλλιόνων which is attested in C3s ( SEG 24 449 ). Ceka ( 1987 ) 137 traces the origin of the koinon back to C4m. The Bylliones acted for the first time as a political unit c. C4m, when they posed an oracle inquiry to Dodone (Dakaris et al . ( 1993 ) 56 ). The town of Byllis was situated at the right side of the Aoos, at modern Gradisht. It was fortified in C4m (Ceka ( 1990 ) 221 ). The wall enclosed an area of 28 ha (Corvisier ( 1991 ) 288 ). The archaeological remains confirm that Byllis was a political and cultural centre of the region in the Heltic period. Excavations have brought to light an agora, two stoas (C3s), a C3m theatre for c. 7 , 500 spectators, a stadium (C3s), a cistern and a peristyle temple of C3s (Ceka ( 1990 ) 224 -29 )."
93,Dodone (Dodonaios),Epeiros,39.3,20.45,491,2508,"93 . Dodone (Dodonaios) Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 30 , long. 20 . 45 . Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is ∆ωδώη , ηasper (Aesch. PV 658 ; Hdt. 1 . 46 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is ∆ωδωναῖος , and the external use is attested both collectively (Hdt. 2 . 57 . 1 ) and individually ( SGDI 1351 (C4s), 1355 (undated)). Usually Dodone is mentioned as an oracle (Hdt. 2 . 52 ) or a sanctuary (Eur. Phoen . 983 ). Dodone was the religious, political and cultural centre of the Molossian League and later of the Epirote League. Copies of the decrees (proxeny and citizenship decrees, manumission records) of the Molossian and Epirote League were set up in Dodone (the oldest decrees: Cabanes ( 1976 ) 534 -40 no. 1 ( 370 -368 ), no. 2 (shortly before 330 ), no. 3 (before 330 )). From these inscriptions we know of the main institutions and the most important magistrates of the Molossian and Epeirote League; but we have no information about the institutions of the city itself. For the Molossian League are attested basileus , prostates , grammateus , damiorgoi , synarchontes , hieromnemones (Cabanes ( 1976 ) 534 -40 nos. 1 -3 ) and an eklesia ( sic ) (ibid. 541 no. 5 ). Attested cults include Zeus Dodonaios or Naios (Hom. Il . 16 . 233 ; Cabanes ( 1976 ) 550 no. 24 (C5 ); Dem. 18 . 253 ); Dione (Cabanes ( 1976 ) 550 no. 24 (C5 )); Themis (ibid. 560 no. 22 (C4 )); Apollo (ibid. 560 no. 22 (C4 )); Aphrodite and Herakles (Dakaris ( 1993 a ) 19 -20 ). Dodone is situated 22 km south-west of modern Ioannina at the foot of Mt. Tomaros (Dakaris ( 1993 a ) 6 ). The acropolis was surrounded by a C4 polygonal wall which enclosed an area of 3 . 4 ha (Dakaris ( 1971 a ) 72 -73 ). It had ten towers, two main gates (in the north-east and south-west) and a small gate in the south (Dakaris ( 1993 a ) 34 -35 ). On the acropolis some foundations of buildings and a rectangular cistern hewn out of the rock are noticeable, but not yet completely excavated (Dakaris ( 1971 a ) 75 ). The main sanctuary was situated below the acropolis.The central cult site was the prophetic oak. In C5l the first temple was built, simple in construction with pronaos and cella (Evangelidis and Dakaris ( 1959 ) 27 ; Dakaris ( 1960 ) 6 ; Dieterle ( 1999 ) ch. iii. 1 ). The Molossian and Epeirote federal coins had among other types the head of Zeus Dodonaios and Dione, eagle, thunderbolt or oak leaves, all referring to the oracle at Dodone. Legend: ΜΟΛΟΣΣΟΝ or ΑΠΕΙΡΩΤΑΝ (Franke ( 1961 ) 93 -97 , 150 -56 ; SNG Cop. Epirus 105 -34 )."
94,Elateia,Epeiros,39.1,20.4,384,1884,"94 . Elateia Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 10 , long. 20 . 40 . Size of territory: ? Type:A.The toponym is ' Ελάτεια , ηasper (Dem. 7 . 32 ; Steph. Byz. 264 . 3 ), ' Ελάτρεια (Theopomp. fr. 206 ) and ' Ελάτρια (Strabo 7 . 7 . 5 ; Steph. Byz. 264 . 5 ). The only attestation of a city-ethnic is in Steph. Byz. 264 . 4 -5 . Elateia is classified as a polis in the urban sense by Dem. 7 . 32 and by Theopomp. fr. 206 . It is also regarded as being a colony of Elis (no. 251 ) (Dem. 7 . 32 ). Elateia was a polis belonging to the Kassopians (Theopomp. fr. 206 ), who in turn formed a part of the Thesprotians (Strabo 7 . 7 . 5 ). In C4s Elateia was a dependency of Kassopa (no. 100 ). Elateia controlled the plain east of the river Louros and also the northern highland region (Dakaris ( 1971 b ) 173 ). The location of Elateia has been much in dispute (cf. Dakaris ( 1971 b ) n. 456 ). Hammond ( 1967 ) 477 -78 and Dakaris ( 1971 b ) 171 locate it convincingly at the foot of Mt. Zalongo north of the village Paliorophoro. This site was settled from prehistoric times. Probably colonists established themselves on the north side of the hill, where the most ancient remains of buildings have been found (Dakaris ( 1971 b ) 172 ). Dakaris (ibid.) 172 suggests that in C5l the settlement was fortified with a polygonal wall of 1 , 690 m in circumference, which enclosed an area of 12 . 7 ha corresponding to a population of about 3 , 800 . The main gate was in the south-east leading to the Louros plain and Boucheta (no. 90 ), a second gate was in the south, a third in the east, and a fourth in the north (ibid. 174 ). There were at least two cemeteries outside the main section of the walled town (ibid. 176 ). The uneven nature of the terrain necessitated the construction of terraces and the building of tiered streets.There are no signs of grid planning of the town (ibid. 175 figs. 43 and 44 )."
95,Elea (Eleaios),Epeiros,39.25,20.35,468,2291,"95 . Elea (Eleaios) Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 25 , long. 20 . 35 . Size of territory: ? Type: B.The toponym is ' Ελέα , ηasper ( BCH 80 ( 1956 ) 300 (C4l-C3m)) or * Ελεία (Franke ( 1961 ) 300 -7 , arguing that MS ' Ελεδ in Ps.-Skylax 30 should be emended ' Ελεία or ' Ελέα instead of ' Ελαία , as the coins carry the legend ΕΛΕΑΤΑΝ or ΕΛΕΑΙ ( ΩΝ ); according to Franke ( 1961 ) 300 , the toponym ' Ελαία -derived from Thuc. 1 . 46 . 4 ( εν τηsubiotaηtilde ' Ελαιάτιδι ) and Ptol. Geog . 3 . 14 . 5 ( ' Ελαίας λι µ ήν )-is erroneous, and the passages should be emended ' Ελεάτιδι and ' Ελείας respectively. The city-ethnic is ' Ελεαῖος ( SGDI 1351 (C4s); coinage: Franke ( 1961 ) 43 ) and later ' Ελεάτας (coinage: Franke ( 1961 ) 44 -45 ). According to Ps.-Skylax 30 , Elea was just a harbour ( λι µ ήν ), but the archaeological, numismatic and epigraphical record reveals that in C4s Elea must have been a polis . Franke ( 1961 ) 301 -2 suggests that Elea was a colony of Corinth (no. 227 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C4s coins ( infra ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in a C4s manumission inscription from Dodone (no. 93 ) which records the name of a witness from Elea ( SGDI 1351 ). Elea was situated in the region of Elaiatis which, in turn, was part of the region of Thesprotia (Thuc. 1 . 46 . 4 ; Ps.Skylax 30 ). This is confirmed by a C4s manumission inscription from Dodona recording an ' Ελεαῖος among the Thesprotian witnesses ( SGDI 1351 ). Dakaris ( 1972 ) 97 identifies Elea with Charauge (near modernVeliani) on the slopes of the Korila and describes it as a fortified settlement of 10 ha (Dakaris ( 1987 ) 75 ). Gates are visible in the south-western and eastern part (Dakaris ( 1972 ) figs. 42 and 43 ). The city was grid-planned and had an agora (Dakaris ( 1971 b ) 184 ), a Heltic theatre comparable in size to the small theatre of Kassopa (no. 100 ), and two stoas to the west and east of the theatre (Dakaris ( 1971 b ) 178 , ( 1972 ) figs. 42 and 43 ), probably of the Heltic period. For a short period between c. 360 and 335 Elea struck bronze coins: obv . head of Persephone facing, or Pegasos; rev . Kerberos, or trident; legend: ΕΛΕΑΤΑΝ or ΕΛΕΑΙ ( ΩΝ ) (Franke ( 1961 ) 40 -41 ; SNG Cop. Epirus 49 -50 )."
96,Ephyra (Ephyros),Epeiros,39.15,20.3,317,1585,"96 . Ephyra (Ephyros) Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 15 , long. 20 . 30 . Size of territory: ? Type: A. The toponym is ' Εφυacuteρα , ηasper (Strabo 7 . 7 . 5 ) or ' Εφυacuteρη (Thuc. 1 . 46 . 4 ), later Κίχυρος (Strabo 7 . 7 . 5 ; Paus. 1 . 17 . 4 ). Dakaris ( 1972 ) 29 suggests that the site was renamed after 343 / 2 . The city-ethnic is /acuteΕφυρος (Paus. 9 . 36 . 3 ). Ephyra is called a polis in the urban sense by Thucydides in a passage where he explicitly distinguishes between the polis Ephyra and its harbour Cheimerion ( 1 . 46 . 4 ). Like Elea, Ephyra was situated in the region of Elaiatis, which in turn was part of the region of Thesprotia (Thuc. 1 . 46 . 4 ). Thucydides' description of Ephyra as lying inland and above the harbour has led to the identification of Ephyra with the ancient settlement at Xylokastro near modern Likouresi, 800 m north of the junction of the river Kokkytos with the Acheron. This site was inhabited from the prehistoric period and was already in LH III a fully developed settlement with a fortified acropolis enclosing an area of 4 . 24 ha (Dakaris ( 1972 ) 80 fig. 40 ); the settlement was the same size in C4 (ibid. 115 ). A gate has been found in the southern part (ibid. fig. 40 ). The identification of the ancient remains on the opposite hill (Dakaris ( 1993 b )) with the Nekromanteion mentioned in Hdt. 5 . 92 γ is now untenable in the light of Baatz ( 1999 ), who shows that the excavated building was an aristocratic residence erected between C4l and C3l, whereas the Nekromanteion must have been situated at the foot of the hill instead."
97,Eurymenai (Eurymenaios),Epeiros,39.4,20.55,245,1219,"97 . Eurymenai (Eurymenaios) Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 40 , long. 20 . 55 . Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is Ευρυ µ εναί , αιasper (Diod. 19 . 88 . 4 : εις ' Ευρυ µ εναgraveς πόλιν ' Ηπειρωτικήν (rC4l)). The city-ethnic is ' Ευρυ µ εναῖος ( SEG 15 384 ( 370 -368 )). Eurymenai is called a polis in the urban sense by Diod. 19 . 88 . 4 , reporting the siege, conquest and destruction of the polis in 312 . The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in two C4f Molossian citizenship decrees ( SEG 15 384 . 11 , 28 ) in which a citizen of Eurymenai occurs as damiorgos : δα µ ιοργῶν Ανδροκάδεος Αρκταtildeνος Ευρυ µ εναίων . In C4f Eurymenai was a member of the Molossian Koinon and belonged to the tribe of the Arktanoi (ibid.). Eurymenai is identified with the ancient remains of modern Kastritsa, which is situated on the south side of the lake of Ioannina (Hammond ( 1997 ) 31 ); the site, however, is identified with Tekmon (no. 109 ) by Cabanes ( 1997 b ) 116 . The site was settled from the prehistoric period (Dakaris ( 1951 ), ( 1952 )). In C4 the settlement on the hill was fortified. The area enclosed by the circuit measures c. 34 . 4 ha (Corvisier ( 1991 ) 214 ; Vokotopoulou ( 1970 ))."
98,Gitana,Epeiros,39.35,20.15,348,1792,"98 . Gitana Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 35 , long. 20 . 15 . Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is Γίτανα , τά (Polyb. 27 . 16 . 5 ). In the MSS the toponym is either Γίτωνα (P) or Γείτανα (Va) and Γίτανα is an emendation based on Gitana at Livy 42 . 38 . 1 . Dakaris ( 1972 ) 36 suggests that Γίτανα is probably a corruption of Τίτανα or Τιτάνη , derived from the word τίτανος , 'gyps' , which suits the location of the the site. For seal impressions inscribed with the toponym, see PrekaAlexandri ( 1996 ) 197 -98 . Livy 42 . 38 . 1 calls Gitana a meeting place of the Epeirote League ( concilio Epirotarum ). A C4m manumission inscription naming the eponymous prostates of the Thesprotians testifies to the importance of this town already in the Classical period and shows that Gitana belonged to the Thesprotian tribal community ( SEG 26 717 ). According to the C4m manumission inscription, Themis was worshipped in Gitana ( SEG 26 717 ); Tzouvara-Souli ( 1979 ) appendix fig. 1 mentions a cult of Aphrodite but does not suggest any date. Gitana is situated near Philiates on the north-west side of the limestone mountain Brysella at the confluence of the Kalpakiotikos and Kalamas, which was navigable up to this point (Dakaris ( 1972 ) 35 ). According to Polyb. 27 . 16 . 4 -6 , Gitana was situated c. 16 km from the sea. In C4 an area of 28 ha was enclosed with a circuit wall running for 3 , 000 m (Dakaris ( 1972 ) 115 ), and the town was grid-planned. The agora has been identified in the western part, and a small theatre has been discovered outside the wall (undated, but presumably C3 -C2 ). The main gate was in the northern side, and further gates were situated to the north-west,west and between the lower town and the acropolis (Dakaris ( 1987 ) 75 and ( 1972 ) figs. 53 -54 )."
99,Horraon (Horraitas),Epeiros,39.15,20.55,284,1374,"99 . Horraon (Horraitas) Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 15 , long. 20 . 55 . Size of territory: ? Type: B/C. The toponym is /asperacuteΟρραον , τό ( SEG 35 665 A. 18 (C2m)). The city-ethnic is ' Ορραίτας (Cabanes ( 1976 ) 586 no. 70 . 5 ) or ' Ορραείτας ( SEG 35 665 (C2m)) or /asperΟρ ( ρ ) είτας ( GGM I 239 . 45 = Dikaiarchos(?); cf. BCH 109 ( 1985 ) 522 -23 ). The rough breathing is attested in the Latin form Horreum (Livy 45 . 26 . 4 ). Horraon is not explicitly classified as a polis in any source; but in a decree of c. 330 , a citizen of Horraon is recorded among the hieromnemones of the Molossian koinon (Cabanes ( 1976 ) 539 -40 no. 3 ; cf. BCH 109 ( 1985 ) 522 ). It follows that Horraon was a member of the koinon and probably a polis in the political sense. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in a C2m treaty ( SEG 35 665 A. 24 ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in a C4manumission document (Cabanes ( 1976 ) 586 no. 70 ). Horraon has been identified by Cabanes and Andreou ( 1985 ) 520 with the ancient remains near Ammotopos. Excavations show that Horraon was fortified before C4m ( AR ( 1976 -77 ) 43 ). The enclosed area measures c. 7 . 2 ha (Corvisier ( 1991 ) 284 ). The city was grid-planned, and some houses of C4m-s have been excavated (Dakaris ( 1989 ) 42 -44 ; Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 147 -50 )."
100,Kassopa (Kassopaios),Epeiros,39.1,20.4,803,3964,"100 . Kassopa (Kassopaios) Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 10 , long. 20 . 40 . Size of territory: 5 ( c. 900 km ² : Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 120 ). Type: A. The toponym is Κασσώπα ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 25 ( 355 ); BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 51 (C3l)), in koine Κασσώπη , ηasper ( SEG 36 555 (C2s); Steph. Byz. 365 . 21 ) or Κασσωπία (Diod. 19 . 88 . 3 (rC4l)). The city-ethnic is Κασσωπαῖος (C4 coins ( infra ); I.Magnesia 32 . 51 (C2e); IG vii 188 . 11 (C2e)) or Κασσωπός (Herodoros ( FGrHist 31 ) fr. 35 ; Ps.-Skylax 31 ). The earliest source classifying Kassopa explicitly as a polis in the political sense is a C4l/C3e dedication on a statue base ( SEG 34 589 ). The evidence for Kassopa as a polis in the urban sense is literary and retrospective (Diod. 19 . 88 . 3 : Κασσωπίαν πόλιν (rC4l)). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in IG vii 188 . 11 ( = Ager ( 1996 ) no. 85 ) and internally on the C4 coins (Franke ( 1961 ) 69 -70 ) and on weights stamped with the inscription Κα [ σσωπαίων ] ( SEG 35 673 ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in IG ix² . 1 243 . 4 (C3 )). Kassopa was situated in a region called Κασσωπία (Dem. 7 . 32 ; Theopomp frr. 206 -7 ; Ps.-Skylax 31 -32 ) or Κασσιοπαία (Plut. Mor . 297 B) or Κασσιόπη (Ptol. Geog . 3 . 14 . 8 ), which was part of Thesprotia (Strabo 7 . 7 . 5 ). In most cases it is impossible to determine whether the evidence concerns the polis Kassopa or the region Kassopia.The territory was delimited by the river Acheron, the Ionian Sea and the Gulf of Ambrakia, and must have been c. 900 km ² in size (Thuc. 1 . 46 . 4 ; Ps.-Skylax 31 ; Ps.-Skymnos 447 , 453 , and Strabo 7 . 7 . 1 , 5 ). To Kassopaia belonged in C4four smaller towns of 5 to 8 ha (Batiai (no. 88 ), Berenike (no. 89 ), Boucheta (no. 90 ), and Kastrosykia (probably = Κασσιόπη λι µ ήν , mentioned in Ptol. Geog . 3 . 14 . 2 ; Strabo 7 . 7 . 4 )), one medium-sized town (Elateia (no. 94 )) and two large towns (Pandosia (no. 104 ) and Kassopa (Corvisier ( 1991 ) 87 ; see also the map in Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 116 )). According to Strabo 7 . 7 . 5 , the Kassopaians were Thesprotians, and c. 330 -325 they became members of the Epeirote Federation (Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 116 ). From C4m Kassopa was the political centre of the region and is recorded in the C4m list of theorodokoi from Epidauros ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 25 ). The attested political institutions are all of the Heltic period ( SEG 15 383 (C2 )). A C3 -C2 honorific decree passed by the πόλις Κασσωπαίων ( SEG 35 671 ) suggests that there was a popular assembly. The archaeological evidence ( infra ) indicates that these institutions existed already in C4 (Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 119 ). Kassopa is identified with the remains of an ancient settlement near modern Kamarina. Situated on the slopes of Mt. Zalongo, Kassopa had a dominating position with a superb view of the Gulf of Ambrakia. The C4m defence circuit enclosed an area of 30 ha (Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 123 ). The agora is situated south of the main road, in the westernmost part of the town. The place was probably chosen because of its magnificent view. The town was gridplanned, and the west side of the agora was probably from the beginning reserved for public buildings.The open ekklesiasterion of C3l (Hansen and Fischer-Hansen ( 1994 ) 62 -63 ) most likely had a predecessor in the form of a natural theatre. A temple of Aphrodite was built about C4m (Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 120 -45 figs. 94 and 95 ). The main deity of the town seems to have been Aphrodite (coins ( infra ), temple, SEG 15 383 (C2 )). A C4 -C3 theatre is located in the western part of the city ( TGR ii. 231 ). The Kassopaians struck silver and bronze coins in the period 342 -330 / 25 : obv . head of Aphrodite wearing stephanos or boucranion; rev . serpent or dove; legend (sometimes on obv .): ΚΑΣΣΩΠΑΙΩΝ (Franke ( 1961 ) 69 -75 ; SNG Cop. Epirus 43 -45 )."

The only attestation of the city-ethnic is in Steph. Byz. 475 . 2 . Nikaia is called polis only by Steph. Byz. 474 . 20 ( πόλις εν ' Ιλλυρίδι ). It has been included in this inventory because of the remains of a fortified C5 -C4settlement which is too large to be a kome ( infra ), combined with the site-classification in Steph. Byz. Nikaia was a member of the koinon of the Bylliones, as is apparent from a C2l inscription which mentions a Σώστρατος . . . Βυλλίων αποgrave Νικαίας (Leonardou ( 1925 -26 ) 25 no. 140 . 11 ; Robert ( 1928 ) 433 -34 ). A Heltic (?) manumission inscription found at Nikaia records the strategos eponymos of the koinon of the Bylliones ( SEG 35 696 ). The ancient remains near Klos have been identified with Nikaia. The site was fortified in C5 . The area enclosed by the wall measures c. 18 ha (Corvisier ( 1991 ) 288 ). The city plan of Nikaia is similar to that of Amantia (Ceka ( 1990 ) 218 -19 )."

The toponym is ' Ολυacute µ πα , αasper (terracotta stamp ( infra )), in koine ' Ολυacute µ πη , ηasper (Steph. Byz. 491 . 3 ). The city-ethnic is probably ' Ολυ µ παστάς (C3 -C2 coins ( infra )). Olympa is called a polis only by Steph. Byz. 491 . 3 ( πόλις Ιλλυρίας ). The reason for including Olympa in this inventory is the evidence for polis status in the Heltic period, combined with the remains of a fortified C5 -C4settlement which is too large to be a kome ( infra ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the C3s-C2f coins ( infra ). A C3l dedication to Zeus Megistos mentions a politarches , the synarchontes and a grammateus ( SEG 35 697 ). Bronze coins of C3s-C2f with the legend ΟΛΥΜΠΑΣΤΑΝ and a terracotta stamped with ΟΛΥΜΠΑΣ , all found near Mavrove,have led to the identification of the ancient remains at this site with Olympa (Dautaj ( 1981 ); Ceka ( 1988 )). The site was fortified in C5l/C4e (ibid. 80 -81 ). The enclosed area measures c. 15 ha (Corvisier ( 1991 ) 288 ). The plan of the town is similar to that of Phoinike (Ceka ( 1990 ) 220 )."
103,Orikos (Orikios),Epeiros,40.2,19.3,348,1658,"103 . Orikos (Orikios) Map 49 . Lat. 40 . 20 , long. 19 . 30 . Size of territory: ? Type: A. The toponym is /acuteΩρικος , οasper (Hdt. 9 . 93 . 1 ; Polyb. 7 . 14 d) or ' Ωρικός ( SEG 43 339 (C5m); Ps.Skylax 26 ), οasper (Polyb. 7 . 14 .d) or ' Ωρικόν , τό (Cass. Dio 41 . 45 . 1 ; Strabo 7 . 5 . 8 (conj.)). The city-ethnic is ' Ωρίκιος ( IG ix 1 2 4 . 1203 (C3 ) ). Orikos is classified as a limen by Hecat. fr. 106 and Hdt. 9 . 93 . 1 . But it is called a polis in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 26 and in Heltic sources (Apollodoros fr. 300 ; Ps.-Skymnos 441 , describing Orikos as a ' Ελληνιgraveς πόλις ). In the Classical period Orikos was probably part of the peraia of Korkyra mentioned by Thuc. 3 . 85 . 2 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in a Korkyraian decree of C3l ( I.Magnesia 44 . 46 = IG ix² . 1 1196 ) and internally in a C3 oracle inquiry ( IG ix 1 2 4 . 1203 ) and on C3 -C2 coins (Head, HN ² 314 -15 ; Hammond ( 1967 ) 639 ). According to the ancient sources, Orikos was situated on the Ionian coast near the Acroceraunian mountains at a distance of 80 miles from Salentinum (Plin. HN 3 . 145 ); the site has been identified with the ancient remains found on an island in the southern part of the Gulf of Valona, which already in Antiquity became connected with the mainland (Plin. HN 2 . 204 ), i.e. modern Pascha Liman (Hammond ( 1976 c )). Orikos is situated on a small promontory which is easily defensible on the landward side. The settlement covered an area of 5 ha (Corvisier ( 1991 ) 287 ). The archaeological remains are scarce. Hammond ( 1967 ) 127 reports a post-Classical circuit wall and towers."
104,Pandosia (Pan-),Epeiros,39.15,20.34,694,3494,"104 . Pandosia (Pan-) Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 15 , long. 20 . 34 . Size of territory: ? Type: A. The toponym is Πανδοσία , ηasper (Dem. 7 . 32 ; Theopomp. fr. 206 ; Strabo 7 . 7 . 5 ). The only attestation of a city-ethnic is in Steph.Byz. 499 . 22 . Heltic coins bear an abbreviated form of the city-ethnic: ΠΑΝ (Head HN ² 321 ; Dakaris ( 1971 b ) 169 ). Pandosia is classified as a polis in the urban sense by Dem. 7 . 32 and by Theopomp.fr. 206 . It is also regarded as being a colony of Elis (no. 251 ) (Dem. 7 . 32 ). Pandosia was a polis belonging to the Kassopians (Theopomp. fr. 206 ), who in turn formed a section of the Thesprotians (Strabo 7 . 7 . 5 , 6 . 1 . 5 ). In C4s Pandosia was a dependency of Kassopa (no. 100 ). Pandosia is recorded in the C4m list of theorodokoi from Epidauros ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 24 ). An oracle from Dodona, misinterpreted by Alexander I, shows that Pandosia was built on three hills near the Acherusian lake and the river Acheron (Strabo 6 . 1 . 5 ) and was situated in the region of Kassopaia (Dem. 7 . 32 ; Strabo 7 . 7 . 5 ). On the basis of the literary sources, Hammond (( 1967 ) 477 -78 , 674 -75 , with map) identified Pandosia with Gourana near modern Trikastro (accepted by Barr .). Dakaris, on the other hand, combined the thesis of Leake (( 1835 ) 4 . 55 , 73 , 75 ) with that of Philippson ( 1956 ) 106 and identified Pandosia with the ancient remains of a site near Kastri: a rounded hill in the middle of the Acheron plain rising to a height of 107 m between Kanalikon and Ephyra. Contrary to the ancient description, the Acheron flows to the south of this hill. Dakaris counters this objection with the suggestion that the course of the Louros has changed and that in Antiquity the river-bed was on the southern side of the hill (Dakaris ( 1971 b) 164 ). Pandosia was connected with the sea by the Acherusian lake and the navigable river Acheron. Dakaris believes that a port existed on the south side of the lake at Dromos Skalomatos, where oak keels of ancient vessels have been found. Another port may have existed on the north side of the lake near the south wall of Pandosia, because ancient metal rings were formerly affixed to the rocks for tying up small ships. The bridge mentioned by Plin. HN 4 . 1 . 4 probably linked the main settlement on Kastri hill with the two northern hillocks (Dakaris ( 1971 b ) 170 ). The site was settled from the prehistoric period (Corvisier ( 1991 ) 201 ). The way Philip besieged and pillaged the land of the colonists (Dem. 7 . 32 ) was one normally adopted against walled cities. Therefore the conquest of Pandosia by Philip II ( 343 / 2 ) constitutes the terminus ante quem of the older walls. This date is in accordance with the style of the walls and the political role Pandosia played at this time. Dakaris suggests that Pandosia was fortified between C5l and 343 / 2 ; the polygonal enclosure encompassed an area of 13 . 1 ha (Dakaris ( 1971 b ) 167 ). The settlement is divided into two parts by an inner wall (ibid. 167 with fig. 42 ; cf. AR ( 2000 -1 ) 67 ). The wall was reinforced with twenty-two towers and had two gates on the eastern side, the southern one leading to the Acherousian lake (Dakaris ( 1971 b ) 167 with fig. 42 ). From the very few remains of buildings it is impossible to reconstruct the city plan (ibid. 168 ). The nature of the terrain makes it most unlikely that the city was grid-planned (ibid. 167 ). On the hill-top two large cisterns are preserved (ibid. 169 -70 )."
105,Passaron,Epeiros,39.4,20.45,286,1398,"105 . Passaron Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 40 , long. 20 . 45 . Size of territory: ? Type: C. The toponym is Πασσαρών , -ῶνος (Plut. Pyrrh . 5 . 5 ) and Passaron (Livy 45 . 26 . 4 ). Passaron is not called a polis in any ancient source. It is described as an oppidum by Livy 45 . 26 . 4 and as a χωρίον τηtildeς Μολλοτίδος by Plut. Pyrrh . 5 . 5 . Passaron is located near Gardiki on the hill above Radotovi in the north-west of modern Ioannina (Dakaris ( 1987 ) 72 ). Decrees found at this site ( SEG 26 719 mentioning the prostates of the Molossoi (after 264 ); Cabanes ( 1976 ) 545 -46 no. 13 ) as well as the literary tradition (Plut. Pyrrh . 5 . 5 ) indicate that Passaron with its temple was the political centre of the Molossians, where the Molossian kings and people exchanged oaths (Plut. Pyrrh . 5 . 5 ). The fortification of the acropolis covering an area of 3 . 65 ha dates from C5s (Dakaris ( 1987 ) 72 ); in C4l a new defence circuit enclosed an additional area of 10 ha (Corvisier ( 1991 ) 213 -14 ). Three cisterns and three gates in the north,south-east and west have been identified. The cavea of a theatre, lying outside the fortification, has been excavated (Dakaris ( 1987 ) 72 fig. 1 ). A C4 temple (Evangelidis ( 1952 ) 306 -8 ) at the foot of the hill is thought to have been the official sanctuary of the Molossoi, where, probably, Zeus Areios was worshipped (Plut. Pyrrh . 5 . 5 )."
106,Phanote (Phanoteus),Epeiros,39.35,20.2,211,954,"106 . Phanote (Phanoteus) Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 35 , long. 20 . 20 . Size of territory: ? Type: C. The toponym is Phanote (Livy 43 . 21 . 4 , 45 . 26 . 3 ). The city-ethnic is Φανοτευacuteς (Polyb. 5 . 96 . 6 , 27 . 16 . 4 ). Phanote is called a polis at Polyb. 5 . 96 . 4 ( επιgrave τηtildeς τῶν Φανοτέων πόλεως ); Livy classifies it as urbs ( 45 . 26 . 3 ) and as castellum Epiri ( 43 . 21 . 4 ). The only reason to include Phanote as a possible polis in the Classical period is the combination of the Heltic site-classification with the remains of a fairly large C4l settlement ( infra ). Phanote is no longer localised at Raveni (Hammond ( 1967 ) 660 ; Barr .) but at modern Doliane (Dakaris ( 1972 ) 40 -41 ). The town was built on a hill on the right side of the Kalamas. An area of c. 5 . 3 ha was fortified in C4l (ibid. 154 ). The main gate was on the northern side (ibid. fig. 56 ). The cemetery was discovered c. 200 m further north (ibid. 155 )."
107,Phoinike,Epeiros,39.5,20.05,238,1075,"107 . Phoinike Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 50 , long. 20 . 05 . Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is [ Φοιν ] ίκα , ηasper ( SEG 23 189 . i . 12 ( c. 330 )). Phoinike is called a polis in the urban sense by Polyb. 2 . 5 . 5 and 2 . 8 . 4 . Polis status in C4 is strongly indicated by the epigraphical and archaeological record: an oracle inquiry of C4l/C3e from Dodone (no. 90 ) filed by αasper πόλις αasper τῶν Χαόνων is ascribed to Phoinike (Dakaris et al . ( 1993 ) 58 = SEG 15 397 . 4 ). Phoinike seems to have been the political centre of the Chaonians from C4m (Cabanes ( 1976 ) 115 -16 ). Phoinike is recorded in the C4s list of theorodokoi from Argos ( SEG 23 189 ; Charneux ( 1966 a ) 156 -239 , ( 1966 b ). The patron god was probably Athena Polias ( SEG 15 397 . 4 (C4l/C3e)). Phoinike has been identified with the ancient site on the hill above modern Finik in southern Albania, where a small walled acropolis of about 1 . 5 ha can be traced back to C5 (Corvisier ( 1991 ) 218 ; Budina ( 1986 ) 119 : 6 ha). In the Heltic period the city grew to cover up to 57 ha."

Αacuteδ µ ατος ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 27 ), if the reading Ποιωνός is correct. Cabanes ( 1997 a ) 97 has no doubt, and Perlman ( 2000 ) 182 rejects the conjecture Τόρωνος suggested by Baunack ( 1895 ) 56 and again by Dakaris ( 1972 ) 34 . Hammond ( 1967 ) 519 suggests that Poinonos might be a personal name. If so, the Thesprotians had four theorodokoi . Because of the geographical order in the list, Cabanes (ibid.) supposes that Poionos was a harbour between Thesprotia and Korkyra (no. 123 )."

Byz. 611 . 21 ( πόλις Θεσπρωτῶν ) and an oppidum by Livy ( 45 . 26 . 4 ). The only reason to include Tekmon in this inventory is the site-classification in Steph. Byz. combined with the remains of a fortified C4settlement which is much too large to be a kome ( infra ). Tekmon is identified with the ancient remains of modern Kastritsa, which is situated on the south side of the lake of Ioannina (Cabanes ( 1997 b) 116 ). Hammond, however, (( 1997 ) 31 ) prefers to identify this site with Eurymenai (no. 97 ). The site was settled from the prehistoric period (Dakaris ( 1951 ), ( 1952 )).

The toponym is Αλυacuteζεα , ηasper ( SEG 15 393 (Dodona, C5 -C4 ); SEG 42 1041 (Ephesos, C4 )) and (in literary sources) Αλυacuteζια (Thuc. 7 . 31 . 2 ), Αλυacuteζεια (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 65 -66 ), Αλυζία (Ps.-Skylax 34 ) or Λυacuteζεια (Hecat. fr. 111 ). The city-ethnic is Αλυζαῖος (on C4s coins, infra ; IG vii 2418 . 18 ( 355 -351 ), with a variant in the same inscription: Αλυζηtildeος (ibid. 5 , cf. SEG 37 531 . 11 )), or Αλυζευacuteς ( IG ix² . 1 582 . 49 (Magnesia, c. 207 )), or-with reference to the ConfederacyΑκαρνάν εξ Αλυζέας ( SEG 42 1041 (Ephesos, C4 ); cf. LGPN IIIA 367 , s.v. Πόλλυς ). Alyzeia is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 34 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in a decree from Thebes (no. 221 ) ( IG vii 2418 . 5 , 16 , 18 ( 355 -351 )) and internally on coins (see infra ) and on an undated tile stamp ( IG ix² . 1 450 ); the individual use is attested externally in two inscriptions from Dodona ( SEG 15 395 (C5 -C4 )) and Ephesos ( SEG 42 1041 (C4 )). Whether Alyzeia was founded by Corinth (no. 227 ) is disputed (for a discussion, see Domingo-Forasté ( 1988 ) 23 -25 ; Schoch ( 1997 ) 33 ). According to ancient tradition, the eponymous hero of the polis was Alyzeus, son of Penelope's father Ikarios and brother of Leukadios ( Alkmaionis fr. 5 , Bernabé; Ephor. fr. 124 ; Strabo 10 . 2 . 9 ). Alyzeia was a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy ( SEG 42 1041 ; cf. IG ix² . 1 582 . 49 ( c. 207 )), during the Third Sacred War allied with Thebes (no. 221 ) ( IG vii 2418 ), and a member of the Hellenic League of 323 ( Staatsverträge 413 ). In 413 slingers and javelin-throwers from Alyzeia were raised by the Athenians (Thuc. 7 . 31 . 2 , 5 ). An Athenian honorific decree of C4s may have bestowed proxenia on a citizen of Alyzeia ( SEG 21 340 . 7 -8 : . . . κράτους Αλ [ υacuteζειον πρόξενον ]; cf. Diod. 18 . 11 . 1 ). Theorodokoi to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) and Epidauros (no. 348 ) are attested for C4 ( SEG 23 189 . i . 6 ( 330 -324 ); IG iv² . 1 95 . 19 ). The urban centre lay at a distance of 15 stades from the sea, the important harbour and precinct of Herakles at modern Mytikas (Strabo 10 . 2 . 21 ; Murray ( 1982 ) 114 -21 ). ⁴ According to the conventions of the database, the ethnics attested in the inscriptions of the Akarnanian Confederacy are classified as external because they were not found 'inside'the respective poleis . On the other hand,the decrees of Korkyra,Same and Ithaka recorded in Magnesia are considered to be internal, because the written documentation alone is external whereas the decisions were taken in the poleis mentioned and the wording is their own. By contrast, the decrees summarised by the Magnesians with καταgrave ταgrave αυταgrave δεgrave εψηφίσαντο are seen as external , the original wording being unknown. Alyzeia must have been fortified before 391 (ibid. 112 -13 ). There are remains of the circuit walls 2 . 3 km long (apart from the southern wall, which has almost completely disappeared), with twenty-four towers, mostly of polygonal construction (ibid. 106 -13 ), and a fortified acropolis at the north-east extremity of the city (ibid. 110 -11 ). The walls enclosed an area of 27 ha. Alyzeia struck coins between 350 and 330 ( BMCCorinth , lviii, with reference to Imhoof-Blumer ( 1878 ) 47 ; Head, HN ² 329 ). Corinthian staters ( c. 340 -290 ; types: obv . Pegasos; rev . Athena) with the legend ΑΛΥΖΑΙΩΝ or ΑΛΥ were found in Sicilian hoards (Talbert ( 1971 ) 61 ; IGCH nos. 88 , 2144 -45 , 2151 , 2180 -81 , 2187 -88 ; Taliercio Mensitieri and Spagnoli ( 1993 ) pl. 5 f); SNG Cop. Acarnania 280 -82 . Contemporary bronze coins show types related to the cult of Herakles (Head, HN ² 429 )."
113,Ambrakia (Ambrakiotes),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,39.1,21.0,2114,9398,"113 . Ambrakia (Ambrakiotes) Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 10 , long. 21 . 00 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A.

Hell . 6 . 2 . 3 ; Ps.-Skylax 33 ). The city-ethnic is Α µ πρακιώτας , -της (Hdt. 8 . 45 ; Thuc. 1 . 46 . 1 ; Xen. An . 1 . 7 . 18 ; ML 27 . 11 ( 479 ); CID ii 4 . iii . 28 ( 363 ), and coin legends, see infra ) or Α µ βρακιῶτας , -της (Hellan. fr. 83 ; IG ii² 236 .b. 6 ( 338 / 7 ); and coin legends, see infra ) or Α µ βρακιάτ [ ης ] (Parke ( 1967 ) 267 no. 12 ; SGDI 3184 : Α µ βρακιά [ τας ] from Dodona ( c. C3 )) or Α µ βρακῖνος (Philistos ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 62 ). Ambrakia is called a polis in the urban sense by Thuc. 3 . 105 . 4 , 110 . 1 , 112 . 1 , 8 , 113 . 2 , 4 , 5 ; Ps.-Skylax 33 ; and in the political sense by Thuc. 3 . 113 . 6 and 7 . 25 . 9 ; it is subsumed under the heading poleis at Thuc. 2 . 9 . 2 , 3 . A polites is attested in an inscription ( SEG 41 540 A. 9 (C6 )), and among the Aristotelian politeiai there was one of Ambrakia (fr. 481 . 1 ). In an early inscription Ambrakia is referred to as patris ( SEG 41 540 A. 9 (C6 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally on the Serpent Column from Delphi (ML 27 . 11 ) and in other inscriptions ( IG ii² 236 .b. 6 ; SEG 9 2 . 19 , 56 -57 = Tod 196 ( 330 -325 )), internally on coins (see infra ; cf. the undated tile stamp SEG 34 588 c). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally, especially in inscriptions at Delphi ( CID ii 4 . iii . 28 ; SEG 31 535 . 2 (both C4 )). The name of the territory was Α µ βρακία (Archestratos fr. 16 . 1 , Olson and Sens = Suppl. Hell . 146 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 33 ; Etym. Magn . 81 . 3 -4 ). It is briefly described by Polyb. 21 . 26 . 3 -4 . Ambrakia bordered on the Thesprotians (Hdt. 8 . 47 ) and on the Amphilochians (Hecat.fr. 26 ; Thuc. 2 . 68 . 5 ), and was situated in the region of Dryopis (Dion. Calliphon. 30 , GGM i 239 ); Athanadas ( FGrHist 303 ) fr. 1 ). It had a λι µ ηgraveν κλειστός (Ps.-Skylax 33 ; Dion. Calliphon. 29 -30 , GGM I 239 ), and a fort Αacute µ βρακος stood in the lagoons of the river Arachthus (Polyb. 4 . 61 . 4 -8 , 63 . 1 -2 ; Steph. Byz. 85 . 10 calls it a πολίχνιον ), which can be identified with remains on the island of Phidokastro (Hammond ( 1967 ) 138 ; TzouvaraSouli ( 1992 ) 208 -9 ). Two other settlements are mentioned by Steph. Byz. ( 381 . 13 with reference to Theopomp. fr. 229 ( Κράνεια · χωρίον Α µ βρακιωτῶν ), 377 . 17 ( Κορώνεια · φρουacuteριον τηtildeς Α µ βρακίας )). Another fortress, Herakleia, with a sanctuary of Herakles, occurs in a Heltic inscription ( SEG 35 665 .A. 18 , 27 ( c. 160 )). The territory was divided into µ έρη ( ∆εξα µ εναί , Steph. Byz. 225 . 10 ) and a µ έρος ποτ ' /asperacuteΟρραον ( SEG 35 665 .A. 18 , 20 ( c. 160 )) are attested), but they must not have been administrative units. Ambrakia was founded by Corinthians (no. 227 ) (Thuc. 2 . 80 . 3 ; Dem. 3 . 34 ) at the time of Kypselos (Strabo 7 . 6 . 6 , 10 . 2 . 8 ; Ant. Lib. Met . 4 . 4 ), i.e. between 657 / 6 and 627 / 6 (for the date of Kypselos, see Gehrke ( 1990 ) 34 ). The oecist was Gorgos, son of Kypselos (Ps.-Skymnos 455 ; Nic. Dam. ( FGrHist 90 ) fr. 59 . 1 ; Strabo 10 . 2 . 8 (MS Gargasos); Ant. Lib. Met . 4 . 4 (MS Torgos);one coin attested: Kraay ( 1976 ) no. 428 with the name added). After the expulsion of the tyrant Periander (Arist. Pol . 1304 a 31 -33 , 1311 a 40 - b 1 ; cf. Plut. Mor . 768 F (rC6 )), Ambrakia was organised as a moderate oligarchy with a low census, later as a democracy (Arist. Pol . 1303 a 20 -25 ; Diod. 17 . 3 . 3 ; cf. Gehrke, Stasis 19 ; Schütrumpf and Gehrke ( 1996 ) 455 ). After the battle of Chaironeia, an oligarchy was established, supported by a Makedonian garrison, but after the death of Philip II, Ambrakia became democratic again (Diod. 17 . 3 . 3 , 4 . 3 ; cf. Gehrke, Stasis 19 ). The historical circumstances of the tyranny of a certain Phalaikos (or Phaylos) in Ambrakia (e.g.Ant.Lib. Met . 4 . 4 -5 ) remain dubious,cf.Keyßner ( 1938 ) 1612 . Ambrakia was a member of the Hellenic League against Persia (Hdt. 8 . 45 , 47 , 9 . 28 . 5 , 9 . 31 . 4 ; Staatsverträge 130 ). Before the Peloponnesian War, it sided with the Corinthians (no. 227 ) against Korkyra (no. 123 ) and acted, consistently, as a Spartan ally during the war (Thuc. 2 . 9 . 2 , 2 . 80 . 5 , 3 . 105 . 1 , 6 . 104 . 1 , 8 . 106 . 3 ), although in 426 it was forced to conclude a symmachia and a treaty with the Akarnanians and the Amphilochians (Thuc. 3 . 114 . 3 ; Staatsverträge 175 ). In 395 , Ambrakia became a member of the alliance between Boiotia, Athens (no. 361 ), Corinth (no. 227 ) and Argos (no. 347 ) against Sparta (no. 345 ) (Diod. 14 . 82 . 3 ; Staatsverträge 225 ), but it sided with Sparta against Athens and Korkyra in 375 and 373 / 2 (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 65 -66 , 6 . 2 . 3 ).Ambrakia is attested as a member of the Corinthian League of 338 / 7 ( IG ii² 236 .b. 6 ; Staatsverträge 130 ) and of the Hellenic League of 323 ( Staatsverträge 413 ). In 317 / 16 , it was allied with Olympias (Diod. 19 . 35 . 7 ). Ambrakia was engaged with contingents in the following battles: against Korkyra on the river Arachthus c. 600 ( CEG i 145 ; cf. Hammond ( 1967 ) 493 ; Andreou ( 1991 ) 436 -38 ); against the Perrhaibians together with Corinth (no. 227 ) in C6 ( SEG 41 540 A. 7 ; cf. Cassio ( 1994 ) and SEG 44 463 ); at Salamis with seven ships (Hdt. 8 . 45 ); at Plataiai with 500 hoplites (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 5 , 31 . 4 ); at Epidamnos in 435 with eight ships (Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 ); at Sybota in 433 with 27 (Thuc. 1 . 46 . 1 ); and against Korkyra together with Leukas (no. 126 ) in 427 with thirteen ships (Thuc. 3 . 69 . 1 ). In 425 , Ambrakia went to war against Akarnania and Amphilochian Argos (no. 115 ) with at least 3 , 000 hoplites (Thuc. 3 . 105 . 1 ), and in 414 , three Ambrakian ships joined the Corinthian fleet (Thuc. 6 . 104 . 1 ). In 405 , the Ambrakian Euantidas fought under Lysander's command at Aigos potamoi (Paus. 10 . 9 . 10 ). In 375 and 373 / 2 , Ambrakia supported the Peloponnesian navy with six ships (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 65 -66 , 6 . 2 . 3 ). The patron deities were Apollo Soter (or Agyieus) and Herakles; cf. the aition reported by Ant. Lib. Met . 4 (cf. SEG 35 665 .B. 33 -34 , 45 (C2 ), with Cabanes and Andréou ( 1985 ) 513 , 531 , 533 -34 ; Jacoby, comm. in Athanadas ( FGrHist 303 ); Tzouvara-Souli ( 1992 ) 197 -200 ). The Ambrakians used a Dorian calendar like Corinth (no. 227 ) and Korkyra (Bischoff ( 1919 ) 1592 no. 32 ; cf. Cabanes and Andréou ( 1985 ) 536 -37 ). Sophron of Ambrakia is recorded as a winner in the Olympic Games of 432 ( Olympionikai 321 ). The eponymous hero of the polis was Ambrax, son of Thesprotos and grandson of Lykaon (Steph.Byz. 84 . 22 -85 . 1 ; Eust. Comm.Dionys. Per . 493 , but see Hecat. fr. 26 ) or son of Dexamenos and grandson of Herakles (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom. 1 . 50 . 4 ). According to another version, Ambrakia, daughter of the Dryopian king Melaneus or Augeas or Phorbas, son of Helios, was eponymous (cf. Ant. Lib. Met . 4 . 3 ; Steph. Byz. 85 . 1 -2 , 225 . 11 -12 ; Eust. Comm. Dionys. Per . 493 ). Ambrakian theorodokoi are attested for theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ; SEG 23 189 . i . 10 ( 330 -324 )), Delphi (no. 177 ) ( SEG 31 535 . 2 ( c. 320 )) and Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 32 , 81 -82 ( 356 / 5 )). In the Delphic decree a grant of proxenia was added to the grant of theorodokia ( SEG 31 535 . 3 ). Public architecture is not attested before the Heltic period, nor are there ruins of older public buildings except for the remains of a late Archaic temple (Tzouvara-Souli ( 1992 ) 43 ; Lang ( 1996 ) 296 with n. 529 ). The acropolis was situated on the hill called Perranthes (Livy 38 . 4 . 1 , 4 . 6 , 5 . 2 ; cf. Hammond ( 1967 ) 143 ). The walls mentioned by Livy ( 38 . 4 . 4 ) belong primarily to the time of Pyrrhos; they enclose an area of c. 130 ha, but there are remains of the older walls of late Archaic or Classical times (Hammond ( 1967 ) 141 -44 , 481 , 584 -85 , 659 ; Cabanes and Andréou ( 1985 ) 525 -27 (sketch); Pritchett ( 1992 ) 120 with reference to Catling; TzouvaraSouli ( 1992 ) 26 -31 ; Andréou ( 1993 ) 93 -94 ; Lang ( 1996 ) 296 ). The city buildings follow a plan with a rectangular road system (Tzouvara-Souli ( 1992 ) 31 -33 ; Andréou ( 1993 ) 93 -94 ; Lang ( 1996 ) 297 -98 ) in both Archaic and Classical times. It has been suggested that one of the two theatres attested by archaeology goes back to C4l ( TGR ii. 129 ) and is the one referred to at Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 1 . 50 . 4 (cf. Frederiksen ( 2002 ) 72 ). Ambrakia struck coins on the Corinthian standard and with Corinthian types (pegasi) in about 480 , in the 430 s and in C4s (Kraay ( 1977 ), ( 1979 ), and Talbert ( 1971 ); IGCH passim (cf. p. 395 ); Kraay ( 1976 ) 126 -28 ; Taliercio Mensitieri and Spagnoli ( 1993 ), especially pls. 3 and 5 b-f, h, i, l; CH viii. 226 , 450 , 530 ). They bear the legends ΑΜΠΡΑΚΙΟΤΑΝ , ΑΜΠΡΑΚΙΩΤΑΝ , or ΑΜΒΡΑΚΙΩΤΑΝ and various abbreviations (Head, HN ² 319 -20 ; Franke ( 1961 ) 323 -32 ; Hammond ( 1967 ) 717 -31 ; Tzouvara-Souli ( 1992 ) 127 -32 ; cf.

114,Anaktorion (Anaktorieus),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,38.55,20.5,1097,5101,"114 . Anaktorion (Anaktorieus) Map 54 . Lat. 38 . 55 , long. 20 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Ανακτόριον (Thuc. 1 . 55 . 1 ; IG iv² . 1 95 . 22 ( 356 / 5 )), originally Γaltανακτόριον (cf. the city-ethnic Γaltανακτορι ˜ ες ). The cityethnic is Ανακτοριευacuteς (coins with ΑΝΑΚΤΟΡΙΕΩΝ ( infra ); IG ix² . 1 3 A. 24 ( 263 ?)), originally Γaltανακτοριευacuteς (ML 27 . 10 (Delphi, 479 ), and the earliest coin legend), or Ανακτόριος (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 5 ; Thuc. 1 . 46 . 1 ; coins with ΑΝΑΚΤΟΡΙΩΝ ( infra )). Anaktorion is called a polis in the urban and political senses simultaneously by Thuc. 4 . 49 (Hansen ( 1998 ) 32 -33 ); in the urban sense implicitly by Ps.-Skylax 34 , and in the political sense Anaktorion is subsumed under the heading poleis at Thuc. 1 . 46 . 1 -2 and 2 . 9 . 2 -3 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally on the Serpent Column from Delphi (ML 27 . 10 ( 479 )) and internally on coins (see infra ). The individual use of the cityethnic is attested in the inscription concerning the cult of Artemis Leukophryene in Magnesia ( IG ix² . 1 582 . 5 ( c. 207 )). The name of the territory was Ανακτορία γηtilde (Thuc. 1 . 29 . 3 ) situated επιgrave τΩsubiotaῶ στό µ ατι τουtilde Α µ βρακικουtilde κόλπου (Thuc. 1 . 55 . 1 , 4 . 49 ), 40 stades from Actium (Strabo 10 . 2 . 7 ). Anaktorion possessed a λι µ ήν (Ps.-Skylax 34 ) inside the Gulf of Arta and another εκτός , at the sanctuary of Apollo Aktios (Strabo 10 . 2 . 7 ). Anaktorion was part of Akarnania according to the theorodokoi lists ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 8 + 22 ; SEG 36 331 .A. 15 + 20 (both C4s)) and Ps.-Skylax 34 . Anaktorion was founded by Corinthians (no. 227 ; Paus. 5 . 23 . 3 ; Steph. Byz. 92 . 15 -16 ; the participation of Korkyra (no. 123 ) is disputed; cf. Domingo-Forasté ( 1988 ) 6 -42 ; De Fidio ( 1995 ) 125 ff) at the time of Kypselos ( 657 / 6 -627 / 6 ; for the date,see Gehrke ( 1990 ) 34 ; Strabo 10 . 2 . 8 ; Nic. Dam.( FGrHist 90 ) fr. 57 . 7 ). For a discussion of Plut. Mor . 552 E (colonisation of Anaktorion under Periander's rule), see DomingoForasté ( 1988 ) 8 -11 . The oecist was Echiades (Nic. Dam. loc. cit .). Thucydides' description of Anaktorion as Κορινθίων πόλις ( 4 . 49 ) indicates that in C5 it was still, at least to some extent, controlled by its metropolis . During the Great Persian War, Anaktorion belonged to the Hellenic League (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 5 , 31 . 4 ; ML 27 . 10 ; Staatsverträge 130 ). It is attested as a symmachos of Sparta (no. 345 ) in 431 and 429 (Thuc. 2 . 9 . 2 , 80 . 5 ) and entered into alliance with Thebes (no. 221 ) during the Third Sacred War ( IG vii 2418 ). In the battle of Plataiai, Anaktorion was present, together with Leukas (no. 126 ), with 800 hoplites (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 5 ). During the Korkyra campaign of 435 , it joined the Corinthians (no. 227 ) with one ship under its own commander (Thuc. 1 . 46 . 1 ). Being founded by Corinthians, Anaktorion was κοινοgraveν Κερκυραίων καιgrave εκείνων (Thuc. 1 . 55 . 1 ). In 432 it was captured by the Corinthians and received new Corinthian settlers (ibid.; Losada ( 1972 ) 17 ). When it was captured by Athenians and Akarnanians in 425 , the Akarnanians sent new colonists (Thuc. 4 . 49 , probably reflected in Ps.-Skymnos 460 -61 ). After that, Anaktorion must have been a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy (Freitag ( 1996 ) 85 -86 , attested in IG ix² . 1 3 A. 24 ( 263 ?), 583 . 8 ( 216 ), 582 . 41 ( c. 207 )). Theorodokoi were appointed to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) ( SEG 23 189 . i . 3 ( 330 -324 )), Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 22 , 76 -77 ( 356 / 5 )) and Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .A. 20 -23 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). The public assembly of Anaktorion was called halia , the eponymous magistrate was a prytanis ( IG ix² . 1 212 . 1 , 3 (C4 -C3 )); cf. Sherk ( 1990 a ) 257 . The famous sanctuary of Apollo Aktios was situated outside the city (Thuc. 1 . 29 . 3 ; cf. IG ix² . 1 583 . 14 -15 , 54 (Olympia, 216 ) and 582 . 40 -41 (Magnesia, c. 207 )), with a temple of Apollo (Strabo 7 . 7 . 6 ), a Helenaion , other unknown structures εν τ . [ ῶι ά ] λσει and parembolai , i.e. places for camping visitors ( IG ix² . 1 583 . 38 -41 ; cf. Habicht ( 1957 ) 98 -102 ). There was a festival ( ηasper Ακτιάς , IG ix² . 1 583 . 45 ; cf. BE ( 1956 ) 11 ) with agones . From C4 onward, some types of coins refer to this cult and festival. The circuit of the city walls was described by Leake ( 1835 ) 493 -94 (cf. Strauch ( 1996 a ) 377 ). Thucydides reports at 4 . 49 that Anaktorion in 425 was betrayed to the Athenians, an indication that the town was fortified. Anaktorion struck coins on the Corinthian standard and with Corinthian types (pegasi) in the 430 s and in C4s (Imhoof-Blumer ( 1878 ) 53 ff; Kraay ( 1979 ) 53 , 55 ; DomingoForasté ( 1988 ) 132 -46 and ( 1993 ); Talbert ( 1971 ) 61 ; IGCHpassim (cf. p. 395 ); Taliercio Mensitieri and Spagnoli ( 1993 ) pl. 3 ; CH viii. 159 , 167 , 232 ; cf. in general Head, HN ² 329 ). The coins bear the legends ΑΝΑΚΤΟΡΙΕΩΝ , ΑΝΑΚΤΟΡΙΩΝ and various abbreviations, the oldest coins use initial Γalt ."
115,Argos (Argeios),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,38.55,21.1,975,4627,"115 . Argos (Argeios) Map 54 . Lat. 38 . 55 , long. 21 . 10 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: A. The toponym is Αacuteργος , τό (Thuc. 3 . 105 . 2 ; IG iv² . 1 95 . 33 ( 356 / 5 )) or Αacuteργος τοgrave Α µ φιλοχικόν (Hecat. fr. 102 c; Thuc. 2 . 68 . 1 , 3 ). The city-ethnic is Αργεῖος (Thuc. 3 . 105 . 1 ; Cabanes ( 1976 ) 586 no. 70 . 7 (Dodona, C4 )) and Αργεῖος οasper Α µ φίλοχος ( IG ix² . 1 186 . 16 (Magnesia, c. 207 )) or Α µ φίλοχος εξ Αacuteργεος ( F.Delphes iii . 4 407 ( 325 -275 )). ⁵ Argos is called a polis in the urban sense by Thuc. 2 . 68 . 9 , 3 . 105 . 1 , 106 . 3 , and by Ps.-Skylax 34 ; the territorial sense is a connotation at Thuc. 2 . 68 . 4 and 6 , as is the political sense at 2 . 68 . 4 . At Hecat. fr. 102 c = Strabo 6 . 2 . 4 we cannot be certain that the term polis stems from Hekataios. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally by Thucydides (see supra ) and internally on C4s coins (see infra ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in an Athenian proxeny decree ( IG ii² 374 . 11 -12 ( 322 / 1 )) and in Dodona (see supra ). The territory was called Αργεῖα (Thuc. 3 . 105 . 1 , 106 . 3 ) or Α µ φιλοχία (Thuc. 3 . 105 . 2 ). There existed at least three other settlements within the territory: Olpai ( τεῖχος , Thuc. 3 . 105 . 1 ), Metropolis (Thuc. 3 . 107 . 1 ; Pritchett ( 1992 ) 25 -27 ) and Krenai ( χωρίον , Thuc. 3 . 105 . 2 ). In C5 , Limnaia (no. 127 ) ⁵ Perhaps other Argeioi are mentioned in Greek inscriptions, but normally an Argeios will be identified with a citizen of the famous city in the Argolid. But the Argeios named in the inscription published by Cabanes ( 1976 ) 586 no. 70 . 7 (Dodona,C4 ) looks like a neighbour of the two other persons, a Horraitas and a Dodonaios; cf. also the Argeioi in IG ix . 1² 1 25 . 10 , 49 -50 ; 30 . 21 , 24 , 29 . was part of the Argeia too (Thuc. 2 . 80 . 8 ). The Argeia was situated between Epiros and Akarnania; cf. also IG iv² . 1 95 . 33 . The mythical founder of Argos was Amphilochos (Hecat. fr. 102 c; Thuc. 2 . 68 . 3 ; Ps.-Skymnos 455 -57 , according to Ephor. fr. 123 b together with his father and brother, sc . Akarnan), the son of Alkmaion (Ephor. fr. 123 b) or Amphiaraos (Thuc. 2 . 68 . 3 ; Ps.-Skymnos 455 -57 ). According to Thuc. 2 . 68 . 5 , only the Argeians (together with the Ambrakiot settlers expelled at about 440 bc , see infra), probably the population of the urban centre, were Hellenes while the other Amphilochians were Barbarian (for a discussion of the problem cf . Hammond [ 1967 ] 419 ; Hornblower [ 1991 ] 353 -3 ). Whether Argos was a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy is disputed (Klaffenbach ( 1957 ) xviii against Beloch ( 1922 ) 291 ). In about 440 the Amphilochians were expelled by Ambrakian settlers, but some two years later, with Athenian aid, they were resettled together with Akarnanians in Argos, while the Ambrakian settlers were exposed to andrapodismos (Thuc. 2 . 68 . 5 -7 ; Gehrke, Stasis 34 ). At least there must have been a special relationship between Argos and the Akarnanian Confederacy (Gehrke ( 1994 -95 ) 43 with n. 6 ). The Argeian/Akarnanian physician Euenor was honoured by the Athenians with proxeny ( IG ii² 242 + 373 ( 337 / 6 )), later citizenship ( IG ii² 374 ( 322 / 1 )). Argeian theorodokoi hosted theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) ( SEG 23 189 . i . 9 ( 330 -324 )) and Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 33 ). The surviving walls at the site of Neochori are described by Pritchett ( 1992 ) 20 -21 (with pls. 22 -25 ), those of Palaioavli, Pritchett's candidate for Argos, ibid. 17 (with pls. 9 -21 ). Argos is commonly connected with the ruins near Ag. Ioannis/Neochori (Heuzey ( 1860 ) 282 ff; Oberhummer ( 1887 ) 26 -27 ; Strauch ( 1996 c ); Barr .); for a recent discussion, see Hammond ( 1967 ) 246 and Pritchett ( 1992 ) 13 -21 , who locate Argos at Palaioavli (cf. Schoch ( 1997 ) 38 ); but the remains at Neochori are much more impressive and thus a better candidate for a major polis site than the ruins at Palaioavli (probably ancient Krenai, see supra 353 ). Thucydides' description of the unsuccessful Ambrakian attack on Argos in 430 indicates that the city was fortified (Thuc. 2 . 68 . 9 ). Argos struck coins of silver and bronze on the Corinthian standard and with Corinthian types in C4s (Talbert ( 1971 ) 61 ; IGCH passim (cf. p. 396 ); Taliercio Mensitieri and Spagnoli ( 1993 ) pls. 3 , 5 ; CH viii. 159 , 167 , 232 , 431 ; cf. in general ImhoofBlumer ( 1878 ) 82 -97 ). The coins bear the legends ΑΡΓΙΩΝ , ΑΡΓΕΩΝ , ΑΡΓΕΙΩΝ , or ΑΜΦΙΛΟΧΩΝ and various abbreviations. SNG Cop.Acarnania 308 -22 ."
116,Astakos (Astakenos),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,38.35,21.05,682,3215,"11 6. Astakos (Astakenos) Map 54 . Lat. 38 . 35 , long. 21 . 05 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Αστακός , ηasper (Thuc. 2 . 30 . 1 , 33 . 1 ) or Αστακοί (only in inscriptions: IG iv² . 1 95 . 14 ( 356 / 5 ); SEG 36 331 .A. 52 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). The cityethnic (not attested before the Heltic period) is Αστακός ( IG ix² . 1 443 (C3 -C2 ); IG ix² . 1 208 . 4 , 33 (C2 ); cf. Klaffenbach ( 1957 ) 87 ) or Αστακηνός ( SEG 43 35 (C3 )). A C4 Attic inscription ( IG ii² 266 ) has Ακαρναtildeνες εξ Ασ [ τακουtilde ( vel Ασ [ τακῶν ]). There was another city named Astakos in Bithynia (no. 737 ). Well known, e.g. as a member of the Delian League, this polis (destroyed and refounded by the Bithynian king Zipoites near the former site) took the name Nikomedeia in early C3 . Therefore, all Astak(en)oi attested in Heltic inscriptions must be seen as citizens of the Akarnanian polis , e.g. the paroikos Nikon Astakenos at Rhamnous ( SEG 43 53 (C3 after 229 )). Only the πατριgraveς Αστακίη ( SEG 4 105 (Rome, first century ad )) may refer poetically to Nikomedeia, cf. e.g. Nonnus, Dion. 14 . 327 , 16 . 166 or Anth. Pal. 7 . 627 . 3 . Astakos is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 34 , who also classifies Astakos as a limen . Thuc. 2 . 30 . 1 has χωρίον . The collective use of the equivalent of the city-ethnic is attested externally in an Athenian inscription ( IG ii² 266 ) and internally on a stamped tile ( IG ix² . 1 443 (C3 -C2 )). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in,e.g., SEG 43 53 (Rhamnous, C3 ), see n. 7 . The bay near Astakos is named Αστακηνοgraveς κόλπος by Strabo 10 . 2 . 21 . Steph. Byz. 137 . 6 calls Astakos Κεφαλληνίας άποικον , but, according to Kirsten (( 1940 ) 298 ), it may have been a colony of Corinth (no. 227 ), like Anaktorion (no. 114 ), Ambrakia (no. 113 ) and Leukas (no. 126 ; cf. Wacker ( 1996 a ) 99 with n. 6 ; Schoch ( 1997 ) 42 ; contra Klaffenbach ( 1957 a ) x ). According to the theorodokoi lists, Astakos was part of Akarnania ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 8 + 14 ( 356 / 5 )).After the expulsion of the tyrant Euarchos in 431 (Thuc. 2 . 30 . 1 ), repeated after his return in 429 , Astakos became an Athenian ally and, probably, a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy (cf. Gomme ad Thuc. 2 . 102 . 1 ). The membership is attested only later ( IG ix² . 1 208 , 209 (C2 )). Theorodokoi to host theoroi are attested in Epidauros (no. 348 ; IG iv² . 1 95 . 14 , 63 ( 356 / 5 )) and in Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .A. 52 -53 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). Ruins of a sanctuary of Zeus Kara(i)os have been found 200 m west of the western gate; they can be identified by an inscription of C2 ( IG ix² . 1 434 ). The remains of the ancient walls, visible today as foundations of a mediaeval wall, are poorly preserved (Wacker ( 1996 a ) 101 ). The masonry suggests different phases (Murray ( 1982 ) 69 -70 ), the first being probably C5 (Oberhummer ( 1887 ) 212 ; Philippson and Kirsten ( 1958 ) 395 ). Astakos struck silver coins perhaps only in C4s, on the Corinthian standard and with Corinthian types: obv . Pegasos; rev . head of Athena with an astakos (i.e. a crayfish); legend: ΑΣ (Imhoof-Blumer ( 1878 ) 97 -99 ; Head, HN ² 329 ; CH viii. 232 )."
117,Derion (Derieus),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,38.4,21.2,441,2134,"117 . Derion (Derieus) Map 54 . Lat. 38 . 40 , long. 21 . 20 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. The toponym is ∆ήριον , τό ( SEG 36 331 .A. 41 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). The city-ethnic is ∆εριευacuteς ( IAEpi 42 . 61 , 65 (C3 ); Diod. 19 . 67 . 4 (r 314 )) or ∆ηριευacuteς ( IG ix² . 1 3 A. 23 ( 263 ?)). Derion is probably to be connected with the ruins at Skourtou in central Akarnania (Rhomaios ( 1918 ) 113 -14 ; cf. the discussion by Pritchett ( 1992 ) 81 -85 ); it is not attested as a polis in our sources. If the identification with the ruins of Skourtou is correct, Derion had an urban centre and may have been a polis already in C5 -C4 , not just one of the έθνη attested in IG ix² . 1 583 . 40 (Olympia, 216 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally by Diod. 19 . 67 . 4 (r 314 ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in an inscription from the Asklepieion at Epidauros ( IAEpi 42 . 61 , 65 (C4l-C3e)) and in the treaty of 263 (?) between the Aitolians and Akarnanians ( IG ix² . 1 3 A. 23 ). According to the Nemean theorodokoi list, Derion was part of Akarnania ( SEG 36 331 .A. 15 + 41 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). At least in 314 it was a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy (Diod. 19 . 67 . 4 ; IG ix² . 1 3 A. 23 ; cf. also the theorodokoi lists cited below). In C4l-C3e Aristarchidas of Derion was appointed proxenos by Epidauros (no. 348 ) for having hosted theoroi from there ( IAEpi 42 . 61 , 65 ). Other theorodokoi are attested in the Nemean List ( SEG 36 331 .A. 41 -43 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). The remains of the site at Skourtou have recently been described by Pritchett ( 1992 ) 81 -85 , who refers to the acropolis,a possible temple site (citing Woodhouse) and the walls, and mentions 'pieces of glazed pottery' of C5 (ibid. 85 ). However, there is a problem concerning the walls: Diodorus speaks of &lt; αν &gt; οχυacuteρων καιgrave µ ικρῶν χωρίων and of διεσπαρ µ ένης τηtildeς οικήσεως and mentions ∆εριεῖς in that context ( 19 . 67 . 3 -5 ). But &lt; αν &gt; οχυacuteρων is a conjecture (by Reiske and Dindorf); the MSS have οχυacuteρων , and Diodorus writes in general terms."
118,Echinos (Echinaios),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,38.55,20.55,641,3054,"11 8. Echinos (Echinaios) Map 54 . Lat. 38 . 55 , long. 20 . 55 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: B. The toponym is ' Εχίνεος , οasper ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 17 ( 356 / 5 )) or ' Εχῖνος ( SEG 36 331 .A. 24 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). The city-ethnic is ' Εχιναῖος ( IG ii² 208 . 1 , 7 (suppl.) = Staatsverträge 325 ( 349 / 8 )). Perhaps more Akarnanian Echinaioi are mentioned in Greek inscriptions, but normally an Echinaios will be identified with a citizen of the homonymous city in Malis, cf. e.g. SEG 25 642 ( 168 / 7 ). Echinos is, in all probability, to be located at the ancient site of the Kastro of Prophitis Elias (Pritchett ( 1992 ) 93 -101 ). Echinos is commonly located on the bay of Rouga (Heuzey ( 1860 ) 375 -76 ; Oberhummer ( 1887 ) 36 ; Philippson ( 1905 ); Klaffenbach ( 1957 ) 33 ). But Rouga is an obvious place for the harbour of Thyrreion (no. 139 ). According to an inscription found during an excavation at Rouga by L. Kolonas (not yet published), its probable name was Nesos. Echinos is not attested as a polis . The Heltic poet Rhianos of Bene called it άστυ (Steph. Byz. 292 . 16 -17 : ' Εχίονος άστυ , /acuteΕχιον (?) άστυ conj . Jacoby, FGrHist 265 , fr. 34 ).As a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy which had an urban centre and presumably struck coins, Echinos was probably a polis , at least from C4 ( infra ). The external use of the city-ethnic is attested in an Attic decree of 349 / 8 ( IG ii² 208 , the individual use in line 1 , the collective in line 7 (suppl.)). For the individual use, see also Ακαρναgraveν απ ' ' Εχίνου , in a funerary epigram from Kos ( IG ix² . 1 579 . 6 (C3 )). According to the theorodokoi lists, Echinos was part of Akarnania ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 8 + 17 ( 356 / 5 ); SEG 36 331 .A. 15 + 24 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). The mythical founder and eponym was Echinos (Rhianos ( FGrHist 265 ) fr. 34 = Steph. Byz. 292 . 16 -17 ). Membership of the Akarnanian Confederacy is well attested ( IG ii² 208 . 1 , 6 ff = Staatsverträge 325 ( 349 / 8 ), cf. IG ix² . 1 579 . 6 (C3 )). Echinos sent envoys to Athens (no. 361 ) in 349 / 8 ( IG ii² 208 ; cf. Wilhelm ( 1889 ) 127 -30 ), and there were Echinaian theorodokoi to host theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ) and from Nemea ( supra ). The remains of the site of Kastro to be identified with Echinos are described by Pritchett ( 1992 ) 93 -97 , who mentions Geometric,Classical and Heltic pottery.The walls have been compared with those of Rhamnous and Eleutherai by Heuzey ( 1860 ) 381 -82 . A temenos of Apollo is attested in an epigram found at the Kastro ( IG ix² . 1 238 . 5 ; cf. now Pritchett ( 1992 ) 95 ). A Pegasos-type stater on the Corinthian standard ( obv . head of Athena with fish-hook; legend: E) has tentatively been attributed to Echinos (Imhoof-Blumer ( 1878 ) 100 ; Head, HN ² 329 ). Since then, eight coins of this type have been found in Sicilian and South Italian hoards (Talbert ( 1971 ) 62 ; IGCH no. 2187 ; Taliercio Mensitieri and Spagnoli ( 1993 ) especially pls. 1 , 3 ; CH viii. 232 ); the coinage can be dated to C4s: SNG Cop.Acarnania 324 ."
119,Euripos (Euripios),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,38.55,21.0,368,1820,"119 . Euripos (Euripios) Map 54 . Lat. 38 . 55 , long. 21 . 00 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: B. The toponym is Ευacuteριπος , οasper (Ps.Skylax 34 according to the MS; cf. Marcotte ( 1985 ) 254 ; IG iv² . 1 95 . 15 ( 356 / 5 )). The city-ethnic is Ευρίπιος ( ArchDelt 22 B. 2 ( 1967 ) 321 ; BE ( 1970 ) 343 (C3s); cf. Antonetti ( 1987 ) 100 -1 ; Strauch ( 1996 a ) 282 -83 , 319 ; but the connection with the Akarnanian Euripos is not beyond doubt; there are also inscriptions relating to other euripoi / Euripoi , e.g. SEG 3 415 ). Euripos is presumably to be located west of the site Saradiniko on the west bank of the river Nissis near Loutraki (described by Pritchett ( 1994 ) 192 -95 ). Pritchett ( 1992 ) 90 -92 locates Euripos on the Bay of Rouga, but for the connection of that site with the harbour of Thyrreion, see above Echinos (no. 118 ); cf. Kirsten ( 1941 a ) 108 n. 3 ; Schwandner in AA ( 1991 ) 614 . Euripos is not attested as a polis in the sources, but from the passage of Ps.-Skylax ( supra ) and,particularly,from the theorodokoi lists concerning Akarnania (see infra ), we have to infer that it was a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy. Since remains of a Classical and Heltic urban settlement with a cemetery exist west of the above-mentioned Late Heltic/Roman site of Saradiniko (information from E.-L. Schwandner), Euripos was probably a polis , at least from C4 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in a C3s building inscription at Makryada ( ArchDelt 22 B. 2 ( 1967 ), but see supra ). Euripian theorodokoi hosted theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 15 ( 356 / 5 ); cf. SEG 35 306 ) and from Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .A. 28 -30 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). The Pegasos-type staters with an Ε assigned to Echinos (no. 118 ) may have been coins of Euripos as well."
120,Herakleia,Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,38.55,20.55,232,1117,"120 . Herakleia Map 54 . Lat. 38 . 55 , long. 20 . 55 ? The location of Herakleia is unknown, pace Barr . map 54 , Pritchett suggests the area of Vonitsa (( 1992 ) 2 -3 , 97 -101 ; cf. SEG 42 379 ), but the question has to remain open.Thus,there are no identifiable ruins to show that Herakleia had an urban centre; nor is Herakleia mentioned in the theorodokoi lists. Type: C. The toponym is ' Εράκλεα ( SEG 1 94 ; cf. LSAG ² 127 -28 , 131 no. 13 (C7 -C6 )) or ' Ηράκλεια (Steph. Byz. 303 . 16 , 304 . 2 ). Herakleia is not mentioned as a polis in the ancient sources. Pliny records it under Acarnaniae . . . oppida ( HN 4 . 5 ). Because of the Corinthian interests in the region, the inscription on the golden phiale of C7 -C6found in Olympia ( SEG 1 94 ; cf. supra ) is connected with Pliny's Heraclia by Pritchett ( 1992 ) 100 -1 , contra L. Antonelli; cf. SEG 45 404 . Coins of C5s with the legend ΗΡΑΚΛΕΩΤΩΝ or monograms attributed by Imhoof-Blumer ( 1878 ) 101 -12 to the Akarnanian Herakleia may have been struck by another Herakleia (cf. Head, HN ² 328 -34 ; Rhomaios ( 1918 ) 115 ). SNG Cop. Acarnania 325 ."
121,Hyporeiai (Hyporeates),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,,,227,1034,"121 . Hyporeiai (Hyporeates) Map. 54 . Unlocated, not in Barr . Type: C. The toponym is ' Υπώρειαι ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 35 ( 356 / 5 )). The ethnic is ' Υπωρεά ( της ) ( IG ix² . 1 587 . 3 (C4 ); cf. SEG 39 281 ). On the location, see Pritchett ( 1992 ) 79 n. 1 : 'L. Robert, Hellenica 1 ( 1940 ) 106 -108 , has shown . . . that it [sc. Hyporeiai] was an Akarnanian town and he suggests from its position that it was in eastern Akarnania on the Aitolian frontier 'au pied des monts' .' Hyporeiai is attested only twice: as a toponym in an Epidaurian theorodokoi list, and on an Athenian grave stele from the Piraeus (both cited above). Since the deceased of IG ix² . 1 587 is called Ακαρνάν ' Υπωρεά ( της ) (Robert ( 1940 ) 106 -8 ), Hyporeiai must have been a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy in C4 . So it may have been a polis (cf. loc. cit .), although an έθνος (cf. Habicht ( 1957 ) 109 -10 ) cannot be excluded. A theorodokos to host theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ) is attested for 356 / 5 ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 35 ( 356 / 5 ))."
122,Ithaka (Ithakesios),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,38.25,20.4,846,4111,"122 . Ithaka (Ithakesios) Map 54 . Lat. 38 . 25 , long. 20 . 40 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is ' Ιθάκα , ηasper ( I.Magnesia 35 . 37 = Rigsby ( 1996 ) 212 -14 no. 85 ( c. 207 )) or ' Ιθάκη (Ps.-Skylax 34 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ιθακήσιος (Bacchyl. fr. 29 ; Eur. Cyc . 277 ; Arist. Ithac. Pol . fr. 511 ) or /acuteΙθακος ( I.Magnesia 36 . 4 , 27 ; this form of the ethnic is also found on coins ( infra ) but is otherwise confined to poetry and to Odysseus, e.g. Eur. Cycl . 103 ). Ithaka is attested as a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 34 and in the political sense by Eur. Cyc . 276 (but in a mythical context). The earliest epigraphical attestation of the political sense is in an Ithakan decree from Magnesia ( I.Magnesia 36 . 4 , 27 ( c. 207 )). Polis status in C6may be inferred from the cult of the goddess Athena Polias ( IG ix² . 1 1614 (C6 ), contra Cole ( 1995 ) 301 -4 . Ithaka is included among the Aristotelian politeiai (Arist. frr. 509 -14 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Aristotelian ' Ιθακησίων πολιτεία (no. 68 , Gigon) and internally on the coins (see infra ). The name of the island is ' Ιθάκη (Hom. Il . 2 . 632 ; Od . 1 . 18 ). It is identical with that of the city and the territory (Ps.Skylax 34 ). The place Αλαλκο µ εναί called ηasper τῶν ' Ιθακησίων πόλις (Plut. Mor . 301 D) or πόλις εν ' Ιθάκηsubiotaη τηsubiotaηtilde νήσΩsubiotaω (Steph.Byz. 75 . 14 ) is commonly identified with the site at the Aëtos mountain (Partsch ( 1890 ) 57 -58 ; Strauch ( 1996 b )), but it seems to be a mythological fiction (Wirbelauer ( 1998 ) 248 -51 ). Other toponyms on Ithaka attested in ancient sources derive from the Odyssey . The island is situated near Kephallenia (Strabo 10 . 2 . 11 -12 ; Steph. Byz. 328 . 12 ; cf. Strabo 8 . 2 . 2 ). From the fact that Kephallenian cities were members of the Second Athenian Naval League, Dreher ( 1995 b ) 191 , 199 , infers Ithakan membership of the League too. The only psaphisma of Ithaka known to us is the inscription from Magnesia on the Maeander ( I.Magnesia 36 . 29 ( c. 207 )). There was a sanctuary of Athena Polias and Hera Teleia ( IG ix² . 1 1614 (C6 ); cf. I.Magnesia 36 . 30 ) and a cave sanctuary at the Polis bay (Benton ( 1934 -35 ), ( 1938 -39 ); Steinhart and Wirbelauer ( 2002 ) 334 -35 , Mycenaean to Roman times) with dedications, particularly to the Nymphs and to Herakles and Odysseus. The veneration of Athena and Odysseus is also attested on some coins (Head, HN ² 428 (C4 -C3 )). A sanctuary and temple of Apollo were situated in the saddle east of the Aëtos mountain (Symeonoglou, Prakt ( 1986 ) 236 -37 , pl. 104 a; cf. SEG 38 432 (C6 -C3 ) and IG ix² . 1 1685 ). The existence of a stadion is to be concluded from the mention of the games called Odysseia in I.Magnesia 36 . 16 . The settlement in the saddle east of Aëtos,presumably the urban centre of Ithaka, had a fortified acropolis on the summit of the mountain and polygonal city walls (C5 -C4 ; sketch map: Heurtley and Lorimer ( 1932 -33 ) pl. 1 ; renewed: Symeonoglou, Prakt ( 1985 ) 202 ; cf. especially Kilian ( 1975 )) and several buildings (Symeonoglou, Prakt ( 1984 ff); Ergon ( 1984 ff); Steinhart and Wirbelauer ( 2002 ) 331 ; Randsborg ( 2002 ) 1 . 109 , 2 . 282 -83 ). The city walls enclose an area of c. 12 ha. A harbour ( λι µ ήν ) is recorded by Ps.-Skylax 34 . There are other remains of polygonal walls scattered on various sites in the northern part of the island. The eponym of Ithaka was Ithakos (Hom. Od. 17 . 207 ), brother of Neritos and son of Pterelaos (Akousilaos ( FGrHist 2 ) fr. 43 ), cf. Wirbelauer ( 1998 ) 280 -83 . The patron deity of Ithaka was Athena Polias ( IG ix² . 1 1614 (C6 ); cf. SEG 27 180 ; LSAG ² 231 no. 3 ). There was a festival called Odysseia at least in the Heltic period ( I.Magnesia 36 . 16 ). Ithaka struck bronze coins from C4 to C2 . Types: obv . head of Athena or Odysseus; rev . fulmen in olive wreath, or Odysseus, or cock; legend: ΙΘΑ , ΙΘΑΚΩΝ (Postolakas ( 1868 ) 90 ; Head, HN ² 428 ; Grose ( 1926 ) nos. 6697 -99 ; SNG Cop.

123,Korkyra (Korkyraios),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,39.35,19.55,3296,15009,"123 . Korkyra (Korkyraios) Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 35 , long. 19 . 55 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A. The toponym is Κορκουacute [ ρα ] (Korinna col. ii . 36 , Campbell), Κόρκυρα , ηasper ( IG i³ 364 . 1 , 7 = ML 61 ( 433 / 2 ); IG iv² . 1 95 . 28 ( 356 / 5 )) or Κέρκυρα ( IG ii² 5224 . 2 = CEG 469 (C4f); Hdt. 7 . 145 . 2 ; Thuc. 3 . 70 . 3 ). The name of the island is the same as that of the polis (Ps.-Skylax 29 ). The city-ethnic is /Koppaορ/Koppaυραῖος ( F.Delphes iii . 4 454 = LSAG ² 233 and 234 no. 15 ( c. 500 -475 ); cf. SEG 31 546 , 547 ), Κορκυραῖος ( IG ii² 97 ( 375 ); on coins, cf. Head, HN ² 327 (C4 )) or Κερκυραῖος ( Agora xvii 517 (C5 -C4 )), which is the only form attested in literary sources (Hdt. 7 . 15 . 3 ; Thuc. 3 . 70 . 1 ). ⁶ Korkyra is called a polis both in the urban sense (Thuc. 3 . 72 . 3 , 74 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 17 , 24 ; Ps.-Skylax 29 ) and in the political sense (Thuc. 1 . 55 . 1 , 3 . 70 . 1 ; Dem. 24 . 202 ). The territorial sense is a connotation at Thuc. 1 . 37 . 3 . The citizen of Korkyra is called polites by Thuc. 3 . 70 . 2 and Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 22 , and the polis was included among the Aristotelian politeiai (fr. 517 . 1 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in different inscriptions (e.g. IG ii² 97 ( 375 )) and in Classical authors (e.g. Hdt. 7 . 154 . 3 ; Thuc. 1 . 32 . 2 ), and internally on coins (Head, HN ² 327 (C4 )). The individual use of the cityethnic is attested externally in Delphi ( CID ii 5 .I. 2 ( 359 / 8 )) and Athens ( IG ii² 9010 (C4s)). It is called patris in IG ii² 5224 , an inscription which is dated to c. 375 on formal grounds; however, the grave associated with the stele seems to date to the third quarter of C5 ; the stele was presumably erected in 375 when Korkyra joined the Second Athenian Naval Confederacy (cf. IG ii² 96 ); see Knigge ( 1972 ) and ( 1988 ) 99 -100 . The name of the territory is Κερκυραία (Thuc. 1 . 30 . 1 ) or Κορκυραία (Strabo 7 . 75 ). Κερκυραία (Strabo 7 fr. 6 ) as the name of the peraia around Buthroton is supposed by Bürchner ( 1922 ) 1401 , 1417 (cf. Thuc. 3 . 85 . 2 ; Strauch ( 1997 ) ⁶ Attic inscriptions of C5 /C4 use both forms ( Κερκ . . . , Κορκ . . .), while in Heltic and Roman times Κορκ . . . is preferred. Outside Attika, the epigraphical evidence usually has Κορκ . . . (exception: SEG 31 548 -50 (Delphi, C5 -C3 ), but cf. the note of the SEG editor on Vatin's readings; SEG 25 354 (Sikyon, n. d.)). Therefore, editors (at least those of non-Attic inscriptions) should avoid restoring Κερκ . . . without special arguments (e.g. in I.Didyma 214 A. ii . 11 (C1 ), the restoration [ Κορ ] κυραῖος seems preferable), cf. now Hallof in IG ix² . 1 4 p. 1 . 227 ). The island of Ptychia mentioned by Thuc. 4 . 46 . 3 has been identified with the modern island of Vido (Bürchner ( 1922 ) 1411 -12 no. 9 ; Dontas ( 1965 ) 139 -40 n. 3 ). The mountain ' Ιστώνη had a τεῖχος / τείχισ µ α held by the oligarchs in 427 -425 with 600 men (Thuc. 3 . 85 . 4 , 4 . 2 . 3 , 46 . 2 ). On the north coast of the island lay a town named Kassiope with a port and a temple of Zeus Kasios (Adler ( 1919 ) 2267 ; Bürchner ( 1919 ), ( 1922 ) 1413 no. 13 ; Schwabl ( 1972 ) 320 -21 , see also SEG 23 395 ). The position of Korkyra was excellent for the traffic between Greece and Italy (Thuc. 1 . 36 . 2 , 44 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 9 ; cf. Partsch ( 1887 ) 57 ; Kiechle ( 1979 ); Thiry ( 2001 ) 139 -40 ). For the foundation of Korkyra we have two different traditions. Strabo 6 . 2 . 4 says that it was founded in the same year as Syracuse (no. 47 ), i.e. traditionally in 733 ; Euseb. Chron . (translated by Jerome), however, gives the year 706 , which better fits the archaeological evidence (cf. Coldstream ( 1977 ) 185 ; Kalligas ( 1984 ); De Fidio ( 1995 ) 90 -94 ; Lang ( 1996 ) 301 ). The metropolis was Corinth (no. 227 ) (Hdt. 3 . 49 . 1 ; Thuc. 1 . 25 . 3 , 38 . 1 ; cf. Corinth viii . 3 23 = SEG 28 380 (C4 )), but we hear also of Eretrians (no. 370 ) from Euboia as colonists before the Corinthians (Plut. Mor . 293 AB; for a discussion, see Kalligas ( 1984 ); De Fidio ( 1995 ) 64 -65 ; Parker ( 1997 ) 55 -57 ). The oecist was the Bacchiad (Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 80 ; schol. Ap. Rhod. 4 . 1212 -14 , 1216 ) Chersikrates from Corinth (Strabo 6 . 2 . 4 ). Perhaps the inscription Χερσικρατιδαtildeν πατρωισταtildeν (Klaffenbach ( 1940 ) 164 -65 no. 3 ) is related to a cult for Chersikrates as heros ktistes . The mythical eponym is Korkyra, daughter of Asopos (Korinna, PMG 645 col. iii . 21 ; schol. Pind. Ol . 6 . 144 ; Diod. 4 . 72 . 1 ; Paus. 5 . 22 . 6 ). The foreign relations of Korkyra are amply attested. The Korkyraians concluded an επι µ αχία with Athens (no. 361 ) in 433 (Thuc. 1 . 144 . 1 -2 ; Staatsverträge 161 ) and an alliance in 427 (Thuc. 3 . 75 . 1 ; Staatsverträge 172 ). In 375 , Korkyra became a member of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 96 -97 = Staatsverträge 262 -63 ; Dreher ( 1995 a ) 13 -14 ; contra : Cargill ( 1981 ) 68 ff) and, in 340 or later, a member of the Hellenic League against Philip II (Dem. 18 . 237 ; Staatsverträge 343 ; cf. CEG ii 809 ). For C4 (C3 : Parke), a sympoliteia with the Orikioi (no. 103 ) is attested (Parke ( 1967 ) 261 no. 6 = SEG 23 474 ; for further information, see Strauch ( 1997 ) 227 n. 72 ). The Korkyraians were involved in the following wars and engagements. In C7 ( 664 ?), Korkyra and Corinth (no. 227 ) fought the first naval battle in Greek history, as far as Thucydides knew ( 1 . 13 . 4 ). About 600 , the Arniad Charops (not Arniadas,cf. SEG 36 541 ) was killed in a naval campaign on the river Arachthus ( CEG i 145 ; Hammond ( 1967 ) 493 ; Andreou ( 1991 ) 436 -38 ). Before the Persian wars, the Korkyraian fleet was among the best in Greece (Thuc. 1 . 14 . 2 ; Kiechle ( 1979 ) 175 ). Sixty ships were sent to Salamis, but remained in western waters (Hdt. 7 . 168 . 3 ). Before the Peloponnesian War, the Korkyraian navy was the second largest in Hellas, surpassed only by the Athenian (Thuc. 1 . 33 . 1 ). Korkyra could muster 110 ships against the Corinthians, of which about seventy were lost in the battle of Sybota (in 433 , Thuc. 1 . 47 . 1 , 54 . 2 ). In 373 / 2 , the Spartans under Mnasippos besieged Korkyra without success (Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 3 -26 ). In 345 / 4 , two Korkyraian ships joined Timoleon (Plut. Tim. 8 . 5 ). Three strategoi (Mikiades, Aisimides and Eurybatos) are attested as commanding the fleet in 433 (Thuc. 1 . 47 . 1 , 48 . 3 ). Korkyraian envoys were sent to Athens in 433 (Thuc. 1 . 31 . 2 -44 ), in 427 (Thuc. 3 . 71 . 2 ) and in 375 ( IG ii² 96 ). The envoys Thersandros and Simylos died in Athens ( IG ii² 5224 = CEG ii 469 (C4f, r 433 / 2 ?); cf. Knigge ( 1988 ) 99 -100 ). Before the Heltic period, Korkyra gave proxenia to Menekrates of Oiantheia (no. 166 ) ( CEG i 143 ( 625 -600 ?); but cf. SEG 44 441 and Nomima i 34 ( c. 550 )) and to some Corinthians (Thuc. 3 . 70 . 1 ), and Korkyraians were granted proxenia in Delphi (no. 177 ) ( SEG 31 534 (C4 ); F.Delphes iii . 4 406 . 2 -4 (C4 -C3 ); for proxenoi of Delphi, cf. Empereur ( 1981 ) 418 ). Theorodokoi were appointed in Korkyra to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) ( SEG 23 189 . i . 13 ( 330 -324 ); cf. Cabanes ( 1969 ) 551 ; SEG 26 427 and 36 337 ), Delphi (no. 177 ) ( F.Delphes iii . 4 406 . 2 -4 (C4 -C3 )), Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 28 ( 356 / 5 )) and Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .B. 6 -7 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). Several Korkyraian Olympionikai are attested ( 111 , 118 , 155 (?), 161 , 168 , 409 ? (C6 -C4 )). The famous bronze bull in Delphi was a communal dedication of the Korkyraians (Paus. 10 . 9 . 3 -4 ; F.Delphes iii . 1 2 ( c. 480 ); cf. LSAG ² 113 no. 13 ; F.Delphes iii . 4 454 = LSAG ² 233 and 234 no. 15 ( c. 500 -475 ); cf. Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 103 -4 no. 104 ; Jacquemin ( 1999 ) 64 -65 , 320 no. 122 ). Another bronze bull was dedicated at Olympia (Paus. 5 . 27 . 9 ). In C7 -C6 , Korkyra was under the rule of the Corinthian tyrant Periander (Hdt. 3 . 52 . 6 ). During the Archidamian War, there was a stasis between democrats and oligarchs (Thuc. 3 . 70 -85 ; Diod. 12 . 57 , 13 . 48 ; cf. Gehrke, Stasis 88 -93 ). Thereafter, Korkyra was democratic (for 375 , see IG ii² 96 = Staatsverträge 262 ; IG ii² 97 = Staatsverträge 263 ), but suffered from civil strife several times: in 411 / 10 (Diod. 13 . 48 . 5 ff), in 375 / 4 (Diod. 15 . 46 . 2 , 47 . 1 ) and in 361 , when the oligarchs came to power once again (Aen. Tact. 11 . 15 ). The oldest public enactment (C7 ) is attested indirectly by proxeny given by the damos to Menekrates of Oiantheia (no. 166 ) ( CEG i 143 . 3 ). Nomoi are mentioned by Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 64 , 375 . A law court can be inferred from Thuc. 3 . 70 . 3 . The eponymous magistrate was a prytanis ( IG ix² . 1 786 . 1 (C4 )), together with whom synarchoi are mentioned (Klaffenbach ( 1940 ) 163 no. 1 (C4 )). A boule and bouleutai are attested by Thuc. 3 . 70 . 5 -6 . Explicitly, the term halia does not occur earlier than in Heltic inscriptions (e.g. IG ix² . 1 786 . 5 (C4 )). But since we know of decisions of the Korkyraian people before that date ( CEG i 143 . 3 , 5 -6 ; Thuc. 3 . 71 . 2 ), we have to conclude that the halia had existed since the Archaic period. From inscribed lead tablets found at Palaiopolis ( c. 500 ) we are informed about the Korkyraian system of civic subdivisions (Kalligas ( 1971 ); cf. Jones, POAG 159 -61 ; Hadzis ( 1993 ); Nomima ii 73 ), a combination of proper names given in gen.pl./sing.with a feminine ordinal adjective.A different kind of civic subdivision is attested in the form of a subethnic on the back of one of the tablets: Ευacuteρυλλος Α µ φινευacuteς ( SEG 41 543 ). Two members of the Dorian phyle Hylleis are recorded in IG ix² . 1 798 . 3 , 5 (C2 ); cf. SEG 25 609 ; Kalligas ( 1971 ) 87 ). The acropolis (Thuc. 3 . 72 . 3 ) was situated in the southern part of the city (Bürchner ( 1922 ) 1411 ).A τεῖχος with πυacuteργοι is mentioned by Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 15 , 17 , 20 ( 373 / 2 ). Whether the remains of a wall with gates and towers between the ports of Hyllos and Alkinoos can be identified with Xenophon's τεῖχος is a matter of discussion; for: Schmidt ( 1890 ) 46 and pl. II; Spetsieris-Choremis ( 1997 ) 12 (C5 -C4 ); against: Kaletsch in Lauffer ( 1989 ) 503 , who dates this wall to the Heltic period. Archaeological evidence for the urban structure is reported by Lang ( 1996 ) 299 -301 . The most important public buildings were the bouleuterion (Thuc. 3 . 70 . 6 : ες τηgraveν βουλήν ) and the prytaneion ( I.Magnesia 44 . 40 , 42 ( c. 207 )). The agora, where in C5most of the oligarchs lived (Thuc. 3 . 72 . 3 ), was situated in the northern part of the city near the northern harbour (Thuc. 3 . 72 . 3 , 74 . 2 ). A νεώριον is attested by Thuc. 3 . 74 . 2 (cf. ναώριον : SEG 13 384 . 10 , 11 (C2 )), who likewise mentions two Korkyraian ports ( 3 . 72 . 3 ), the ' Υλλαϊκός ( ' Υλλικός , Apoll. Rhod. 4 . 1125 ) or /asperacuteΥλλου (schol. Dionys. Per. 493 = GGM ii . 450 ) λι µ ήν , and the λι µ ηgraveν οasper προgraveς αυτηsubiotaηtilde [ sc . τηsubiotaηtilde αγορΩsubiotaαtilde ] καιgrave προgraveς τηgraveν ήπειρον (commonly identified with the Αλκίνου λι µ ήν , schol. Dionys. Per. 493 ). Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 36 has only one λι µ ήν τῶν Κερκυραίων . According to Ps.-Skylax 29 , Korkyra had three good harbours near the city,but the identification of the third remains doubtful. The patron deity of Korkyra was Apollo Korkyraios (Kalligas ( 1968 ) 313 = LSAG ² 453 no.A (C5 )). On his cult, see also Kalligas ( 1969 a ) 54 -58 ; ( 1968 ) 304 -13 (C6 and later). Sanctuaries for the following deities are attested: Artemis (Rodenwaldt ( 1939 ); Schleif et al . ( 1940 ); Riemann ( 1943 ) (C6 ); votive inscriptions: Klaffenbach ( 1940 ) 163 -64 no. 1 (C4 ); no. 2 (C3 )); Apollo Pythios (Klaffenbach ( 1940 ) 165 -66 no. 5 = LSAG ² 234 no. 17 (C5 )); Hera Akr(a)ia ( IG ix . 1 698 = LSAG ² 234 no. 18 (C5 ), identified by Dontas ( 1965 ), ( 1976 ), and Kalligas ( 1969 a ) 51 , 53 , with one of the three temples known in the Mon Repos area; for the Heraion near the polis , see Thuc. 3 . 81 . 2 ); the Dioskouroi (Thuc. 3 . 75 . 3 ; for a horos ∆ιοσκουacuteρων found near the Menekrates monument, see IG ix² . 1 883 . ii (C4 )); Dionysos (Thuc. 3 . 81 . 5 ; for traces of a possible cult place, see Cremer ( 1981 ); Lang ( 1996 ) 299 -300 ). There was a temenos of Zeus (Thuc. 3 . 70 . 4 ; for the cults of Zeus in Korkyra, see Schwabl ( 1972 ) 336 no. 9 ( 337 ); ( 1978 ) 1477 ) and one of the heros Alkinoos (Thuc. 3 . 70 . 4 ). Outside the city, a temple of Zeus Kasios existed in Kassiope (see supra ) and one of Artemis in the southern part of the Kanopi peninsula (Lang ( 1996 ) 299 no. 540 ). The Korkyraians used the Dorian calendar of Corinth (no. 227 ) (Bischoff ( 1919 ) 1592 no. 31 ; Hadzis ( 1995 )). The oracle of Dodona was consulted by the Korkyraians in C5 (Parke ( 1967 ) 260 nos. 2 , 3 ), and in C4 (C3 : Parke) together with the Orikioi (no. 103 ) (ibid. 261 no. 6 = SEG 23 474 ). In Delphi, Korkyra held the promanteia ( F.Delphes iii . 4 389 (C4 ); cf. Vatin ( 1981 ) 445 ; SEG 31 555 ). In about 627 , Epidamnos (no. 79 ) was founded by Korkyraians together with Corinthian and other Dorian settlers (Thuc. 1 . 24 . 2 ; Diod. 12 . 30 . 2 ; cf. Gomme ( 1945 -81 ) i. 159 ; Gehrke, Stasis 60 -61 n. 4 ). According to Strabo 7 . 5 . 8 , Apollonia (no. 77 ) was a κτίσ µ α Κορινθίων καιgrave Κερκυραίων , and Korkyra participated probably in the colonisation of Leukas (no. 126 ; together with Corinth (no. 227 ), Plut. Them . 24 . 1 , from Theophrastos; Frost ( 1980 ) 201 -2 ). Anaktorion (no. 114 ) is recorded as a place common to Korkyraians and Corinthians before 432 (Thuc. 1 . 55 . 1 ), which may suggest that it was a shared foundation too (but see supra 356 ). Kiechle ( 1979 ) 179 supports the hypothesis that Korkyra was involved in the colonisation of the Dalmatian island of Melaina Korkyra (no. 83 ) carried out by the Knidians (no. 903 ). During C6 -C4 , Korkyra struck coins (silver and bronze) following local tradition in both standard and design. Silver denominations: stater, drachm, triobol, diobol, obol. Types: obv . often cow (suckling calf) or amphora; rev . often stellate or floral pattern; legend: the Archaic coins are anepigraphic, but from about 450 onward, they are generally inscribed ΚΟΡ . After 338 , Korkyra began to strike staters similar to those of Corinth but with the legends ΚΟΡ , ΚΟΡΚΥΡΑΙΩΝ or Κ . A few have been found in hoards from Sicily and Magna Graecia (Talbert ( 1971 ) 61 ; Taliercio Mensitieri and Spagnoli ( 1993 ) especially pls. 3 , 5 h). IG i³ 383 . 91 -93 ( 429 / 8 ) mentions Korkyraioi stateres (cf. Regling ( 1929 ) 2175 ).

124,Koronta (Korontaios),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,38.35,21.1,533,2508,"124 . Koronta (Korontaios) Map 54 . Lat. 38 . 35 , long. 21 . 10 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: B. The toponym is Κόροντα , τά (Thuc. 2 . 102 . 1 ) or Κορόνται , αιasper ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 12 ( 356 / 5 ); SEG 36 331 .A. 49 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). The city-ethnic is Κορονταῖος ( IG ix² . 1 583 . 6 ( 216 ), 582 . 2 ( c. 207 )). Koronta is not explicitly attested as a polis but named together with Stratos (no. 138 ) καιgrave άλλων χωρίων ( sc . of Akarnania) by Thuc. 2 . 102 . 1 . Since it was a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy, struck coins in C4 -C3 and had a walled urban centre (with the highest degree of probability the site near modern Chrysovitsa: Pritchett ( 1992 ) 102 -3 ; Schoch ( 1997 ) 43 -44 ), it is to be classified as a polis of type B. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form ( Κ ( infra ) or ΚΟ on coins (see s.v. Torybeia (no. 140 )). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Heltic inscriptions (see supra ). Koronta was part of Akarnania ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 8 + 12 ( 356 / 5 ); SEG 36 331 .A. 15 + 49 ( 331 / 30 -313 )), lying in the mesogeia (Thuc. 2 . 102 . 1 ). From the account of Thucydides (especially 2 . 102 . 1 ) we have to conclude that Koronta belonged to the Akarnanian Confederacy already in C5 . It is explicitly attested as a member in C3 ( IG ix² . 1 583 , 582 ). In 429 , a group of citizens loyal to the Peloponnesians was exiled by the Athenians (Thuc. 2 . 102 . 1 ). Theorodokoi are attested in Koronta to host theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ; IG iv² . 1 95 . 12 ( 356 / 5 )) and Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .A. 49 -51 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). The walls of the presumed site of Koronta near Chrysovitsa were built of polygonal and horizontal masonry (Pritchett ( 1992 ) 103 with pls. 77 -81 ). Kirsten dated them to the Heltic period (Philippson and Kirsten ( 1958 ) 635 n. 15 ), but given the well-founded general observations by Pritchett (( 1992 ) 115 ff), an earlier date seems preferable. A Pegasos-type stater of Corinthian standard has been attributed to Koronta. Obv . Pegasos; rev . head of Athena with Makedonian shield; legend: K (Imhoof-Blumer ( 1878 ) 114 ; Head, HN ² 329 ). Since then, eight coins of this type have been found in Sicilian and South Italian hoards (Talbert ( 1971 ) 61 ; IGCH 88 , 2030 , 2180 , 2185 , 2187 , 2198 ; Taliercio Mensitieri and Spagnoli ( 1993 ) especially pls. 1 , 3 ); this coinage can be dated to C4s. For other coins, see Torybeia (no. 140 ); SNG Cop.Acarnania 323 ."
125,Kranioi (Kranios),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,38.1,20.3,924,4414,"125 . Kranioi (Kranios) Map 54 . Lat. 38 . 10 , long. 20 . 30 . Size of territory: 2 or 3 . Type: A. The toponym is Κράνιοι (Thuc. 5 . 35 . 7 ; IG ix . 1 276 . 3 (Opous, C3 -C2 ?)) or Κράναια (schol. Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 , Hude). The city-ethnic is Κράνιος (Thuc. 2 . 30 . 2 , 33 . 3 ; I.Magnesia 35 . 39 ( c. 207 )) or Κράνειος ( Etym. Magn . 507 . 31 ). Kranioi is referred to as a polis in the urban sense by the term τετράπολις at Thuc. 2 . 30 . 2 , where the use of city-ethnics instead of toponyms indicates that the political sense is a connotation (Hansen ( 2000 ) 174 n. 3 and 208 ); cf. Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 33 : ταgraveς εν τηsubiotaηtilde ΚεφαλληνίΩsubiotaα πόλεις . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Heltic inscriptions ( I.Magnesia 35 . 39 ( c. 207 ); IG ix . 1 276 . 3 (Opous, C3 -C2 ?)) and by Thuc. 2 . 30 . 2 , 33 . 2 , and internally in various abbreviations, on C5 -C4 coins (see infra ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in an honorific decree from Delphi ( F.Delphes iii . 3 204 . 3 ( 162 / 1 ?)). The name of the territory is given by Thuc. 2 . 33 . 3 as ηasper Κρανίων γηtilde . It included the southern part of the island of Kephallenia without the peninsula to the west (cf.Paleis (no. 132 )). The eponym of the island was the hero Kephalos, son of Deion(eus) and father of Pronos, Samos, Peleus and Kranios, the eponyms of the four Kephallenian poleis (Gehrke ( 1994 ) 110 -12 ; Wirbelauer ( 1998 ) 269 -80 ). In 431 , an Athenian envoy was sent to Kephallenia to ascertain the Kephallenian views on the growing conflict (Thuc. 2 . 7 . 3 ; Diod. 12 . 43 . 5 ). The Corinthian aggression in the winter of 431 / 30 (Thuc. 2 . 33 . 3 ) indicates that Kranioi was pro-Athenian; its inhabitants may have been among the Kephallenians who supplied ships to the Athenians under Demosthenes during the campaign in 426 (Thuc. 3 . 94 -98 ) and hoplites in 413 (Thuc. 7 . 31 . 2 ). In 421 the Athenians settled Messenians and other people from the Peloponnesos in Kranioi (Thuc. 5 . 35 . 7 ). They were expelled by the Spartans in 401 (Diod. 14 . 34 . 2 -3 ). In 373 / 2 the Kranioi may have been among the Kephallenians who became members of the Second Athenian Naval League ( Staatsverträge 262 and 267 = Agora xvi 46 ; Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 33 , 37 ; cf. Dreher ( 1995 b ) 191 , 199 ) and of the Corinthian League of 338 / 7 ( Staatsverträge 403 ). The Argive theorodokoi list SEG 23 189 . i . 20 ( 330 -324 ) mentions Kephallenia; so at least one of the four Kephallenian poleis appointed theorodokoi to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ). Archontes as judges in one city of Kephallenia (probably Kranioi or Paleis (no. 132 ): Wirbelauer ( 1998 ) 341 -42 ) are attested by Dem. 32 . 9 ; cf. 14 , 22 -23 . A sanctuary of Demeter and Kore is mentioned in a late inscription (Kalligas ( 1978 ); SEG 30 517 (C1 )). Whether the foundations with orthostats on the acropolis belong to this temple or to another one has to remain open (cf. Kalligas ( 1969 b ) 270 -72 ). A rural sanctuary of C6 was discovered at Minies; its remains are now covered or destroyed by the modern airport (Kalligas ( 1973 ) 83 -84 ; Randsborg ( 1995 ) 97 ). The acropolis is situated on the top of the hill in the south-western part of the settlement (Kalligas ( 1969 b ) 270 -72 ). Polygonal and ashlar walls exist on three sides of the town, and there are two other stretches connecting the main wall with the plain of Kútavos, probably the ancient harbour of Kranioi (for Mycenaean remains and those of C5 -C4 , see Partsch ( 1890 ) 80 -84 with pl. 2 ; Benton ( 1932 ) 224 -25 ; Kalligas ( 1969 b ) 272 , ( 1978 ) 137 ; Steinhart and Wirbelauer ( 2002 ) 333 ; Randsborg ( 2002 ) i. 106 -8 , ii. 275 -81 , 299 -307 ). According to Kraay ( 1976 ) 96 , the Kranioi were the first Kephallenians to strike coins: silver coins of C5 -C4 . Denominations: triobol, trihemiobol, obol. Types: obv . mostly ram's head; rev . bow, often in incuse square; legend: ΚΡ , ΚΡΑ , ΚΡΑΝΙ . Bronze coins were issued from C5 onward.Types: obv . head of ram or of bull,male figure,identified by head with Kephalos, the mythical eponym; rev . head of Kephalos; legend: ΚΡΑ , ΚΡ , Κ or Η , monograms (Babelon, Traité ii. 1 no. 1229 : ΚΕΦΑ ; see Postolakas ( 1868 ) 91 -94 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 1 . 907 -10 ; 2 . 791 -96 ; Head, HN ² 427 , and cf.

126,Leukas (Leukadios),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,38.5,20.45,1867,8801,"12 6. Leukas (Leukadios) Map 54 . Lat. 38 . 50 , long. 20 . 45 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Λευκάς , ηasper (Thuc. 3 . 94 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 3 ; IG iv² . 1 95 . 20 ( 356 / 5 )). The city-ethnic is Λευκάδιος (Hdt. 8 . 45 ; Thuc. 3 . 94 . 2 ; ML 27 . 10 ( 479 ); IG ii² 104 = Staatsverträge 278 ( 368 )). According to Ps.-Skylax 34 , the polis of Leukas was called ' Επιλευκάδιοι in earlier times. This name of a πόλις µ εταgrave Ακαρνανίαν is known also to Steph. Byz. 274 . 11 (from Hecat. fr. 110 ). Leukas is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 34 and in the political sense by Thuc. 1 . 30 . 3 . At Thuc. 3 . 94 . 2 polis is used in the urban and political senses simultaneously. It was included among the Aristotelian politeiai (no. 101 , Gigon); for the use of politeia in connection with Leukas, cf. Arist. loc. cit .). At Hecat. fr. 102 c = Strabo 6 . 2 . 4 we cannot be certain that the term polis stems from Hekataios. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally on the Serpent Column from Delphi (ML 27 . 10 ) and in Hdt. 8 . 45 and Thuc. 3 . 94 . 2 ; internally it is found on C5 -C4 coins ( ΛΕΥΚΑ∆ΙΩΝ and various abbreviations). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in several inscriptions (e.g. IAEpi 14 (Epidauros, C4 -C3 )) and by Hdt. 9 . 38 . 2 . The polis of Leukas (Ps.-Skylax 34 ) was situated on the island of the same name (Harp.s.v.),which was also, qua territory, called Λευκαδία (Thuc. 3 . 94 . 1 ). To the north and north-east, the Leukadians bordered on the Thesprotians (Hdt. 8 . 47 ).An isthmus with an artificial channel ( dioryktos ) connected the northern part of the island with the mainland (Strabo 10 . 2 . 8 ; cf. Partsch ( 1889 ) 2 -7 ; ( 1907 ), Fiedler ( 1996 ) 159 ). A part of the mainland opposite was, as peraia , under Leukadian control (Thuc. 3 . 94 . 2 ). Part of this peraia may have been the fortified place Nerikos (Thuc. 3 . 7 . 4 ; Strabo 10 . 2 . 8 ), which can be identified tentatively with the ruins near Ag. Georgios (dominating the southern entrance into the Leukas channel), as suggested by Fiedler (( 1996 ) 159 -60 , 162 ) and others. Other place-names attested for Leukas island are Ellomenon (Thuc. 3 . 94 . 1 ) and Phara (Ps.-Skylax 34 ); in all probability, they were dependent settlements; they cannot be located with certainty (for the proposals, see Fiedler ( 1996 ) 159 -60 and s.v. Palairos (no. 131 )). There are various remains on the island (see in general Fiedler ( 1996 ) 161 -68 ), among them a Doric temple at Agios Ioannis Rodakis (Dörpfeld ( 1927 ) 263 -64 ). Leukas was founded during the reign of the tyrant Kypselos (Strabo 10 . 2 . 8 , for the date ( 657 / 6 -627 / 6 ), see Gehrke ( 1990 ) 34 ; Oberhummer ( 1887 ) 76 proposed c. 635 ) by Corinthians (no. 227 ) (e.g. Hdt. 8 . 45 ; Thuc. 1 . 30 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 34 ; Dem. 9 . 34 .). New settlers arrived in the time of his successor Periander (Plut. Mor . 552 E). The oecist was Pylades (Nic. Dam.( FGrHist 90 ) fr. 57 . 7 ), and the colonists were sent out by Kypselos and his son Gorgos (Strabo 10 . 2 . 8 ). According to the Alkmaionis (fr. 5 , Bernabé; Ephor. fr. 124 = Strabo 10 . 2 . 9 ), Leukadios, son of Ikarios, Penelope's father, was the eponym of Leukas. Leukas was a member of the following leagues: Hellenic League of 481 (ML 27 . 10 ; Hdt. 8 . 45 et passim ; Staatsverträge 130 ), Peloponnesian League (Thuc. 2 . 9 . 3 ; Diod. 12 . 42 . 4 (r 431 ); Paus. 10 . 9 . 10 (r 405 )), Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 104 = Staatsverträge 278 ( 368 ); cf. Dreher ( 1995 b ) 191 with n. 122 ), Hellenic League against Philip II (Dem. 18 . 237 ; Aeschin. 3 . 95 -98 ( 256 ); cf. Staatsverträge 343 ) and against Antipater in 323 ( Staatsverträge 413 ). Leukas did not enter the Akarnanian Confederacy until the years 280 / 265 (cf. IG ix² . 1 3 A. 24 ( 263 ?); cf. Funke et al . ( 1993 ) 134 ; Schoch ( 1997 ) 74 ). In 435 , Leukas was allied with Corinth (no. 227 ) against Epidamnos (no. 79 ) (Thuc. 1 . 26 . 1 , 27 . 2 ) and against Korkyra (no. 123 ) in 433 (Thuc. 1 . 46 . 1 ). During the Corinthian War, it was allied with Boiotia, Athens (no. 361 ), Corinth and Argos (no. 347 ) (Diod. 14 . 82 . 3 ; Staatsverträge 225 ). In 368 , Leukas concluded a treaty(?) with Athens (no. 361 ) ( IG ii² 104 = Staatsverträge 278 ). Leukas was engaged in the following campaigns and battles: in the battle of Salamis with three ships (Hdt. 8 . 45 ); at Plataiai together with Anaktorion (no. 114 ) with 800 hoplites (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 5 ); at Epidamnos and Sybota with ten ships (Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 , 46 . 1 ); in the campaign of 427 with thirteen ships (together with Ambrakia (no. 113 ); Thuc. 3 . 69 . 1 , cf. Diod. 30 . 40 . 5 ); in 414 with two ships sent to Taras (no. 71 ; Thuc. 6 . 104 ); in the battle of Aigos potamoi ( 405 ) under Telykrates in Lysander's fleet (Paus. 10 . 9 . 10 ); against Korkyra,supporting the Lakedaimonian fleet,in 373 / 2 (Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 3 , 26 ); following Timoleon to Sicily with one ship in 345 / 4 (Plut. Tim. 8 . 5 ). The Leukadian mercenary leader Euthymos first fought under Timoleon, later against him, and was executed by him c. 339 (ibid. 30 . 6 -9 and 32 ). Leukadian envoys took the oaths on a treaty with Athens ( IG ii² 104 = Staatsverträge 278 ). The Leukadians Nausigenes and Euandros were appointed proxenoi by Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IAEpi 14 (C4 -C3 )). Theorodokoi wereappointed to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) ( SEG 23 189 . i . 8 ( 330 -324 )), Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 20 ( 356 / 5 ); IAEpi 14 ) and Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .B. 9 -13 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). In the 320 s, Leukas imported 15 , 000 medimnoi of grain from Kyrene (no. 1028 ) ( SEG 9 2 . 20 = Tod 196 ). In the Archaic or early Classical period the constitution changed from oligarchy to democracy.An Archaic law seems to have prescribed the preservation of the old κληtildeροι . The abolition of this law led to a democratisation of the Leukadian constitution, perhaps in C6 -C5 (Arist. Pol . 1266 b 21 -24 ; Gehrke, Stasis 101 ). Magistrates are attested generally, as αρχαί , by Arist. Pol . 1266 b 24 . Münsterberg ( 1973 ) 43 records more than sixty names of officials on Leukadian coins. An agora is attested explicitly only for the Heltic period ( forum , Livy 33 . 17 . 12 (r 197 )); no remains of it have yet been found (Fiedler ( 1996 ) 162 ). From a votive inscription on a miniature bronze helmet crest we know of a dedication to Athena ( IG ix² . 1 1237 (C6 )). A temple of Apollo was situated near the isthmus and the polis of Leukas (Thuc. 3 . 94 . 2 ; Strabo 10 . 2 . 9 ; Plut. Pomp. 24 , but cf. Dörpfeld ( 1927 ) 271 ). There were temples of Hera ( Heraeum , Livy 33 . 17 . 2 , near the city) and of Aphrodite Aineas (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 1 . 50 . 4 , on an island between the dioryktos and the polis , cf. the mention of a temple of Aphrodite in a Messenian inscription of C2 : Themelis ( 1993 ) 35 ; Strauch ( 1997 ) 240 with n. 120 ); for the remains of a temple at Ag. Ioannis Rodakis, see supra . The site of the λι µ ήν (Ps.-Skylax 34 ) is unknown (Fiedler ( 1996 ) 162 ). Two moles have been found at the southern end of the Leukas channel (Murray ( 1982 ) 226 ff; ( 1988 ) 101 ff; Fiedler ( 1996 ) 162 ; Schoch ( 1997 ) 20 ). The acropolis ( arx , Livy 33 . 17 . 11 (r 197 )) was presumably situated on the northern hill of the city (Fiedler ( 1996 ) 162 ). There are only a few, undated remains of a city wall (cf. muri , moenia : Livy 33 . 17 . 4 , 9 -10 , 13 (r 197 )) and of other walls to the north and northwest of the ancient polis (Fiedler ( 1996 ) 161 -63 ). The remains of houses dating to the Classical/Heltic period were laid out in accordance with a grid-plan street system (Fiedler ( 1996 ) 161 -62 ). The Leukadian mint is the oldest known in Akarnania, and its coins had the widest circulation. The silver coinage started in about 490 and was strongly influenced by Corinth (no. 227 ) (Carter ( 1993 ); cf. Anaktorion (no. 114 )). Next to the Corinthian, the Leukadian pegasi are the coins most frequently found in Sicilian and South Italian hoards (Talbert ( 1971 ) 60 , 62 ; IGCH passim (cf. p. 401 ); Taliercio Mensitieri and Spagnoli ( 1993 ) especially pls. 3 , 5 c (more than 500 pieces); CH viii. 53 , 95 , 159 , 160 , 167 , 226 , 232 , 264 , 506 ). Denominations: stater, drachm and smaller fractions. Types: obv . Pegasos; rev . head of Athena; legend: Λ , sometimes ΛΕΥ or ΛΕΥΚΑ∆ΙΩΝ . Smaller C4 denominations struck in bronze with various types. More than sixty names of officials are attested on Leukadian coins (Münsterberg ( 1973 ) 43 ; for the coins, see generally Postolakas ( 1868 ) 54 -89 ; Imhoof-Blumer ( 1878 ) 115 -38 ; Head, HN ² 329 -31 .

The toponym is Λι µ ναία , ηasper (Thuc. 2 . 80 . 8 , 3 . 106 . 2 ; IG iv² . 1 95 . 8 ( 356 / 5 )). The city-ethnic is Λι µ ναῖος ( IG ix² . 1 588 . 9 -10 (Sparta, C2 )). ⁷ Limnaia is not attested as a polis in ancient sources. It is mentioned under the heading Ακαρνανία in an Epidaurian and a Nemean theorodokoi list (C4 ) and was, at least in Heltic times,a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy (see infra ). Whether it was a polis or an ethnos in this Confederacy in the Classical period has to remain open. It is called a κώ µ η ατείχιστος by Thuc. 2 . 80 . 8 . The walls at Karvassaras (modern Amphilochia) to be identified with the site of Limnaia, however, suggest an urban centre. But they cannot be dated with certainty (cf. infra ). Thuc. 2 . 80 . 8 mentions Limnaia as a village in the Argeia, i.e. the territory of Argos Amphilochikon (no. 115 ) which was destroyed by a Spartan army under Knemon. Limnaia seems to have had a common frontier with Medion (no. 129 ) (to the south-west?) and with the Agraioi (Thuc. 3 . 106 . 2 ). According to Polyb. 5 . 5 . 14 , the καλου µ ένη Λι µ ναία was a coastal site in the Gulf of Arta. Limnaia is attested as a part of Akarnania in an Epidaurian theorodokoi list ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 8 ). It was a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy ( IG ix² . 1 588 . 9 -10 (Sparta, C2 ); cf. IG ix² . 1 3 A). Theorodokoi were appointed to host theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ; IG iv² . 1 95 . 8 ) and Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .A. 31 -33 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). As the evidence stands, the most likely reconstruction is that, in C5s, Limnaia was a κώ µ η belonging to Argos (no. 115 ), but by 356 / 5 it had become a political unit and acquired the status of polis . The urban centre was fortified, and the community became a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy in its own right. See Medion (no. 129 ) and Phoitiai (no. 134 ). The walls at Amphilochia, with polygonal masonry, are described and discussed by Pritchett ( 1992 ) 2 -6 , 118 -19 ; according to Winter ( 1971 ) 98 , 111 , they are not earlier than the last quarter of C4 ."
128,Matropolis (Matropolites),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,38.35,21.15,661,3292,"12 8. *Matropolis (Matropolites) Map 54 . Lat. 38 . 35 , long. 21 . 15 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: B. The toponym is * Ματρόπολις , ηasper (see the ethnic), in koine : Μητρόπολις (Polyb. 6 . 64 . 3 -4 ). The city-ethnic is Ματροπολίτας ( IG ix² . 1 3 B. 4 , 8 (C3 ); cf. Freitag ( 1994 ) 223 -24 no. 11 ). ⁸ ⁷ Perhaps other Akarnanian Limnaians are mentioned in Greek inscriptions, but normally a Limnaios will be identified with a citizen of the Thessalian city Limnaion,see infra 679 ; see Stählin ( 1926 ); Daux ( 1955 ) 38 ; SEG 15 340 and 19 379 . ⁸ Perhaps other Akarnanian Matropolitai are mentioned in Greek inscriptions, but normally a Matropolitas will be identified with a citizen of the homonym Thessalian city (no. 403 ) (cf. e.g. SEG 27123 . 11 ; Daux ( 1955 ) 37 -38 ). The same problem concerns the coinage of Matropolis (Isler ( 1996 ) 170 -71 n. 17 ). This Matropolis is not to be confused with the Μητρόπολις καλου µ ένη mentioned by Thuc. 3 . 107 . 1 in the territory of Argos Amphilochikon (Pritchett ( 1992 ) 25 -27 ). *Matropolis is not attested as a polis before C3 , when the term is found in the urban sense in Polyb. 4 . 64 . 4 (r 219 ) and in the political sense in an inscription concerning a boundary dispute between Oiniadai (no. 130 ) and *Matropolis found in Aitolian Thermos ( IG ix² . 1 3 B. 8 (C3 )). But the polis status of *Matropolis in the Classical period is strongly indicated by the toponym itself,the coinage of C4 (see infra ), the membership of both the Aitolian and the Akarnanian Confederacies (see infra ), and the existence of an urban centre at the site of Palaiomanina (identified convincingly with *Matropolis by Pritchett ( 1991 ) 8 -15 ; cf. Freitag ( 1994 ) 224 and see infra ). In C3s *Matropolis belonged to the Stratos district ( Στρατικοgraveν τέλος ) of the Aitolian Confederacy ( IG ix² . 1 3 B. 2 (before 230 ); cf. Swoboda ( 1913 ) 332 -33 n. 6 ; Klaffenbach ( 1957 ) xx ; Guarducci, EG ii 554 ; Freitag ( 1994 ) 223 -24 ). Later on, it is attested as a member of the Akarnanian koinon ( IG ix² . 1 209 , 208 and 588 . 11 (C2 ); cf. IG ix . 2 61 . 5 (Lamia, 216 -212 )), part of which it must have been before the Aitolian conquest of about 250 ( IG ix² . 1 3 A; cf. Klaffenbach ( 1957 ) xx ). *Matropolis had an acropolis ( άκρα ) as a part distinct from the city (Polyb. 4 . 64 . 4 ). The site of Palaiomanina fits very well the Polybian report, which is decisive for the identification (Pritchett ( 1991 ) 11 -12 , with reference to Kirsten). The walls of the acropolis, in trapezoidal masonry, are flanked with towers, while the enceinte of the city is constructed of polygonal blocks (for a description, see Pritchett ( 1991 ) 9 -12 , who reports Geometric pottery and metal objects found on the site: ibid. 10 ). A Pegasos-type stater of Corinthian standard ( obv . Pegasos; rev . head of Athena with Makedonian shield and monogram ΜΑ ) has been attributed to *Matropolis (Imhoof-Blumer ( 1878 ) 142 -43 ; Head, HN ² 331 ). Since then eighteen coins of this type have been found in Sicilian and South Italian hoards (Talbert ( 1971 ) 62 ; IGCH 2030 , 2180 , 2183 , 2185 , 2187 ; Taliercio Mensitieri and Spagnoli ( 1993 ) especially pls. 1 , 3 ; CH viii. 167 ). This coinage can be dated to C4s. SNG Cop.Acarnania 399 ."

Cabanes ( 1969 ) 550 ; SEG 36 331 .A. 44 (Nemea, 331 / 30 -313 ); Steph. Byz. 440 . 1 ). The cityethnic is Μεδιώνιος (Mastrokostas ( 1965 ) 159 no. 17 = SEG 25 633 (stamped roof-tile of C4 -C3 )). Medion is not attested as a polis before Polyb. 2 . 2 . 7 , 11 , 2 . 3 . 1 and 6 (r 231 ), where the term is found in the urban sense. But in theorodokoi lists of C4 it is recorded under the heading Akarnania, it is attested as a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy in C3 , it struck coins (see infra ) and had a walled urban centre (near modern Katouna (Pritchett ( 1991 ) 83 -88 ), where Medion is securely located by a tile stamp ( SEG 25 633 ) found there). So it was probably a polis already in the Classical period. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Heltic inscriptions ( IG ix² . 1 388 . 1 (Megara, C3 ), 582 . 46 (Magnesia, c. 207 )) and internally by a tile stamp ( SEG 25 633 (C4 -C3 )) and in abbreviated form ( ΜΕ ) on C4s coins ( infra ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is likewise attested externally in Heltic inscriptions ( IG ix² . 1 583 . 21 (Olympia, 216 ), 582 . 4 (Magnesia, c. 207 )). The name of the territory was Μεδιωνία (Polyb. 2 . 3 . 1 ). Medion is named among the other Akarnanian places in theorodokoi lists of C4 (see infra ). It was a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy ( IG ix² . 1 583 , 582 ) and appointed theorodokoi to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) ( SEG 23 189 . i . 2 ( 330 -324 ); cf. Cabanes ( 1969 ) 550 ), Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 13 ( 356 / 5 )) and Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .A. 44 -46 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). The walls of Medion, today poorly preserved, were of polygonal masonry (for a description, see Pritchett ( 1991 ) 85 -88 ). Remains of a Doric temple (C4 ?) and a horos inscription of a cult place of Asklepios are reported by Schwandner, AA ( 1989 ) 651 . Some bronze coins of C4s have been attributed to Medion by Imhoof-Blumer ( 1878 ) 139 -41 ; Head, HN ² 331 ; Hammond ( 1967 ) 729 .

The toponym is Οινιάδαι , οιasper (Thuc. 1 . 111 . 3 ; Soph. Tr. 510 ; Polyb. 4 . 65 . 4 -5 ; IG iv² . 1 95 . 9 ( 356 / 5 )); Οινειάδαι (Hippoc. Epid. 5 . 1 . 3 -8 ). According to Steph. Byz. 281 . 10 -11 , the original toponym was ' Ερυσίχη , probably a construct by Heltic authors (Freitag ( 1994 ) 22 ). The city-ethnic is Οινιάδας (Thuc. 2 . 82 , 3 . 94 . 1 ; IG ix² . 1 3 A. 22 , 24 -25 ( 263 ?)). Oiniadai is called a polis in the urban sense by Thuc. 2 . 102 . 2 and Ps.-Skylax 34 . The earliest attestation of the political sense is in a C3 decree ( IG ix² . 1 3 B. 7 -8 ). The word πατρίς is used by Diod. 18 . 8 . 6 (r c. 325 / 4 ; see Jehne ( 1994 ) 241 -43 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally by Thuc. 2 . 82 and 3 . 94 . 1 as well as in an inscription concerning a boundary dispute ( IG ix² . 1 3 B. 3 -4 , 7 -8 (C3 before 230 )) and internally on C3 coins ( infra ) and on a stamped tile ( SEG 42 486 (C3 -C2 )). The territory is called χώρα ( IG ix² . 1 3 B. 3 -4 (C3 ); Polyb. 21 . 32 . 14 ) or οιasper περιgrave Οινιάδαις τόποι (Thuc. 2 . 102 . 6 ) or ηasper Οινιάς (schol. Thuc. 2 . 102 ). It was situated in south-western Akarnania, at a distance of about 70 stades from the mouth of the river Acheloos (Strabo 10 . 2 . 2 ). It is attested as part of Akarnania in the theorodokoi lists (see infra ). T o the north, Oiniadai bordered on the territory of *Matropolis (no. 128 ) ( IG ix² . 1 3 B). The Argive hero Alkmaion passes for the founder of Oiniadai, while his son Akarnan gave his name to the whole region (Thuc. 2 . 102 . 5 -6 ; Jouan ( 1990 ); Gehrke ( 1994 -95 ) 46 -48 ). Messenians from Naupaktos (no. 165 ) attacked Oiniadai in 456 / 5 and forced its population to leave their town, but in the next year the Oiniadai returned (Paus. 4 . 25 . 3 ). In 325 / 4 (Jehne ( 1994 ) 241 -43 ), the Oiniadai were driven out by the Aitolians (Diod. 18 . 8 . 6 ; Plut. Alex. 49 . 8 ). On Kassander's advice the Oiniadai left their settlement in 314 and moved to Sauria (Diod. 19 . 67 . 4 ; cf. Freitag ( 1994 ) 222 -23 ). Strabo 10 . 2 . 2 mentions an old Oiniadai at a greater distance from the sea; the matter remains a mystery (for a discussion, see Freitag ( 1994 ) 226 -27 ). According to Freitag ( 1994 ) 236 with n. 97 , Oiniadai did not become a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy until 424 , when the polis was forced to join the Athenian League (Thuc. 4 . 77 . 2 ; Kagan ( 1974 ) 281 ). In the years before, Oiniadai had supported the Lakedaimonians against the Akarnanians and Athenians (Thuc. 2 . 82 ). In 263 (?), Oiniadai is attested as part of the Akarnanian koinon ( IG ix² . 1 3 A. 22 ). Oiniadai appointed theorodokoi to host theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ; IG iv² . 1 95 . 9 ( 356 / 5 )) and Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .A. 34 -7 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). An acropolis ( άκρα ) is attested by Polyb. 4 . 65 . 5 -11 (r 219 ). Remains of an edifice consisting of a complex of thirteen rooms on a hill-top near the acropolis may have been a dwelling house (cf.Powell ( 1904 ) 214 ). The existence of a city wall in the 450 s is indicated by Thucydides' reference to a poliorkia by the Athenians ( 1 . 111 . 3 ; cf. Paus. 4 . 25 . 2 claiming that in 456 / 5 the Messenians of Naupaktos (no. 165 ) tried to take Oiniadai using scaling ladders and µ ηχανή µ ατα ); Plutarch mentions a wall of Oiniadai at the time of the Periklean expedition to Akarnania (Plut. Per . 19 . 3 ); in 219 , Philip V fortified Oiniadai (again?; Polyb. 4 . 65 . 5 ff). There are substantial remains of a regular polygonal wall over 6 km in length (described by Powell ( 1904 ) 146 ff and Kirsten ( 1937 ) 2215 ff). It enclosed the acropolis and the lower city, an area of altogether 59 ha, and may date from C5 -C4 (Winter ( 1971 ) 236 ; Pritchett ( 1992 ) 117 -18 , against Kirsten ( 1937 ) 2224 , who argued that only the acropolis had been enclosed by a wall until Philip V fortified Oiniadai in 219 ). Inside the circuit, few remains of streets and houses are discernible (cf. the plan by Kirsten ( 1937 ) 2217 -18 ). The results of recent archaeological investigations have been published by Kolonas, Serbetis and Schmidt ( 1992 ). There are remains of a small temple on the western side of the harbour of Oiniadai, where a fragment of a foot from a statue has been found. Powell ( 1904 ) 205 suggests that it might have been Athena the Saviour, who was worshipped as the goddess of the sailors in the Piraeus. The evidence for silver coins remains doubtful (Head, HN ² 331 ). Bronze coins of C3 have the legend ΟΙΝΙΑ∆ΑΝ (Imhoof-Blumer ( 1878 ) 15 -17 , 151 ; Grose ( 1926 ) 5372 -9 ; IGCH 145 , 311 -12 ; SNG Cop.Acarnania 400 -3 )."
131,Palairos (Palaireus),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,38.5,20.5,845,4217,"131 . Palairos (Palaireus) Map 54 . Lat. 38 . 50 , long. 20 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: B. The toponym is Πάλαιρος (Epicharm. fr. 38 , Kaibel (CGF); IG iv² . 1 95 . 21 ( 356 / 5 )). The city-ethnic is Παλαιρευacuteς (Thuc. 2 . 30 . 1 ; IG ix² . 1 582 . 47 (Magnesia, c. 207 )) or Παλαιραῖος ( SEG 9 2 . 35 = Tod 196 (Kyrene, 330 -325 )). Palairos is not attested as a polis before the Heltic period unless one accepts a conjecture in the text of Ps.Skylax 34 : the MS has an otherwise unknown polis Φαρά listed between Leukas (no. 126 ) and Alyzeia and situated opposite Ithaka (and Kephallenia); instead of Φαρά , Wirbelauer ( 1998 ) 221 -22 conjectures Πάλαιρος . Palairos was probably a polis already in C5 : it was a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy, it had an urban centre, and it seems to have struck coins (see infra ). Palairos is called a polis in two inscriptions of C2 -C1 ( SEG 27 156 , 157 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in an inscription from Kyrene ( SEG 9 2 . 35 = Tod 196 ( 330 -326 )) as well as by Thuc. 2 . 30 . 1 and internally in two mutilated honorific inscriptions ( SEG 27 156 , 157 (C2 -C1 )). The external and individual use is attested in the feminine form on a grave stele : Παλαιραία ( IG ix² . 1 379 . 2 (undated)). Palairos was situated on the Plagia peninsula and bordered to the west on the Leukadian peraia (Wacker ( 1999 )). In 431 the Corinthian polisma Sollion (no. 137 ) on the southern side of the peninsula ( supra ) was given to Palairos by the Athenians (Thuc. 2 . 30 . 1 ). c. 330 -325 , the polis received 10 , 000 medimnoi of grain from Kyrene (no. 1028 ) ( SEG 9 2 . 35 = Tod 196 ). Palairos was part of Akarnania according to the theorodokoi lists (see infra ). The earliest explicit attestation of Palairos as a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy is of C3l ( IG ix² . 1 582 (Magnesia, c. 207 ); cf. IG ix² . 1 3 A), but the addition of Ακαρνάνων to the city-ethnic found both in Thuc. 2 . 30 . 1 ( Παλαιρευtildeσι Ακαρνάνων ) and in the Kyrenaian grain inscription ( SEG 9 2 . 35 = Tod 196 ( 330 -326 ): Ακαρνάνων Παλαιραίοις ) is a very strong indication that Palairos was a member from C5 onwards. Palairos appointed theorodokoi to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) ( SEG 23 189 . i . 5 ( 330 -324 )), Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 21 ( 356 / 5 )) and Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .A. 16 -19 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). The agora of Palairos with public buildings was possibly situated in the northern part of the upper city (Wacker ( 1996 b ) 94 ). Several cults of different deities are attested for Palairos but cannot be connected with existing remains. Outside the city, on the mountain Profitis Ilias, was a C4extra-urban sanctuary (Faisst and Kolonas ( 1990 )). On the way to this site, about 100 m from the north-western corner of the city wall, a shrine of Artemis has been located (Camp ( 1977 ) 280 -81 ; Wacker ( 1996 b ) 97 -98 ). T o the south-west of Profitis Ilias, on the summit of the mountain Sterna above the old village of Plagia, there are impressive remains of what must have been a fortified sanctuary controlled by Palairos (according to unpublished tile stamps: information from E.-L. Schwandner); other references concerning the site are given by Pritchett ( 1994 ) 205 -7 , who identifies it erroneously with Sollion (no. 137 ) (see supra ). There are virtually no traces left of walls or public architecture on the acropolis of Palairos, situated on the eastern summit of the upper city (Kirsten ( 1942 ) 2458 ). The acropolis and lower town were fortified. The existing circuit of walls of cyclopean, polygonal and horizontal masonry was not erected as late as C3 , as suggested by Kirsten, but most likely in C5 ; see Murray ( 1982 ) 145 ; Pritchett ( 1992 ) 115 -19 . Wacker ( 1999 ) 81 -90 gives a description of the different phases of the construction of the walls. In the whole area of the city, remains of houses are visible, in the western part of the upper city in an orthogonal structure (Wacker ( 1996 b ) 94 ; cf. Lang ( 1994 ) 243 ). There is only slight evidence for Palaerean coinage: a Pegasos with monogram read by Imhoof-Blumer ( 1878 ) 153 as ΠΑΛΑΙΡ ( ΟΣ ); cf. Head, HN ² 331 ."

Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 , Hude).The city-ethnic is Παλευacuteς (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 5 ; Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 , 2 . 30 . 2 ; I.Magnesia 35 . 39 ( c. 207 ); Paus. 6 . 15 . 7 ; Etym. Magn . 507 . 31 ) or Παλαιευacuteς (Polyb. 5 . 3 . 4 , 5 . 2 , 16 . 6 , 17 . 5 , 100 . 8 ). Paleis is referred to as a polis in the urban sense by the term τετράπολις at Thuc. 2 . 30 . 2 , where the use of cityethnics instead of toponyms indicates that the political sense is a connotation (Hansen ( 2000 ) 174 n. 3 , 208 ); cf. Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 33 : ταgraveς εν τηsubiotaηtilde ΚεφαλληνίΩsubiotaα πόλεις . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally by Hdt. 9 . 28 . 5 , 31 . 4 ; Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 , 2 . 30 . 2 ; and in a Heltic inscription from Magnesia ( I.Magnesia 35 . 39 ) and internally, in abbreviation, on coins (see infra ). The individual use is attested externally as Κεφαλλήν εκ Παλέων in a Delphic inscription ( BCH 68 / 9 ( 1944 -45 ) 121 no. 32 . 4 (C3 )). The territory of Paleis lies in the western part of the island of Kephallenia (cf. Thuc. 2 . 30 . 2 ; Paus. 6 . 15 . 7 ), today called Paliki. Hdt. 9 . 28 . 5 (cf. 31 . 4 ) erroneously lists 200 hoplites from Paleis among the Greeks fighting at Plataiai (cf. Bürchner ( 1921 ) 210 , 212 -13 ; Wirbelauer ( 1998 ) 319 -20 ). In 435 the Paleis supported the Corinthian campaign against Korkyra (no. 123 ) with four ships (Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 ). For membership in the Second Athenian Naval League and the Corinthian League,other alliances,military matters,envoys, theorodokoi , officials, taxation and founding myth, see the collective attestations of Kephallenians cited s.v. Kranioi (no. 125 ). A [. . .] στρατίδας was appointed proxenos by Delphi (no. 177 ) in 358 / 7 ( F.Delphes iii . 4 376 . 4 (suppl.)). A sanctuary of Poseidon(?) was discovered in the southern part of the Paliki peninsula at Valtsa (cf. Randsborg ( 1995 ) 97 and ( 2002 ) ii. 59 , 310 ). The acropolis of Paleis was situated on a hill at a distance of 1 . 5 km to the north of the modern town of Lixuri. Remains of the walls described by travellers up to the eighteenth century have disappeared because the stones were reused in buildings in Lixuri (Bürchner ( 1921 ) 211 ; Steinhart and Wirbelauer ( 2002 ) 333 -34 ; Randsborg ( 2002 ) ii. 281 -82 ). The silver coinage of Paleis started with a single type ( BMC Peloponnesus 84 no. 1 : obv . ram with legend Π ; rev . pine-cone and sprays, all in incuse square), before 431 . From 431 onward, Paleis struck silver coins. Denominations: tetrobols and smaller fractions. Types: Kephalos or Persephone (wearing barley wreath); legend: ΠΑ and/or ΚΕΦΑΛΟΣ or ΚΕΦΑ . Bronze coins date from C5 -C2 (see in general Postolakas ( 1868 ) 94 -96 ; Biedermann ( 1887 ) 67 -68 ; Head, HN ² 427 -28 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 2 . 795 -802 ; Grose ( 1926 ) nos. 6684 -93 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) 96 ; SNG Cop.

Our only source is Ps.-Skylax 34 , where ποgraveλις Φαρά is listed between Leukas (no. 126 ) and Ithaka (no. 122 ). Following Partsch ( 1889 ) 20 , Barr . places Phara on Leukas and identifies the settlement with modern Pyrgi. But in Ps.Skylax, Phara is listed after Leukas, and if Phara had been a polis on Leukas, Ps.-Skylax would undoubtedly have classified Leukas as a dipolis island. Thus, Phara must either have been one of the small islands between Leukas and Ithaka or situated on the coast of Akarnania in the peraia of Leukas. If weaccept Ps.-Skylax's text as it stands, Phara must be classified as an unlocated polis in Akarnania. Alternatively, one may assume a corruption and conjecture Πάλαιρος (Wirbelauer ( 1998 ) 221 -22 ; see supra 368 )."
134,Phoitiai (Phoitieus),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,38.4,21.1,639,2894,"134 . Phoitiai (Phoitieus) Map 54 . Lat. 38 . 40 , long. 21 . 10 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Φοιτίαι , αιasper ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 11 ( 356 / 5 )) or Φυτία , ηasper (Thuc. 3 . 106 . 2 ). The cityethnic is Φοιτιευacuteς ( CID ii 1 . ii . 16 , 23 ( 362 / 1 )) or Φοιτιάς ( IG ix² . 1 390 . 10 (C5 )) or Φοίτιος (Hellan. fr. 30 = Steph. Byz. 669 . 15 ). The only attestation of Phoitiai as a polis (in the urban sense) is at Polyb. 4 . 63 . 7 -9 , but in the Delphic naopoioi 's accounts of C4f the Phoitieis are recorded under the heading ταίδε τῶν πόλεων ( CID ii 1 . i . 27 and ii . 16 ). It was probably a polis already in C5 : it was a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy and it had an urban centre (see infra ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Delphic accounts ( CID ii 1 . ii . 16 ( 362 / 1 )). The individual use is attested externally in a proxeny decree of Stratos ( IG ix² . 1 390 . 10 (C5 )) and in CID ii 1 . ii . 23 ( 362 / 1 ). The territory ( ηasper Φυτία , Thuc. 3 . 106 . 2 ) belonged to the Akarnanian region, according to the theorodokoi lists (see infra ). The eponym of Phoitiai was Phoitios, son of Alkmaion and grandson of Amphiaraos (Steph. Byz. 669 . 13 -14 ). The fact that a Phoitian is attested as bolarchos of Stratos (no. 138 ) in a proxeny decree of C5l ( IG ix² . 1 390 . 9 -10 ) shows that Phoitiai was either a civic subdivision of Stratos or a dependent polis . In 362 / 1 Phoitiai and Stratos contributed jointly to the Delphic naopoioi's fund ( CID ii 1 . ii . 16 , 23 ), which indicates that Phoitiai was (now?) a polis side by side with Stratos and undoubtedly, like Stratos, a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy.Membership is explicitly stated in the Aitolian-Akarnanian treaty of c. 263 ( IG ix² . 1 3 A. 23 ). Phoitiai appointed theorodokoi to host theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 11 ( 356 / 5 )) and from Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .A. 47 -48 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). Ruins of a Doric temple are visible near Vlyziana (Kirsten ( 1941 b ) 440 ; Philippson and Kirsten ( 1958 ) 397 ; Schoch ( 1997 ) 57 ). Phoitiai is commonly located at the site of the Porta hills, 2 km to the north of Bambini (Pritchett ( 1991 ) 4 -7 ; Schoch ( 1997 ) 56 -58 ). There one can find remains of two acropoleis, to the north and to the south (Kirsten ( 1941 b ) 438 -39 ), and a circuit of walls about 2 . 8 km long, with eighteen (Noack) or eleven (Kirsten) towers, mostly of polygonal masonry (Noack ( 1916 ) 217 ff; Kirsten ( 1941 b ) 438 -42 ; Pritchett ( 1991 ) 6 -9 ). The date proposed by Noack and Schoch (( 1997 ) 57 -58 ), C5 -C4 , is preferable to that of Kirsten (( 1941 b ) 440 : C3 , before 219 ). The attribution to Phoitiai of some silver and bronze coins of C4m-C3m with the legend ΦΥ or Φ is not beyond doubt; cf. Imhoof-Blumer ( 1878 ) 152 -55 ; Head, HN ² 331 ; Kirsten ( 1941 b) 437 ."

The toponym is Πρόννοι , οιasper (Polyb. 5 . 3 . 3 ) or Πρῶννοι , οιasper ( IG ix² . 1 8 . 3 -4 (suppl.,C3 ); BCH 45 ( 1921 ) col. ii . 142 (C3 -C2 )) or Πρώναια (schol. Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 , Hude);cf. Πρώνησος in Strabo 10 . 2 . 13 . The city-ethnic is Προνναῖος (Thuc. 2 . 30 . 2 ) or Πρῶννος ( IG ii² 43 .B. 12 = Staatsverträge 257 ( 377 )) or Πρόνοος ( Etym.Magn . 507 . 31 ). Pronnoi is referred to as a polis in the urban sense by the term τετράπολις at Thuc. 2 . 30 . 2 , where the use of cityethnics instead of toponyms indicates that the political sense is a connotation (Hansen ( 2000 ) 174 n. 3 , 208 ); cf. Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 33 : ταgraveς εν τηsubiotaηtilde ΚεφαλληνίΩsubiotaα πόλεις . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in an Athenian psephisma ( IG ii² 43 .B. 12 ( 377 )) and internally on the coins (see infra ). The individual use is attested externally in Heltic inscriptions (see supra ). Pronnoi was situated in the south-eastern part of the island of Kephallenia (cf. Thuc. 2 . 30 . 2 ). Pronnoi was a member of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 .B. 12 = Staatsverträge 257 ( 377 ); cf. Dreher ( 1995 b ) 190 ) and of the Corinthian League of 338 / 7 ( IG ii² 236 .b. 12 = Staatsverträge 403 ). For other alliances, military matters, envoys and theorodokoi , taxation and founding myth, see the collective attestations of Kephallenians cited s.v. Kranioi (no. 125 ). Pronnoi is commonly identified with the site on the Pachni hill, where there are some remains of a Classical and Heltic settlement (C5 -C3 ; Randsborg ( 2002 ) i. 30 , 87 ; ii. 57 , 261 -64 ). This site matches Polybios' description of Pronnoi as a πολισ µ άτιον δυσπολιόρκητον almost to perfection (Polyb. 5 . 3 . 4 ). But we know about another acropolis in the Pronnoi territory, at Palaiokastro with remains of Mycenaean and Byzantine walls, and a rock-cut altar with three steps within (Steinhart and Wirbelauer ( 2002 ) 157 pls. 63 -64 ; Randsborg ( 2002 ) i. 15 -20 , 84 -86 ; ii. 57 , 258 -62 ). For other finds, see now the catalogue in Randsborg ( 2002 ) i. 4 -36 ; ii. 54 -59 . Near the chapel of Ag. Georgios, 3 km north of Skala, the foundations of a Doric temple (C6 -C3 ) are visible (Kalligas ( 1969 b ) 273 -76 ; Steinhart and Wirbelauer ( 2002 ) 156 , 158 , pls. 65 -66 , 335 ; Randsborg ( 2002 ) i. 12 -13 ; ii. 58 ), perhaps a cult of Poseidon in reaction to earthquakes,cf. Wirbelauer ( 1998 ) 182 -88 ). Pronnoi struck silver (triobols and smaller fractions) and bronze coins in C4 and/or C3 . Silver types: obv . head of Kephalos, or female head; rev . club; legend: ΠΡΩΝΝΩΝ or monogram with barley-corn. Bronze types: obv . head of Zeus; rev . monogram with pine-cone, which is interpreted as the symbol of Zeus Aine(s)ios (Postolakos ( 1868 ) 97 -98 ; Biedermann ( 1887 ) 71 ; Head, HN ² 428 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 2 . 807 -8 ; Grose ( 1926 ) 6694 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) 96 ; SNG Cop.

The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a Samaian decree from Magnesia ( I.Magnesia 35 . 15 , 16 , 18 , 27 , 29 ( c. 207 )) and on coins (see infra ). Same was situated in the northern and north-eastern part of Kephallenia (cf. Thuc. 2 . 30 . 2 ). In the northern peninsula today called Erisos, in the Pylaros valley, there are some remains of settlements and fortified places, e.g. a small ⁹ Perhaps other Samaioi are mentioned in Greek inscriptions,but sometimes the distinction between the various cities or ethnics beginning with Σα µ - is impossible. fortress of polygonal masonry at Pyrgos (C5 -C3 ; Partsch ( 1890 ) 64 -65 ; Steinhart and Wirbelauer ( 2002 ) 194 pl. 78 ; for a survey, see Randsborg ( 2002 ) i. 53 -60 ; ii. 54 -59 ). There are foundations of a temple outside the polis on the top of the hill Alpovuni (Partsch ( 1890 ) 72 and pl. 2 ; Randsborg ( 1995 ) 96 and ( 2002 ) ii. 58 ). For league membership, alliances, military matters, envoys, theorodokoi , taxation and foundation myth, see the collective attestations of Kephallenians cited s.v. Kranioi (no. 125 ). Two acropoleis are known to Livy ( 38 . 29 . 10 ), one called Cyneatis or Cyatis. Partsch ( 1890 ) 59 -72 gives a description of their wall circuit and of the walls joining them. The remains are of polygonal and rectangular masonry (C4 ?, certainly C3 ; Randsborg ( 2002 ) i. 43 -52 ; ii. 57 -58 , 264 -75 ). Same struck various silver and bronze coins from C5 onward.

The only source for a city-ethnic is Steph. Byz. 581 . 9 -10 , who suggests Σολλιευacuteς . Sollion is called both a polisma and a polis in the urban sense at Thuc. 2 . 30 . 1 . At 3 . 95 . 1 and 5 . 30 . 2 Thucydides uses the toponym without any site-classification. Thucydides describes Sollion as Κορινθίων πόλισ µ α ( 2 . 30 . 1 ), which indicates that Sollion was a colony of Corinth (no. 227 ) (Graham ( 1962 ), ( 1964 ) 118 -19 ), pace Salmon ( 1984 ) 277 -78 , who overlooked that Thuc. 2 . 30 . 1 uses polis synonymously with polisma . However, the colony was not an independent community, for at Thuc. 5 . 30 . 2 we are told that the Athenians had not complied with the terms of the Peace of Nikias and surrendered Sollion to the Corinthians. The inference is that Sollion was a dependent polis , a colony that to some extent was under Corinthian supremacy (Graham ( 1964 ) 118 -42 ). Sollion was conquered by the Athenians in 431 / 0 and handed over to the polis of Palairos (no. 131 ), Thuc. 2 . 30 . 1 : οιasper . . . Αθηναῖοι . . .

The presumption is that Sollion thereafter was the harbour of Palairos (Thuc. 3 . 95 . 1 ) and had ceased to be a polis . The exact location is unknown (cf.Pritchett ( 1992 ) 87 -88 , ( 1994 ) 205 -7 , who identifies Sollion with the ruins of Sterna (see Palairos (no. 131 )) and the recent discussions: Wacker ( 1996 b ) 96 -97 and Schoch ( 1997 ) 21 -22 ), but from Thuc. 3 . 95 . 1 one has to infer that Sollion lay on the south side of the Plagia peninsula, probably in or near Zaverda Bay."
138,Stratos (Stratios),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,38.4,21.2,1119,5017,"138 . Stratos (Stratios) Map 54 . Lat. 38 . 40 , long. 21 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Στράτος (Thuc. 2 . 80 . 8 ; IG iv² . 1 95 . 10 ( 356 / 5 )), οasper (Polyb. 5 . 13 . 10 ), or ηasper (Paus. 6 . 2 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is Στράτιος (Thuc. 2 . 81 . 2 ; IG ix² . 1 390 . 1 -2 (C5 ); CID ii 1 . ii . 17 , 22 ( 362 / 1 ); cf. Στρατικός , IG ix² . 1 3 A. 25 ( 263 ?)). Stratos is called a polis in the urban sense by Thuc. 2 . 81 . 2 , 4 -5 , 2 . 102 . 2 , 3 . 106 . 1 . The territorial sense is a connotation at Thuc. 2 . 80 . 8 . The political sense is attested in a C5 proxeny decree of Stratos ( IG ix² . 1 390 . 1 -2 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Delphic contribution list CID ii 1 . ii . 17 ( 362 / 1 ) and by Thucydides (see supra ), and internally in the proxeny decree mentioned above as well as on the coins (see infra ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in CID ii 1 . ii . 22 ( 362 / 1 ), and internally in a manumission inscription ( IG ix² . 1 394 . 4 , 10 (C2 )). Stratos was part of Akarnania ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 8 + 10 ( 356 / 5 ); SEG 36 331 .A. 15 + 38 ( 331 / 0 -313 ); Strabo 10 . 2 . 2 ), lying in the interior (Thuc. 2 . 102 . 1 ; Strabo 10 . 2 . 3 ) beside the river Acheloos (Polyb. 5 . 6 . 6 ) as πόλις µ εγίστη τηtildeς Ακαρνανίας (Thuc. 2 . 80 . 8 ). Its territory is called Στρατίων γηtilde (Thuc. 3 . 106 . 2 ). The Στρατικοgraveν τέλος of the Aitolian Confederacy included at least, besides Stratos itself, the poleis of Oiniadai (no. 130 ) and Matropolis (no. 128 ) ( IG ix² . 1 3 B. 2 (C3 before 230 )). Stratos was a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy and the seat of the federal institutions (Xen. Hell . 4 . 6 . 4 (r 389 ); IG ix² . 1 393 (C3 )). Klaffenbach ( 1957 a ) xiv suggests that the central position of Stratos in the Confederacyattested by Xen. Hell . 4 . 6 . 4 )-may be traced back to 424 . During the Peloponnesian War (in 429 ), citizens loyal to the Peloponnesians suffered expulsion by the Athenians (Thuc. 2 . 102 . 1 ). In 314 , on the advice of Cassander, many Akarnanians moved to Stratos (Diod. 19 . 67 . 4 ; see Freitag ( 1994 ) 222 -23 for the historical circumstances). Stratos honoured Lysias from Megara (no. 225 ) and his two sons with proxenia ( IG ix² . 1 390 (C5 )) and appointed theorodokoi to host theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 10 ( 356 / 5 )) and Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .A. 38 -40 , B. 38 -40 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). A Stratian Olympic winner with unknown name is attested for 368 ( Olympionikai 416 (?)). He was honoured with a statue by Lysippos (Paus. 6 . 2 . 1 ). The oldest attested public enactment is the proxeny decree of C5 ( IG ix² . 1 390 ), which mentions a bolarchos from Phoitiai (no. 134 ) (ibid. 390 . 9 ). Tothe west of the middle hill lay the agora of Stratos, with large stoai , a bouleuterion and a great altar, all of C4 (Schwandner, AA ( 1991 ) 614 , ( 1992 ) 669 , ( 1993 ) 678 , ( 1995 ) 783 , ( 1996 ) 555 -56 with pls. 2 -3 , ( 1997 ) 509 -10 ; Lang ( 1994 ) 243 ). The ruins of the Doric temple of Zeus (C4 ; cf. IG ix² . 1 394 . 4 , 18 (suppl.,C2 ), and IG ix² . 1 395 (C4 , perhaps a list with contributions to the temple building)) have been studied by Picard and Courby (( 1924 ); cf. Zschietzschmann ( 1931 ) 334 -35 ; Wurster ( 1973 ) 209 -10 ; Bankel ( 1984 )). At a distance of about 4 km to the west of Stratos (site of Spathari), remains of an Archaic temple (C6 , with Heltic restorations and, probably, a Geometric predecessor) have recently been excavated (Schwandner ( 1994 ), AA ( 1995 ) 784 -86 , ( 1996 ) 557 -58 ). Midway between this temple and the city, another extra-urban sanctuary existed, which was discovered in 1993 (Schwandner, AA ( 1995 ) 783 -84 ). The C4 theatre of Stratos (now excavated: Schwandner, AA ( 1993 ) 678 , ( 1996 ) 555 -56 , ( 1997 ) 509 ; TGR ii: 302 ) accommodated c. 8 , 000 spectators (Lang ( 1994 ) 243 ). The acropolis of Stratos was situated on the northern edge of the city. The circuit of walls (Pritchett ( 1989 ) 137 -39 ) built of pseudo-isodomic masonry and surrounding both the fortified acropolis and the town was about 7 . 5 km long and enclosed an area of c. 80 ha. According to Thuc. 2 . 81 . 2 , Stratos was a walled city in 429 , which suggests ( pace Winter ( 1971 ) 112 n. 26 ) that the existing enceinte dates from at least C5 (Pritchett ( 1992 ) 115 -16 ; Gehrke ( 1994 -95 ) 44 -45 ); at present archaeology dates the fortification to C4l (Schwander and Kolonas ( 1996 )). Stratos struck silver coins c. 450 -400 . Denominations: pentobols and smaller fractions. Types: obv . head of Acheloos; rev . head of Kallirhoë; legend: ΣΤΡΑΤΙΩΝ , ΣΤΡΑ , ΣΤΡ , Σ (Imhoof-Blumer ( 1878 ) 156 -67 ; Head, HN ² 331 -32 ; Grose ( 1926 ) no. 5380 ; IGCH nos. 88 , 208 ; SNG Cop.

The toponym is Θυacuteρρειον , τό ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 16 ( 356 / 5 ); SEG 36 331 .A. 26 ( 331 / 30 -313 ); in Ps.Skylax 34 one should read Θυacuteρρειον instead of the MS's Ουριτόν ; see Kirsten ( 1961 ); Marcotte ( 1985 ) 255 ) or Θυacuteριον (Polyb. 4 . 6 . 2 , 24 . 3 ; Θουacuteριον in Polyb. 18 . 10 . 10 , 28 . 5 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is Θυacuteρρειος ( IG ix² . 1 3 A. 23 ( 263 ?)) or Θυρρευacuteς ( IG ix² . 1 582 . 46 ( c. 207 )), Θυριευacuteς (Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 37 ), Θυρρειευacuteς ( SGDI 2658 ( 315 -280 )) or Θουacuteριος (Androtion ( FGrHist 324 ) fr. 65 = Steph. Byz. 320 . 21 ). Thyrreion was never called a polis before Heltic times ( IG ix² . 1 243 . 2 (C3 ), 244 . 5 -6 (C3 -C2 , restored); SEG 13 327 . 7 -8 ( c. 192 , restored)), unless one accepts Kirsten's emendation of Ps.-Skylax 34 (see supra ). Xenophon speaks, in connection with poleis in Akarnania, of the Thyrreians having a χωρίον καρτερόν ( Hell . 6 . 2 . 37 ). However, Thyrreion was a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy, had a walled urban centre and struck coins in C4 (see infra ); so it was probably a polis in the Classical period. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in inscriptions of C3 ( IG ix² . 1 3 B. 3 ; ix² . 2 243 . 2 ) and by Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 37 , and internally on coins and tile stamps ( IG ix² . 1 366 ; SEG 25 632 (C3 )). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Heltic inscriptions ( SGDI 2658 (Delphi, 315 -280 ); IG ix² . 1 3 A. 23 ( 263 ?)) and internally in SEG 43 227 . 4 -6 ( 167 ?). Thyrreion was part of Akarnania (Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 37 ; IG iv² . 1 95 . 8 + 16 ( 356 / 5 ); SEG 36 331 .A. 15 + 26 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). As a member of the Akarnanian Confederacy, it is not explicitly attested before about 263 ( IG ix² . 1 3 A. 23 ; cf. also ix² . 2 582 (Magnesia, c. 207 )), but considering the mention of the community in Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 37 and in the theorodokoi lists ( supra ), membership can be traced back at least to C4 . Xenophon regarded the Thyrreians as brave soldiers ( Hell . 6 . 2 . 37 ). c. 300 , Herakleitos of Thyrreion was appointed proxenos by Delphi (no. 177 ) ( SGDI 2658 ; cf. LGPN iii A 195 s.v. ' Ηράκλειτος ). Thyrreion appointed theorodokoi to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) ( SEG 23 189 . i . 4 ( 330 -324 , restored)), Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 16 ( 356 / 5 )) and Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .A. 26 -7 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). A sanctuary of Zeus Meilichios is attested in a C5 horos inscription (Mastrokostas ( 1965 ) 157 no. 11 = SEG 25 630 ). The acropolis of Thyrreion is mentioned in an unpublished inscription of C3 ; for the ruins, see Pritchett ( 1992 ) 89 -90 with references. The walls are described by Kirsten ( 1956 ) 58 -59 (with Noack's plan) and Pritchett ( 1992 ) 89 -90 (with bibliography); for recent excavations at Thyrreion,see BCH 114 ( 1990 ) 758 . According to Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 37 , Thyrreion must have been fortified already in C4 (cf. Lang ( 1994 ) 242 ). According to an inscription found during excavation at Rouga by L. Kolonas, Thyrreion had a harbour, probably by the name of 'Nesos' . In C4s, Thyrreion struck staters of Corinthian type and standard (pegasi), with the legends Θ , ΘΥ , ΘΥΡ , ΘΥΡΡ (Imhoof-Blumer ( 1878 ) 168 -74 ). Most of the surviving specimens (more than 300 pieces) have been found in hoards from Sicily and Magna Graecia (Talbert ( 1971 ) 62 ; Taliercio Mensitieri and Spagnoli ( 1993 ) especially pl. 3 ). Some bronze coins were struck in the same period. Types: obv . Athena; rev . owl; legend: ΘΥΡΡΕΩ (Head, HN ² 332 -33 ; Grose ( 1926 ) nos. 5381 -86 ; Hammond ( 1967 ) 726 , 729 ; IGCH passim (cf. p. 408 ); Taliercio Mensitieri and Spagnoli ( 1993 ) especially pl. 5 l; CH viii. 159 , 167 , 232 , 506 , 580 ; Liampi ( 1996 ) 174 ; SNG Cop.Acarnania 407 -16 )."
140,Torybeia (Torybeieus),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,38.45,21.05,558,2729,"140 . Torybeia (Torybeieus) Map 54 . Lat. 38 . 45 , long. 21 . 05 (?). Size of territory: 2 (?). Type: B. The toponym is Τορυacuteβεια , ηasper ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 18 with SEG 11 411 ( 356 / 5 )) or Τυacuteρβειον , τό ( SEG 23 189 . i . 7 (suppl., 330 -324 ); F.Delphes iii . 3 203 . 5 and Flacelière ( 1937 ) 441 n. 1 (suppl., both 272 )). The city-ethnic is Τορυβειευacuteς ( CID II 26 . 18 , 19 (suppl., C4 )) or Ακαρνάν εκ Τυρβείυν ( F.Delphes iii . 3 203 . 5 and Flacelière ( 1937 ) 441 n. 1 (suppl.)). Torybeia is not attested as a polis . But in C4 theorodokoi lists it is recorded under the heading Akarnania, and in C3 it is attested as a member of the Confederacy (see infra ). If one accepts the identification of the ruins of Komboti with Torybeia (cf. Kirsten ( 1940 ) 298 ff; Klaffenbach ( 1957 ) 36 ; Pritchett ( 1992 ) 104 -8 ; Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 340 n. 333 ) and the interpretation of the coins given below, there can be little doubt that Torybeia was a polis already in the Classical period. The collective use of the city-ethnic is perhaps attested internally on coins (in abbreviation, see infra ); the external and individual use is attested in two Delphic inscriptions ( CID ii 26 . 18 , 19 (suppl., C4 ); F.Delphes iii . 3 203 . 5 (C3 )). Torybeia was part of Akarnania ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 8 + 18 with SEG 11 411 ) and is attested in 272 as a member of the Akarnanian koinon ( F.Delphes iii . 3 203 . 5 and Flacelière ( 1937 ) 441 n. 1 (restored)). It appointed theorodokoi to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) ( SEG 23 189 . i . 7 ( 330 -324 , restored)) and Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 18 ; SEG 11 411 ); cf. Cabanes ( 1985 ) 346 -47 . The kastro of Komboti, presumably the site of Torybeia, shows remains of an agora and stoas (Heuzey ( 1860 ) 350 ff; Pritchett ( 1992 ) 104 -8 ) as well as a circuit wall of mostly polygonal masonry (Pritchett loc. cit .). The city was built on a grid plan ('Streifenstadt') with characteristic house types of a certain luxury (bathrooms); see Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 218 , 306 , 320 with fig. 305 ; Lang ( 1994 ) 242 -43 . Imhoof-Blumer (( 1878 ) 112 -13 ) reports two small silver coins of similar type and of equal weight with types: obv . Acheloos; rev . ΚΟ or ΤΟ below the cross of a capital Τ . Since Imhoof-Blumer could not know of the inscriptions attesting Akarnanian Torybeia, he interpreted ΚΟ and ΤΟ as names of officials. Both Koronta (no. 124 ) and Torybeia were situated in central Akarnania and, in the light of the epigraphical evidence, we should now tentatively interpret the letters as abbreviations of the city-ethnics ΚΟ ( ΡΟΝΤΑΙΩΝ ) and ΤΟ ( ΡΥΒΕΙΩΝ ). If so, this would be the first evidence of Torybeian coinage."
141,Zakynthos (Zakynthios),Akarnania and Adjacent Areas,37.45,20.55,1213,5655,"141 . Zakynthos (Zakynthios) Map 54 . Lat. 37 . 45 , long. 20 . 55 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Ζάκυνθος , ηasper (Hdt. 6 . 70 . 2 , 9 . 37 . 4 ; Thuc. 2 . 80 . 1 ; IG iv 619 . 9 (Argos, C3 )). The city-ethnic is Ζακυacuteνθιος (Hdt. 3 . 59 . 1 , 6 . 70 . 2 ; Thuc. 1 . 47 . 2 , 2 . 9 . 4 ; SEG 40 507 (C5 -C4 ); IG ii² 43 .B. 35 = Staatsverträge 257 ( 373 / 2 ); for the date, see now Dreher ( 1995 a ) 18 ). Zakynthos is called a polis in the urban sense by Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 3 and Ps.-Skylax 43 . Under the heading πόλεις , Zakynthos is listed as an ally of Athens (no. 361 ) in 431 (Thuc. 2 . 9 . 1 , 4 ) and in 373 / 2 as a member of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 . 32 , 70 , 78 , B. 35 -38 ). The use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in an Attic inscription ( IG ii² 43 .B. 35 ) and in the authors quoted above, and internally on the coins (see infra ). The individual use is attested externally in various inscriptions (e.g. SEG 40 507 (Michalitsi, C5 -C4 ); IG v 1 1457 . 7 (Messene, C4 -C3 )). The name of the territory is νηtildeσος Ζάκυνθος (Thuc. 2 . 66 . 1 ). There was a place Νηtildeλλος occupied by democrats during a stasis in 373 / 2 ( IG ii² 43 .B. 35 ; cf. Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 2 ; Diod. 15 . 45 . 2 calls it Αρκαδία ; for a discussion, see Mitchel ( 1981 ) 73 ff). The island was situated προgrave τουtilde Κορινθιακουtilde κόλπου (Strabo 2 . 5 . 20 ) near Elis (no. 251 ) (Thuc. 2 . 66 . 1 ; cf. Strabo 8 . 2 . 2 , 10 . 2 . 18 , 17 . 3 . 20 ), Kephallenia (Diod. 16 . 6 . 5 , 9 . 4 ) and Ithaka (no. 122 ) (Heliod. Aeth . 5 . 22 . 5 ). Zakynthos formed a regional unit together with Korkyra (no. 123 ), Kephallenia and Akarnania (Thuc. 2 . 7 . 3 ). According to Thuc. 2 . 66 , Zakynthos was a colony of the Achaians.This seems not implausible.In the mythical tradition, the founder of the city was Zakynthos, son of Dardanos, from Arkadian Psophis (no. 294 ; Paus. 8 . 24 . 3 ), which is perhaps spun out of the name of the Zakynthian acropolis (cf. the alternative name Αρκαδία for Νηtildeλλος ; see supra ). Another tradition is reflected in Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom. 1 . 50 . 3 and Steph. Byz. 294 . 3 , who mentions Bateia as the oecist of the island. In 433 , 1 , 000 Zakynthian hoplites joined the Korkyraians against Corinth (no. 227 ) (Thuc. 1 . 47 . 2 ). At the beginning of the Peloponnesian War ( 431 ), Athens sent an envoy to Zakynthos to ascertain the Kephallenians' loyalty (Thuc. 2 . 7 . 3 ; cf. Diod. 12 . 43 . 5 ). During the Peloponnesian War, Zakynthos was allied with Athens (e.g. Thuc. 2 . 7 . 3 , 9 . 4 , 66 ; Ar. Lys . 394 ) and supported the Athenians with money, infantry and ships (Thuc. 2 . 9 . 4 -5 , 3 . 94 -95 , 4 . 8 . 2 -5 , 4 . 13 . 2 , 7 . 31 . 2 , 57 . 7 ). After the Peloponnesian War, Zakynthos became oligarchic. At the beginning of C4 , the tyrant Dionysios of Syracuse settled, among others, 600 Messenian exiles from Naupaktos (no. 165 ) and Zakynthos in Sicilian Messana (no. 51 ) (Diod. 14 . 78 . 5 (r 396 )). Probably during the Corinthian War,the oligarchs were driven out of Zakynthos by the democratic faction (Diod. 15 . 45 . 2 , misplaced); but a few years later, presumably after the King's Peace ( 386 ), they in turn exiled the democrats. These democrats were brought to Νηtildeλλος by the Athenian general Timotheos in 375 . They sided with the Athenians, while the oligarchs in the town were allied with Sparta (no. 345 ), sent envoys to Sparta, and in 374 supported the Peloponnesian fleet under Mnasippos against Korkyra (Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 2 -3 ; Diod. 15 . 45 . 2 -3 ; IG ii² 43 .B. 37 -38 ; Gehrke, Stasis 198 -99 ). Zakynthos entered the Second Athenian Naval League, probably in 373 / 2 ( IG ii² 43 .B. 35 -38 = Staatsverträge 257 ; cf. Gehrke, Stasis 198 ). The island was the base for Dion's operations before his return to Sicily (Plut. Dio 22 . 8 -25 . 2 ), and he had Zakynthian mercenaries in his army (Diod. 16 . 31 . 7 ; Plut. Dio 57 . 2 , 4 (r 357 -354 )). In 338 / 7 Zakynthos became a member of the Corinthian League ( IG ii² 236 .b. 12 (suppl.); cf. Staatsverträge 403 ). The Zakynthian Menalkos was appointed proxenos by the Messenians ( IG v . 1 1425 (C4 -C3 )). A Zakynthian winner is attested for an unknown Athenian festival ( IG ii² 2312 . 7 (suppl., C4f)). The following cult sites are attested: a temple of Apollo (Plut. Dio 23 . 3 (r 357 )) and a temple of Aphrodite (Dion.Hal. Ant. Rom. 1 . 50 . 3 ) with statues of Aphrodite and Aineias. Benton ( 1932 ) 217 reports traces of another temple. There existed a stadion in Zakynthos (Plut. Dio 23 . 4 (r 357 )) and a harbour (Ps.-Skylax 43 ), situated near the town (Heliod. Aeth . 5 . 18 . 3 ). The name of the acropolis was Ψωφίς (Paus. 8 . 24 . 3 ; Steph. Byz. 705 . 4 , citing Paus.). According to Strabo 3 . 4 . 6 and App. Hisp . 25 , Saguntum in Spain was a colony of Zakynthos, but that seems to be derived from the similarity of the names (cf. SEG 42 972 . 2 ). Steph. Byz. ( 159 . 11 -13 ) calls the Libyan city of Barka a κτίσ µ α Πέρσεως Ζακυacuteνθου Αριστο µ έδοντος Λυacuteκου , obviously a mythographical construction possibly connected with Psophis, which is attested as a Libyan polis in Steph. Byz. 705 . 2 . Hdt. 3 . 59 mentions Zakynthians in Cretan Kydonia (no. 968 ). Their relationship to the inhabitants of our island is not clear. From C5 onward, Zakynthos struck silver 'drachms and smaller fractions with the type of a tripod, thus initiating the Apolline theme which was to remain prominent throughout Zacynthian coinage' (Kraay ( 1976 ) 96 ). Types: obv . Apollo laureate; rev . tripod; legend: ΖΑ , ΖΑΚΥΝΘΙΩΝ , or ## II. The Poleis"
142,Agrinion (Agrinieus),Aitolia,38.4,21.2,331,1688,"142 . Agrinion (Agrinieus) Map. 55 . Lat. 38 . 40 , long. 21 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 ? Type: B. The toponym is Αγρίνιον , τό (Polyb. 5 . 7 . 7 ; Hsch. A 797 ). The city-ethnic is Αγρινιευacuteς ( Syll. ³ 603 . 3 (C2e)) or, once and probably in error: Αγλινιευacuteς ( IG ix² . 1 625 . 2 (C2e)). Agrinion is called a polis in the urban sense (Diod. 19 . 67 . 4 (r 314 )). The individual and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested for citizens serving as magistrates in the Aitolian Confederacy ( IG ix² . 1 618 . 3 ); the external use is attested for a Delphic hieromnemon ( Syll. ³ 603 . 3 , C2e). At 19 . 67 . 4 Diodoros reports that,in 314 , King Kassander of Macedon convened an ekklesia of the Akarnanians and persuaded them to leave the small and unfortified settlements and move into a few poleis of which Stratos, Sauria and Agrinion are explicitly mentioned. As a result the Derieis ( SEG 36 331 .A. 41 (C4s); IG iv²1 96 . 61 , 65 (C3m)) and other Akarnanians were synoecised into Agrinion (Diod. 19 . 67 . 4 ). Shortly afterwards Agrinion was besieged and conquered by the Aitolians (Diod. 19 . 68 . 1 ). It seems reasonable to infer that Agrinion must have been a polis during the last decades of the Classical period. Agrinion may have been an urban settlement founded by the Agrinian ethnos , but there is no evidence (Antonetti ( 1987 a ); 236 ; Dany ( 1999 ) 37 f). Agrinion is identified with Megali Chora (once Zapandi) situated c . 3 km north-west of modern Agrinion, with remains of a fortified settlement (defence circuit,stoa,houses) of uncertain date but undoubtedly going back to C4 (Bommeljé ( 1987 ) 96 ; Antonetti ( 1990 ) 236 f; Strauch ( 1996 ) 255 f)."

In his account of the Athenian attack on Aigition in 426 . Thucydides calls Aigition a polis in the urban sense, describing how the inhabitants found refuge in the hills above the city: υasperπέφευγον γαgraveρ οιasper άνθρωποι καιgrave εκάθηντο επιgrave τῶν λόφων τῶν υasperπεgraveρ τηtildeς πόλεως . From Thucydides' account it is reasonable to infer that Aigition was a relatively small fortified settlement. On its polis status, see the exchange of views between M. H. Hansen and P. Funke in Funke ( 1997 ) 173 -76 and Hansen ( 2000 ) 200 . There is no other mention of Aigition in any source. Aigition was situated some 80 stades from the sea in the country settled by the Apodotai, one of the three major Aitolian tribes (Thuc. 3 . 97 . 2 ; Funke ( 1997 ) 148 ). It must have been close to the border between Aitolia and Lokris, and has been identified with the ancient Classical-Heltic remains near Strouza. One km west of the village Strouza-now abandoned-is a fortified settlement ('Strouza A') and a hill-top stronghold ('Strouza B') and not far away is the so-called Fortress on Mt. Boucheri (Bommeljé ( 1987 ) 75 ; Bommeljé et al . ( 1981 -88 ); Pritchett ( 1991 ) 67 -75 ; Strauch ( 1996 ) 256 )."
144,Akripos,Aitolia,,,132,702,"144 . Akripos Map 55 . Unlocated, not in Barr . Type: C. The toponym is Αacuteκριπος (-ον ?). The only thing we know about Akripos is that in, probably, 355 a theorodokos was appointed to host theoroi from Epidauros: Ακρίπωι . Μυacuteστρων ( IG iv²1 95 . 34 ). In the document, Akripos, Hyporeiai, Therminea, Phylea, and Proschion (ll. 34 -38 ) are listed after Amphilocheian Argos (l. 33 ) and before Syracuse (l. 39 ). While Hyporeiai seems to have been part of Akarnania (cf. Robert ( 1940 ); LGPN s.v. ' Εχε µ ένης and Φιλοίτιος ), the other sites were presumably Aitolian towns situated in the borderland between Aitolia and Akarnania; see Antonetti ( 1987 b ) 100 f and Funke ( 1997 ) 183 n. 73 ."

Il . 2 . 640 ; Thuc. 1 . 108 . 5 ; Strabo 9 . 4 . 8 ), or Χάλκεια , ηasper (Polyb. 5 . 94 . 8 ; cf. Walbank ( 1957 ) 625 ), or ' Υποχαλκίς (Hecat. quoted by Steph. Byz. at 651 . 13 , not recorded as a fragment in FGrHist 1 ). The city-ethnic is, possibly, Χαλκ [ ιδεῖς ] (Alcm. fr. 24 . 18 , Calame), perhaps denoting both Euboian and Aitolian Chalkis. Chalkis is called a πόλιν Κορινθίων at Thuc. 1 . 108 . 5 . It is unwarranted with some editors to delete πόλιν . Thus, Thucydides classified Chalkis as a polis , primarily in the urban sense, but the genitive Κορινθίων points to the political sense as a connotation. Quoting Hekataios, Steph. Byz. ( 651 . 13 ) lists Hypochalkis as a polis , but it is uncertain whether the site-classification stems from Hekataios (Hansen ( 1997 ) 17 -18 ). Chalkis is called Aitolian by Homer ( Il . 2 . 639 ) and Alkman (fr. 24 , Calame); but Thucydides'description of the city as Corinthian indicates that Chalkis was a Corinthian dependency, though probably not a colony settled by Corinthians (Salmon ( 1984 ) 213 , 268 , 277 -79 ). During the later part of the Archidamian War Chalkis was controlled by Athens (Thuc. 2 . 83 . 3 ). Chalkis was situated on a small coastal plain between M. Chalkis (Varassova) and M. Taphiassos (Klokova) (Strabo. 9 . 4 . 8 ). On the coast, upon the hill Hag. Triadha at modern Kato Vasiliki, are the remains of a defence circuit and some houses belonging to a settlement of the Classical and Heltic periods (Woodhouse ( 1897 / 1973 ) 106 -14 ; Bommeljé ( 1987 ) 112 ; Antonetti ( 1990 ) 283 f; Dietz et al . ( 1998 ), ( 2000 )). For the control of the Corinthian Gulf, Chalkis was a strategically important harbour (Thuc. 2 . 83 . 3 ; Polyb. 5 . 94 . 8 ; cf. Freitag ( 2000 ) 53 -57 ). Above the city on the southern slope of M. Varassova are substantial remains of a C5 ?-C4fortress (Noack ( 1916 ) 238 f; Bommeljé ( 1987 ) 112 ; Ober ( 1992 ) 165 ; Houby-Nielsen and Moschos in Dietz et al . ( 1998 ) 255 -57 ). Chalkis may have struck coins in C4 (unpublished)."

The only attestation of a city-ethnic is in Steph. Byz. 74 . 17 . At Ps.-Skylax 35 Halikyrna is one of three toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις εν αυτηsubiotaηtilde εισιgraveν αιasperacuteδε , where the term polis is used in the urban sense. The late sources have κώ µ η . According to Ps.-Skylax, Halikyrna was situated between Kalydon and Pleuron.Halikyrna is identified with the ancient remains near modern Agios Symeon (Khilia Spitia).

The earliest references to Kallipolis as a polis are of the Heltic period ( IG ix² . 1 154 ), but the toponym as well as the archaeological remains show that the polis status of the settlement goes back to the Classical period. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on a preserved specimen of the seal of the polis (Pantos ( 1985 ) 545 f), and externally in a decree of C3l ( IG ix² . 1 186 ); the individual and external use is found in a Delphic proxeny decree of c. 425 -375 ( F.Delphes iii . 1 422 . 3 -4 ) and in references to citizens serving as federal magistrates ( IG ix² . 1 3 .A. 16 , 19 (C3 )). The city was situated in the interior of Aitolia at Velouchovo, in the central part of the Mornos valley ( = ancient Daphnos) (Laffineur ( 1977 ); SEG 28 504 (C2 /C1 )). In C4 Kallion/Kallipolis became the urban centre of the tribe of the Kallieis, who in C5 /C4 were still part of the large Aitolian tribe of the Ophiones (Thuc. 3 . 96 . 3 ). Kallipolis was founded in C4m at the latest, and was from the outset laid out as a planned city. Excavations have revealed substantial remains of a defence circuit (enclosing an area of c. 25 ha) with a separate wall of the acropolis, a C3 bouleuterion (Gneisz ( 1990 ) no. 29 ), a stoa, a theatre, and two sanctuaries (Antonetti ( 1990 ) 289 -92 ). Among the excavated houses are remains of an archive (C4s) in which were found over 600 seals of C3 /C2 (Pantos ( 1985 ); Habicht ( 1985 ) 44 -46 ; Funke ( 1987 ) 95 f, ( 1991 b ) 326 , ( 1997 ) 171 -72 ; Themelis ( 1999 ) 431 -36 ). On the archaeological remains, see Themelis ( 1979 ), ( 1999 ); Bakhuizen ( 1992 ), ( 1994 ); Vroom ( 1993 ); Strauch ( 1996 ) 291 -94 . Votive offerings of the Heltic period testify to cults of Demeter and Kore ( SEG 40 458 (C3 -C2 )), Artemis ( IG ix² . 1 155 (C3 -C2 )) and Eileithya ( IG ix² . 1 156 , undated). A C5lex sacra contains a ban on entering an otherwise unknown sanctuary ( SEG 16 368 ; cf. Antonetti ( 1990 ) 287 -96 )."
148,Kalydon (Kalydonios),Aitolia,38.2,21.3,815,3969,"148 . Kalydon (Kalydonios) Map. 55 . Lat. 38 . 20 , long. 21 . 30 . Size of territory: 2 ? Type: [A]. The toponym is Καλυδών , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 640 ; Thuc. 3 . 102 . 5 ; Xen. Hell. 4 . 6 . 1 ). The cityethnic is Καλυδώνιος (Lys. 13 . 71 ; Pantos ( 1985 ) no. 238 ). In the Iliad Kalydon is described as a polis in the Heroic Age (Hom. Il . 9 . 531 ). At Ps.-Skylax 35 Kalydon is the first of three toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις εν αυτηsubiotaηtilde εισιgraveν αιasperacuteδε , where the term polis is used in the urban sense. The earliest epigraphical reference to a πόλις Καλυδωνίων is on a C2statue base ( IG ix² . 1 140 . 1 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a dedication of C5l ( SEG 32 550 , partly restored) as well as in the public seal (Pantos ( 1985 ) no. 238 ; cf. Pantos ( 1988 ), undated), and externally in Xen. Hell . 4 . 6 . 1 . The individual and external use is attested in an Athenian citizenship decree for Thrasyboulos of Kalydon (Lys. 13 . 71 ; cf. IG i³ 102 + add. 946 ). In the Catalogue of Ships Kalydon is recorded as an Aitolian city ( Il . 2 . 640 ), but it can be inferred from Thuc. 3 . 102 . 5 that in C6 /C5 Kalydon had parted company with the other Aitolians. Originally an independent polis , Kalydon became in C5 /C4 a member of the Early Achaian Federation and in 389 Kalydon was besieged by the Akarnanians and their allies (Xen. Hell . 4 . 6 . 1 -4 ); but in 367 / 6 Epameinondas expelled the Achaian garrison from Kalydon (Diod. 15 . 75 . 1 -2 ), whereafter the city seems to have joined the Aitolian Federation (Buckler ( 1980 ) 188 -91 ; Merker ( 1989 ); Bommeljé ( 1988 ) 310 ). A pair of damiourgoi served as eponymic officials ( IG ix² . 1 138 (C4l)); cf. Veligianni-Terzi ( 1977 ) 64 f; Sherk ( 1990 ) 260 ). In, probably, 355 , theorodokoi wereappointed to host theoroi from Epidauros ( IG iv²1 95 . 7 ). According to Thucydides, Kalydon and its neighbour Pleuron were situated near the Corinthian Gulf in the northern part of the littoral in the region called Αιολίς (Thuc. 3 . 102 . 5 ; Hsch. s.v. Αιολικοgraveν θέα µ α ). According to Strabo 10 . 2 . 21 and Plin. HN 4 . 6 , Kalydon was situated 7 . 5 Roman miles from the coast, near the river Euenos. The city possessed its own harbour at the coast (Paus. 7 . 21 . 5 ; cf. Freitag ( 2000 ) 40 -52 ). Kalydon is securely identified with the ancient settlement at the spur of Mt.Arakynthos c. 9 km east of Messolonghion; and the archaeological investigation of the remains shows that, as early as the Archaic period, the city had close cultural connections with the other centres of the Corinthian Gulf, especially Corinth. A C4 defence circuit of c. 4 km with gates and towers encloses a settlement situated on and between two hills of which the western constituted a separately fortified acropo- lis with a citadel. The walls enclosed an area of c. 25 ha.Of the ancient remains the most important are the temples of Artemis Laphria (C7 , rebuilt several times),Apollo Laphrios and Dionysos, all situated in a suburban temenos a little to the south of the city.On the archaeological evidence,see von Geisau ( 1919 ); Poulsen and Rhomaios ( 1927 ) 50 f; Dyggve et al . ( 1934 ); Dyggve ( 1948 ), ( 1951 ); Knell ( 1973 ) 448 -53 . See also AR ( 2001 -2 ) 44 -45 for the new Danish-Greek excavations at the site. The principal cult of Kalydonian Artemis Laphria goes back to the Archaic period (Paus. 4 . 31 . 7 , 7 . 18 . 8 -19 . 1 , 7 . 20 . 2 ); the sanctuary of Apollo Laphrios is attested through a C6 boundary stone ( IG ix² . 1 149 ; cf. Strabo 10 . 2 . 21 ). A cult of Zeus Soter is mentioned in Heltic manumission records ( IG ix² . 1 137 . 86 (C2m); SEG 25 621 . 8 (C2 )), and Pausanias ( 7 . 21 . 1 ) has a reference to a cult of Dionysos Kalydonios (Antonetti ( 1990 ) 241 -69 ). Stelai inscribed with public documents were set up in the sanctuary of Laphreion ( IG ix² . 1 170 . 4 (C4l/ 3 e); 186 . 6 -7 (C3l))."
149,Makynea (Makyneus),Aitolia,38.2,21.45,341,1602,"149 . Makynea (Makyneus) Map. 55 . Lat. 38 . 20 , long. 21 . 45 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: B. The toponym is Μακυνέα , ηasper (Bourguet ( 1899 ) 356 no. 2 ), Μακυνία (Strabo 10 . 2 . 21 ), Μακυacuteνεια (Steph. Byz. 429 . 9 -10 ), Μάκυνα (Archytas of Amphissa fr. 1 , Powell). The city-ethnic is Μακυνευacuteς ( IG ix² . 1 13 . vi . 22 (C3l)), Μακυacuteνιος ( SEG 25 621 . 11 f (C2s)). Makynea is not explicitly called a polis in any Archaic or Classical text. Strabo wavers between polichnion ( 10 . 2 . 4 ) and polis ( 10 . 2 . 21 ; cf. Steph. Byz. 429 . 16 ), and at 10 . 2 . 6 he criticises Hellanikos (fr. 118 ) for classifying Makynea as a polis founded in the Heroic Age. That Makynea was a polis in the Classical period is indicated by a C4 proxeny decree from Delphi, in which the individual and external use of the cityethnic is attested (Bourguet ( 1899 ) 356 no. 2 : Αιτω [ λῶι εκ Μα ] κυνέας ; cf. Sordi ( 1969 ) 356 ; Funke ( 1997 ) 161 ). Makynea seems originally to have been a Lokrian community (Plut. Mor . 294 E; cf. Lerat ( 1952 ) i. 7 , 34 f), but by C5 it had become part of Aitolia (Hohmann ( 1908 ) 17 f; Bosworth ( 1974 ) 177 ). Makynea was situated in the borderland between Aitolia and Lokris near Cape Rhion at the eastern spur of Mt. Taphiassos (modern Klokova). A suggested identification is with Palaiokastro at Mamaku, c. 3 km north-west of Rhion. Here are the remains of a fortified settlement of C4 (?)/C3 with a theatre extra muros (Woodhouse ( 1897 / 1973 ) 327 ; Lerat ( 1952 ) i. 82 -84 , 189 -91 ; Bommeljé ( 1987 ) 95 ; Bommeljé and Vroom ( 1995 ) 94 )."
150,Molykreion (Molykreus),Aitolia,38.2,21.45,575,2666,"150 . Molykreion (Molykreus) Map. 55 . Lat. 38 . 20 , long. 21 . 45 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Μολυacuteκρειον , τοgrave (Thuc. 2 . 84 . 4 , 3 . 102 . 2 ), Μολυacuteκρεια , ηasper (Hellan.( FGrHist 4 ) fr. 118 ; Ps.-Skylax 35 ; Strabo 9 . 4 . 8 , 10 . 2 . 6 ; Plut. Mor . 162 E), Μολυκρία (Polyb. 5 . 94 . 7 ; Diod.Sic. 12 . 60 . 3 ; Paus. 9 . 31 . 6 ; Steph. Byz. 455 . 12 ), Μολυacuteκριον (Paus. 5 . 3 . 6 ), or ' Ολυacuteκραι (Hecat.fr. 112 ). The city-ethnic is Μολυκρευacuteς ( IG ix² . 1 14 . 6 (C3f), 35 . 7 (C2m)) with Μολυacuteκριος and Μολυκραῖος as attested variant forms (Steph. Byz. 455 . 14 -16 ). At Ps.-Skylax 35 Molykreia is the last of three toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις εν αυτηsubiotaηtilde εισιgraveν αιasperacuteδε , where the term polis is used in the urban sense. Molykreion is explicitly called a polis at Diod. Sic. 12 . 60 . 3 (r 426 ) again in the urban sense. In C6 /C5Molykreion was within the Corinthian sphere of influence (Gschnitzer ( 1958 ) 124 f; Graham ( 1962 ), ( 1983 ) 137 ff), but by C5m it had passed into the Athenian sphere (Salmon ( 1984 ) 266 ) and from, probably, C5l it was under Aitolian influence (Benecke ( 1934 ) 8 ). Thucydides ( 3 . 102 . 2 ) describes Molykreion as a Corinthian colony that had become an Athenian satellite ( τηgraveν Κορινθίων µ εgraveν αποικίαν , Αθηναίων δεgrave υasperπήκοον ). In the sources Molykreion is located at the spur of Mt. Taphiassos (modern Varassova) (Strabo 10 . 2 . 4 , 21 ) near Cape Rion (Polyb. 5 . 94 . 7 ; Strabo 9 . 4 . 8 , 10 . 2 . 21 ; Plut. Mor . 162 E; Plin. HN 9 . 28 ; Ptol. 3 . 15 . 3 ; Steph. Byz. 545 . 13 -14 ). The phrase τοgrave ' Ρίον τοgrave Μολυκρικοgraveν (Thuc. 2 . 86 . 2 ; cf. Strabo. 8 . 2 . 3 ; Steph. Byz. 545 . 14 ) indicates that the cape was within the territory of the city, which,then,must have been situated at the cape itself (Oldfather ( 1918 ), ( 1933 ) 36 ), or a little inland by modern Velvina. Here, c. 4 km from the coast at modern Helleniko, are the remains of a C4settlement (defence circuit, temple, stoa and houses; cf. Woodhouse ( 1897 / 1973 ) 328 ; Lerat ( 1952 ) i. 84 -86 ; 188 -89 ; Bommeljé ( 1987 ) 112 ; cf. Freitag ( 2000 ) 58 -67 ). At Cape Rhion was a major sanctuary of Poseidon (Thuc. 2 . 84 . 4 ; Ps.-Skylax 35 ; Paus. 10 . 11 . 6 ; Diod. Sic. 12 . 48 . 1 ; Plut. Mor. 345 C).Molykreion was responsible for the administration of the sanctuary and the organisation of the festival associated with the sanctuary, called ταgrave ' Ρίεια ( IG iv 428 . 10 (C3 ); Plut. Mor . 162 E; cf. Klaffenbach ( 1936 ) 375 ; Pfister ( 1914 ); Knell ( 1973 ) 454 ff; Cabanes ( 1988 ) 65 ff)."

The toponym is, presumably, * Φόλα (reconstructed from the various forms of the city-ethnic). The cityethnic is either Φολαιευacuteς ( IG ii² 10482 (C4f)) or Φολάντιος ( IG ix² . 1 17 . 28 , 24 . 11 , 13 (C3s); 25 . 61 , 71 (C3s)) or Φολαtildeς ( IG ix² . 1 31 . 115 , 138 (C2f)). Phola was indisputably a polis in the Heltic period ( strategos ( IG ix² . 1 31 . 115 , 138 ), grammateus ( IG ix² . 1 25 . 61 , 71 )). The only evidence that it was already a polis in the Classical period is the name Τίτυρ µ ος Φολαιευacuteς , recorded in two Attic sepulchral inscriptions ( IG ii² 10036 (C5l-C4e), 10482 ) where the individual and external use of the ethnic indicates that it is a city-ethnic rather than a sub-ethnic; see Hansen ( 1996 ) 172 -73 , 195 ."

153,Pleuron (Pleuronios),Aitolia,38.25,21.25,464,2170,"153 . Pleuron (Pleuronios) Map. 55 . Lat. 38 . 25 , long. 21 . 25 . Size of territory: ? Type: A. The toponym is Πλευρών , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 639 ; Thuc. 3 . 102 . 5 ). The city-ethnic is Πλευρώνιος (Hom. Il . 23 . 635 ; IG ix² . 1 3 A. 17 (C3 ); Strabo 10 . 2 . 24 ). Pleuron is called a polis in the urban sense by Bacchylides at Ep . 5 . 149 -51 ; cf. Daimachos ( FGrHist 65 ) fr. 1 . The earliest epigraphical reference to a πόλις Πλευρωνίων is on a C3statue base ( IG ix² . 1 70 . 1 .) The collective internal use of the city-ethnic is attested at IG ix² . 1 70 . 1 . For the external use, see IvMag 28 . 9 = IG ix² . 1 186 . 9 (C3l). The individual and external use is attested in a proxeny decree from Delphi ( Syll. ³ 621 . 1 -2 (C2f)). In the Catalogue of Ships Pleuron is recorded as an Aitolian city ( Il . 2 . 639 ; cf. Visser ( 1997 ) 601 ff); but it can be inferred from Thuc. 3 . 102 . 5 that in C6 /C5 Pleuron had parted company with the other Aitolians. Pleuron was originally an independent polis . In C5 /C4 it became-like Kalydon-a member of the early Achaian Federation. In C4m/s it became integrated into the Aitolian Federation, as did the neighbouring poleis (Bommeljé ( 1988 ) 302 ff). The affiliation with Aitolia, however, is not explicitly attested until C3 , when citizens of Pleuron repeatedly filled federal offices (e.g. IG ix² . 1 13 . 13 -14 (C3f)). In C3s Pleuron was destroyed, but the city was soon rebuilt at a nearby but more elevated place (Strabo 10 . 2 . 4 ; cf. Ehrhardt ( 1978 ) 251 f.; Funke ( 1987 ) 94 with n. 40 ).According to Strabo 10 . 2 . 23 , old Pleuron was situated on the coast between the rivers Acheloos and Euenos near Kalydon (cf. Strabo 10 . 2 . 4 , 3 . 6 ). The settlement has not yet been found, but presumably it was close to new Pleuron, which has been identified with the ancient settlement at modern Kato Retsina, on the southern side of Mt. Arakynthos; cf. Woodhouse ( 1897 / 1973 ) 128 ff; Kirsten ( 1951 a ); Bommeljé ( 1987 ) 104 ; Antonetti ( 1990 ) 281 f; Weißl ( 1999 ) 106 ff. The only cult attested is one of Athene (Stat. Theb . 2 . 727 ; Dion. Calliphon. 57 ; cf. Antonetti ( 1990 ) 282 )."
154,Proschion (Proscheios),Aitolia,,,257,1257,"154 . Proschion (Proscheios) Map. 55 . Unlocated. Type: B. The toponym is Πρόσχιον , τό (Thuc. 3 . 102 . 5 , 106 . 1 ; Steph. Byz. 536 . 22 ) or Πρόσχεον ( IG iv²1 95 . 38 ( 355 )). The cityethnic is Πρόσχειος ( F.Delphes iii 4 213 . 2 ( 325 -275 )). Proschion is not called a polis in any ancient text, but in, probably, 355 theorodokoi were appointed to host theoroi from Epidauros ( IG iv² 95 . 38 ), and a citizen of Proschion is honoured in a Delphic proxeny decree of the early Heltic period ( supra ). Combined,the two sources indicate that Proschion was a polis , at least in the late Classical period. The individual and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in the proxeny decree from Delphi ( supra ). According to Strabo ( 10 . 2 . 6 ) Pylene-mentioned in the Homeric Catalogue of Ships ( Il . 2 . 639 )-was later moved to a more elevated place and renamed Proschion; cf.Ath. 411 A; Hsch. s.v. Πυλήνη . Proschion was situated west of Pleuron and Kalydon near the river Acheloos (Thuc. 3 . 102 . 5 , 106 . 1 ). The city must have been close to modern Aitolikon, but has not yet been securely identified; cf. Woodhouse ( 1897 / 1973 ) 138 f.; Kirsten ( 1951 b ); Antonetti ( 1990 ) 278 -80 ; Pritchett ( 1991 ) 18 ff; Strauch ( 1996 ) 356 f."

The toponym is Τριχόνειον , τό ( F.Delphes iii 4 125 . 1 (C3s); Syll . ³ 509 . 9 (C3s)), Τριχώνιον (Polyb. 5 . 7 . 8 ). The city-ethnic is Τριχονιευacuteς ( IG ix² . 1 5 . 6 (C3m)), Τριχονειευacuteς (Tod 137 . 12 ), Τριχονευacuteς ( IG ix² . 1 17 . 8 (C3f)), Τριχωνιευacuteς (Pol. 18 . 10 . 9 ), Τριχωνευacuteς (Pol. 4 . 3 . 5 ), Τριχόνιος ( IG ix² . 1 3 A. 2 ), Τρικωνιευacuteς (Paus. 2 . 37 . 3 ); for other forms, see also Steph. Byz. 638 . 8 -10 . The only author to call Trichoneion a polis is Steph. Byz. ( 638 . 8 ), but that Trichoneion was a polis and a member of the Aitolian Federation already in C4f is implied by an Athenian decree of 367 in which the Trichoneians are charged with having broken a sacred truce (Tod 137 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in this decree (l. 12 ) and internally on two stamped tiles ( IG ix² . 1 125 -6 (undated)). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in an inscription from Magnesia ( IG ix² 187 . 2 -3 (C2e)). Trichoneion was one of the most important cities in Aitolia. The identification of Trichoneion with modern Gavalou on the south bank of Lake Trichonian was first suggested by Leake ( 1835 ) 55 . In this area have been found very scanty remains of a large fortified settlement of the Classical and Heltic periods, as well as numerous tombs (Bommeljé ( 1987 ) 83 , 110 f; Antonetti ( 1990 ) 238 -240 ).

The toponym is Αacuteλπα ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) 25 iv . 120 (C3l)) or Αλόπη (Strabo 9 . 4 . 9 ; Steph. Byz. 77 . 12 ). The city-ethnic is Αλπαῖος , used in the external and individual sense in three inscriptions of C2 (Rousset ( 2002 ) 251 . 51 , 89 ; IG ix² . 1 672 and 708 ), and in the external and collective sense in Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 , where the evidence of the three Heltic inscriptions shows that Αλπαῖοι is a convincing conjecture for MSS ' Ολπαῖοι . Apart from Steph. Byz. 77 . 12 , Alpa is not called a polis in any source, and the main reason for interpreting Αλπαῖος as a city-ethnic and including Alpa in this inventory of Archaic and Classical poleis is the C3list of theorodokoi , interpreted retrospectively,and combined with Thucydides' information at 3 . 101 . 2 that,in 426 , the Alpaioi had to provide hostages to the Peloponnesian League alongside a number of other Lokrian communities,three of which were presumably poleis (Amphissa (no. 158 ), Chaleion (no. 159 ) and Oianthea (no. 166 )) and the others of which may have been. The passage shows that Alpa must have been a political community,and may perhaps have been a polis . Lerat (( 1952 ) i. 13 -15 and 212 -13 ) showed that the Alpaioi must have been settled in the neighbourhood of Physkeis and Phaistinos, but he refrained from placing Alpa on the map.

158,Amphissa (Amphisseus),West Lokris,38.3,22.2,1047,4899,"158 . Amphissa (Amphisseus) Map. 55 . Lat. 38 . 30 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Αacute µ φισσα , ηasper (Hdt. 8 . 32 . 2 ; Dem. 18 . 143 ; Aeschin. 3 . 125 ; Ps.Skylax 36 ; IG iv² . 1 95 . 4 (C4m)) or, in inscriptions, sometimes Αacuteνφισσα ( SEG 39 441 (C3 )). The city-ethnic is Α µ φισσευacuteς (Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 ; Dem. 18 . 150 ; Aeschin. 3 . 113 ; CID ii 118 . 5 (C4f)) or, in inscriptions, sometimes Ανφισσευacuteς ( CID v index s.v.). Apart from the feminine Α µ φισσίς , Α µ φισσαία is also attested ( IG ii² 8088 (C3l)). Both the toponym and the ethnic may have the geminate σσ - written simplex ( CID ii 31 . 79 (C4m)). Amphissa is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 8 . 32 . 2 and Ps.-Skylax 36 . That it was a polis in the political sense as well is indicated by the appointment of an Epidaurian theorodokos in Amphissa ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 4 (C4m)), the presence of Amphissaians among the Delphic naopoioi ( CID ii 31 . 79 (C4m)) and hieromnemones ( CID ii 43 . 23 ( 341 )), and by the Amphiktyonic League's declaration of war upon Amphissa in 340 / 39 (Aeschin. 3 . 128 -29 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in an inscription of C2 ( BCH 126 ( 2002 ) 85 ; IG ix² . 1 750 . 29 ) and on Heltic coins (Head, HN ² 337 ), and externally in Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 and in a Delphic dedicatory inscription of C4 -C3 ( BCH 73 ( 1949 ) 258 ). The individual use is attested externally in Delphic C4 inscriptions ( CID ii 118 . 5 , 31 . 79 ) and internally in a first century ad inscription from Amphissa ( IG ix² . 1 755 . 4 ). The territory of Amphissa bordered on that of Myania (no. 164 ) to the south (Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 ). T o the north it extended as far as the Phokian poleis , as appears from the sources for the conflict of 395 ( Hell . Oxy . 21 . 2 -3 ; Paus. 3 . 9 . 9 ; contra Xen. Hell . 3 . 5 . 3 ; cf. Rousset ( 2002 ) 162 -64 ). T o the east the C4frontier with Delphi (no. 177 ) is mentioned at Plut. Mor . 249 F (r 354 or 353 ). To the south-east the territory of Amphissa was contiguous with the sacred land of Apollo. The occupation of the hiera chora at the beginning of the Fourth Sacred War of 340 -338 (Dem. 18 . 150 ; Aeschin. 3 . 113 ) was followed by a redrawing of the frontier to the detriment of the Amphissaians (Rousset ( 2002 ) 86 . 8 . 30 -31 (r 335 / 4 )). From these Classical sources, as well as from later documents, it appears that Amphissa possessed a larger territory than the other Lokrian poleis . In 480 Amphissa served as a place of refuge for the Phokians and the Delphians (Hdt. 8 . 32 . 2 , 36 . 2 ). Amphissa is then not mentioned again in the sources until the Peloponnesian War (on the reference to the Amphissaians at Diod. 12 . 42 . 4 (r 431 ), see Lerat ( 1952 ) ii. 37 ). Among the West Lokrians, who in 426 were allied with Athens, the Amphissaians were the first to change sides and join the Spartans (Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 ). In the Third Sacred War, the Amphissaians were prepared to relieve Delphi from Phokian occupation (Diod. 16 . 24 . 4 (r 356 )), but soon had to submit to the Phokians (Diod. 16 . 33 . 3 (r 354 or 353 )). The Fourth Sacred War ( 340 -338 ) was provoked by the Amphissaians (Aeschin. 3 . 113 -29 ; Dem. 18 . 140 -59 ), and ended with Philip's conquest of the city (Polyaen. 4 . 2 . 8 ) and the exile of some of the citizens.Aeschin. 3 . 129 states that the Amphissaians recalled the exiles soon after, and had their opponents exiled instead, but according to Diod. 18 . 56 . 5 , the exile of the Amphissaians who had caused the Sacred War was still effective in 319 . However, in spite of Strabo 9 . 4 . 8 (cf. 9 . 3 . 4 ), it seems that the city was not destroyed in 338 (Lerat ( 1952 ) ii. 53 -54 ). It is apparent from the Amphiktyonic lists of 341 -323 that Amphissa was not a member of the C4m federation of the Hesperian Lokrians which had its centre at Physkeis ( supra ). During this period an Amphissaian and a Hesperian took turns serving as the hieromnemon of the West Lokrians (Lerat ( 1952 ) ii. 57 -60 ; Lefèvre ( 1998 ) 79 , 295 -96 ). The mythical founder of Amphissa was Andraimon (Arist. fr. 569 ), whose tomb could still be seen in Amphissa in the second century ad (Paus. 10 . 38 . 5 ). Nothing is known about the political institutions of Amphissa prior to C2 . In C4m the Amphissaians appointed a theorodokos to host the theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 4 ). In 321 , when Amphissa was besieged by the Aitolians (Diod. 18 . 38 . 2 ), the city must have been fortified. There are still remains of the ancient acropolis wall, built partly in Lesbian masonry and enclosing an area of 1 ha. Furthermore, excavations have revealed sections of what may be a C4s defence circuit enclosing the town ( ArchDelt 37 ( 1982 ) 208 -10 , 44 ( 1989 ) Chron . 190 , 198 -99 , 50 ( 1995 ) Chron . 358 , 51 ( 1996 ) Chron. 328 ."
159,Chaleion (Chaleieus),West Lokris,38.2,22.2,543,2477,"159 . Chaleion (Chaleieus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 20 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 ? Type: A. The toponym is Χαλειόν ( IG ix² . 1 717 . 7 (C5m); BCH 45 ( 1921 ) 23 iv . 69 (C3l)) or, once, Χάλαιον (Hecat. fr. 113 ) or, in late inscriptions, Χαλεόν , Χαληόν ( CID v 862 , 1115 (C1 )). The city-ethnic is Χαλειευacuteς ( IG ix² . 1 718 . 47 (C5f), 717 . 7 (C5m)). Variant forms are Χαλευacuteς ( IG ix² . 1 738 (C5 )), Χαλεευacuteς ( BCH 92 ( 1968 ) 30 (C4l-C3e)), Χαληευacuteς ( CID v20 ( 198 / 7 )), Χαλεάτης ( CID v 1249 (first century ad )) or Χαλαῖος (Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 ). Chaleion is attested as a polis both in the urban sense (Hecat. fr. 113 ; IG ix² . 1 717 . 4 (C5m)) and in the political sense ( BCH 92 ( 1968 ) 30 (C4l-C3e) = IG ix² . 1 739 ). The citizen is called astos ( IG ix² . 1 717 . 14 ). The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested in the treaty with Oianthea ( IG ix² . 1 717 (C5m)) and on a C5 weight ( IG ix² . 1 738 ); the collective and external use is attested at Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 . The individual use is attested both internally ( IG ix² . 1 721 C. 5 , 7 (C3 )) and externally ( BCH 92 ( 1968 ) 30 . 14 (C4l-C3e), Delphi). The inscription, BCH 92 ( 1968 ) 30 , which concerns the ownership of landed property in one polis by citizens from another polis , shows that Chaleion bordered on Tritea (no. 168 ). The treaty with Oianthea ( IG ix 2 . 1 717 ) mentions the name of the territory ( 1 : Χαλείς ) and refers to the harbour of the city ( 4 : λι µ ένος τ ˜ ο καταgrave πόλις ). Apart from IG ix² . 1 718 -attesting to the participation of Chaleion in the C5f colonisation of Naupaktos (no. 165 )-the best source for the status of Chaleion in C5 is the treaty with Oianthea (no. 166 ) IG ix² . 1 717 ; see Gauthier ( 1972 ) 222 -25 , 242 -44 , 286 -92 ). It regulates the presence of Chaleian metics ( 6 : µ εταΓaltοικ ˜ εν ) in Oianthea, and vice versa. The inscription refers to proxenoi , xenodikai , damiourgoi , and to institutions of an aristocratic type, e.g. that jurors are to be appointed aristindan . The Chaleian board of damiourgoi is also attested in a C5f dedication to an unnamed hero ( IG ix² . 1 720 ). On the basis of the epigraphical evidence, Lerat (( 1952 ) i. 198 -205 ) has shown that Chaleion was situated at modern Galaxidi. The defence circuit at this site encloses an area of 8 ha and dates from C4l or C3e (ibid. 152 -58 ; ArchDelt 33 ( 1978 ) Chron . 147 -48 , 44 ( 1989 ) Chron . 201 and 204 )."
160,Hyaia (Hyaios) (with Polis),West Lokris,,,523,2592,"160 . *Hyaia (Hyaios) (with Polis) Map 55 . Hyaia unlocated and not in Barr .; Polis located at lat. 38 . 25 , long. 22 . 05 , but see infra . Type: C. The toponym is ' Υαία (Steph. Byz. 644 . 4 : ' Υαία , πόλις Λοκρῶν τῶν ' Οζολῶν . τοgrave εθνικοgraveν ' Υαῖος . Θουκυδίδης τρίτΩsubiotaω ( ' Υαίους at Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 )). In this note the toponym is probably generated by Stephanos from the ethnic in Thucydides and has no authority. Hyaia is attested as a polis in Heltic sources only ( infra ). The collective and external use of the city-ethnic is attested at Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 ; for the individual and external use, see F.Delphes iii . 3 221 (C3l); SEG 44 438 . 6 (C2 ); IG ix² . 1 34 . 18 (C2 ). Among the Lokrian peoples who were in contact with the Spartan Eurylochos in 426 , Thucydides mentions the Hyaioi,'who did not submit to giving hostages until he had taken their village called Polis' ( ' Υαῖοι ουκ έδοσαν οasper µ ήρους πριgraveν αυτῶν ειaspertildeλον κώ µ ην Πόλιν όνο µ α έχουσαν , 3 . 101 . 2 ). This, our only early source, is open to several interpretations: (a) most of the Hyaians lived scattered around a single village which they called Polis; (b) the Hyaians were settled in a number of villages, one of which was called Polis; (c) the Hyaians were settled in one town ( polis ) plus one or more villages ( komai ), one of which was called Polis. Irrespective of which of the three interpretations one prefers, it can be assumed that the name Polis is derived from the term polis in the sense of akropolis (Hansen ( 1996 ) 36 ). In the Heltic period the Hyaioi and the Polieis were distinct political communities, and each was a polis : c. 200 the πόλις ' Υαίων set up a statue in Thermos ( IG ix² . 1 71 a), in C3e a ∆ράκων Πολιευacuteς served as hipparch of the Aitolian Federation ( IG ix² . 1 8 . 12 -13 ; cf. 17 . 5 ), and in 208 the Πολιεῖς were among those who recognised the Leukophryeneia of Magnesia on the Maiander ( I.Magnesia 28 . 13 ). If the Polieis of the Heltic period can be connected with the kome called Polis at Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 , the inference is that Polis had changed its status from kome to polis . A further inference is that the polis of the Hyaians did not have its urban centre at the settlement which in 426 was called Polis. Lerat (( 1952 ) i. 197 , ii. 239 ) refrained from locating the Hyaians and Polis. Polis was tentatively located at modern Glypha by Philippson and Kirsten ( 1951 ) 1391 -96 and ( 1958 ) 319 n. 2 , 636 n. 19 ; accepted in Barr . for no good reason.As the evidence stands, Polis ought to be left unlocated."
161,Hypnia (Hypneus),West Lokris,38.25,22.2,247,1213,"161 . Hypnia (Hypneus) Map. 55 . Lat. 38 . 25 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. The toponym is ' Υπνία , ηasper ( F.Delphes iii . 4 352 . ii . 4 ( c . 190 )). The city-ethnic is ' Υπνιευacuteς ( F.Delphes iii . 4 352 . ii . 24 ). In Steph. Byz. 335 . 17 the toponym is /acuteΙπνος , ' Ιπνέα , possibly generated from the city-ethnic ' Ιπνέας (acc. plur.) at Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 , where, however, ' Υπνέας is a plausible conjecture for MSS ' Ιπνέας . Hypnia is explicitly called a polis in the C2e sympoliteia with neighbouring Myania (no. 164 ; F.Delphes iii . 4 352 . ii . 4 -5 ). The treaty records the name of the territory ( ' Υπνιάς , ii . 24 -25 ), and refers to troops and officials in Hypnia ( ii . 14 -16 ). The Heltic evidence should be combined, retrospectively, with Thucydides' information at 3 . 101 . 2 that, in 426 , the Hypnians had to provide hostages to the Peloponnesian League alongside a number of other Lokrian communities, three of which were presumably poleis (Amphissa (no. 158 ), Chaleion (no. 159 ) and Oianthea (no. 166 )) and the others of which may have been. The passage shows that the Hypnians must have been a political community,and may perhaps have been a polis ."
162,(Issioi),West Lokris,,,232,1188,"162 . (Issioi) Map. 55 . Unlocated. Type: C. Only the cityethnic is known, viz . /acuteΙσσιος , attested in numerous Heltic inscriptions ( IG ix² . 1 17 A. 56 (C3f), 638 . 13 ; CID v 17 , 22 , 104 ; SEG 41 . 514 ?). In Steph. Byz. 304 . 17 the toponym ' Ησσός is probably generated from the city-ethnic ' Ησσίους (acc. plur.) at Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 , where, however, ' Ισσίους is a plausible conjecture for MSS ' Ησσίους . Apart from Steph. Byz. 304 . 17 , the Issioi are not described as a polis in any source, and the main reason for interpreting /acuteΙσσιος as a city-ethnic and including the Issioi in this inventory of Archaic and Classical poleis is Thucydides' information at 3 . 101 . 2 that, in 426 , the Issioi had to provide hostages to the Peloponnesian League alongside a number of other Lokrian communities, three of which were presumably poleis (Amphissa (no. 158 ), Chaleion (no. 159 ) and Oianthea (no. 166 )) and the others may have been. The passage shows that the Issians must have been a political community, and may perhaps have been a polis . The Issioi were probably settled between Tolophon (no. 167 ) and Oianthea (no. 166 ) (Lerat ( 1952 ) i. 32 -34 , 212 -13 )."
163,(Messapioi),West Lokris,,,233,1239,"163 . (Messapioi) Map. 55 . Unlocated. Type: [A]. Only the city-ethnic is known, viz . Μεσσάπιος , attested at Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 in the collective and external sense, and in the individual and external sense in a single Delphic inscription recording a West Lokrian treasurer of 337 named Χαιρέας ' Ορθαγόρ [ α Μ ] εσ [ σ ] άπιος ( CID ii 74 . i . 51 ). The list of treasurers is headed by the stipulation τοgraveν τα µ ίαν αποπέ µ πειν ταgraveς πόλεις (l. 4 ), an indication that the Messapioi were a polis in the political sense. There is no longer any basis for the traditional view (cf.Lerat ( 1952 ) i. 35 ) that Messapioi was the earlier name of the community called Physkeis from C3 onwards (Rousset ( 2002 ) 18 ). The attestation of a Messapian treasurer of 337 / 6 should be combined, retrospectively, with Thucydides' information at 3 . 101 . 2 that, in 426 , the Messapians had to provide hostages to the Peloponnesian League alongside a number of other Lokrian communities, three of which were presumably poleis (Amphissa (no. 158 ), Chaleion (no. 159 ) and Oianthea (no. 166 )) and the others of which may have been. The passage shows that the Messapians must have been a political community,and may perhaps have been a polis ."
164,Myania (Myaneus),West Lokris,38.3,22.2,344,1617,"164 . Myania (Myaneus) Map. 55 . Lat. 38 . 30 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. The toponym is Μυανία , ηasper ( F.Delphes iii . 4 352 . iii . 15 ( c. 190 ); CID v 631 , 632 ( 138 / 7 )) or Μυονία (Paus. 10 . 38 . 8 ; Steph. Byz. 462 . 9 ) or, once, Μυacuteων (Steph. Byz. 465 . 17 ). The city-ethnic is, apparently, Μυαtildeνες (pl.), on an ancient shield dedicated to Zeus in Olympia and quoted by Pausanias at 6 . 19 . 4 -5 ( Μυάνων ) and 10 . 38 . 8 ( Μυαtildeνες ). The form Μυανεῖς ( Μυανευacuteς ) appears in F.Delphes iii . 4 352 . ii . 23 -24 , and the Attic-Ionic form Μυονεῖς ( Μυονευacuteς ) at Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 . Myania is attested as a polis in the sympoliteia with Hypnia (no. 161 ) of c. 190 ( F.Delphes iii . 4 352 . ii . 12 -13 ). The main reason for classifying Myania as a polis in the Archaic and Classical periods is Thucydides' information at 3 . 101 . 2 that, in 426 , the Myonians had to provide hostages to the Peloponnesian League alongside a number of other Lokrian communities, three of which were presumably poleis (Amphissa (no. 158 ), Chaleion (no. 159 ) and Oianthea (no. 166 )) and the others of which may have been. The passage shows that the Myonians must have been a political community, and may perhaps have been a polis . The persistence of the toponym down to the sixteenth century has made it possible to locate Myania at modern Agia Efthymia, where there are remains of an ancient cemetery and of a defence circuit enclosing an area of c. 8 ha (Lerat ( 1952 ) i. 78 -80 , 170 -72 ) and at least in part to be dated to C4 ( ArchDelt 44 ( 1989 ) Chron . 214 )."
165,Naupaktos (Naupaktios),West Lokris,38.2,21.5,1020,4833,"165 . Naupaktos (Naupaktios) Map. 55 . Lat. 38 . 20 , long. 21 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 ? Type: A. The toponym is Ναυacuteπακτος , ηasper ( IG ix² . 1 718 (C5f); IG iv² 1 95 . 6 (C4m); Thuc. 1 . 103 . 3 ; Isoc. 12 . 94 ; Dem. 9 . 34 ). The city-ethnic is, once, ΝαΓaltπάκτιος ( IG ix² . 1 718 . 40 ), but elsewhere in the same inscription (ll. 2 , 14 , 16 , etc.) and in all other sources Ναυπάκτιος ( IvO 259 (C5l?); Thuc. 2 . 92 . 3 ). Naupaktos is called a polis in the urban sense by Thuc. 3 . 102 . 5 and Ps.Skylax 35 . For polis in the political sense, see IG ix² . 1 609 . 10 , a law of C6l, often assigned to Naupaktos (Koerner ( 1993 ) no. 47 ), though the ascription is far from certain ( Nomima i no. 44 ). At Thuc. 2 . 9 . 1 and 4 , the Messenians in Naupaktos are subsumed under the heading poleis and listed among the allies of Athens in 431 . See also Diod. 15 . 66 . 5 (r 460 / 59 or 456 / 5 ), 12 . 48 . 1 (r 429 ). The city-ethnic is used in the collective and external sense in IG ix² . 1 718 . 2 , etc.; IvO 259 . 1 . The individual use is attested from C4s onwards, both externally ( SEG 26 697 (C4 ); IG ix² . 1 3 A. 17 ; F.Delphes iii . 4 12 . 3 (C3f)) and internally ( IG ix² . 1 613 . 5 (C3l)). The territory is called Ναυπακτία (Aesch. Suppl . 262 ; Thuc. 3 . 102 . 2 ). Its frontiers are virtually unknown (see introduction supra ). In the Heltic period the Bouttioi, situated c. 5 km north of Naupaktos,are attested as a dependency of Naupaktos (Lerat ( 1952 ) i. 20 -23 , 76 , 93 -96 , 191 -92 ). On the frontier between Lokris and Aitolia north of Naupaktos, see supra 391 . An Archaic law on landed property ( IG ix² . 1 609 ) concerns the region of Naupaktos or the borderland towards Aitolia, but the ascription of the law to the city of Naupaktos is uncertain ( supra ). According to Ps.-Skymnos 479 , Naupaktos was a Dorian polis founded in the Heroic Age by Temenos. In C5f contingents of colonists were sent to Naupaktos from East Lokris and Chaleion (no. 159 ) ( IG ix² . 1 718 = ML 20 = Koerner ( 1993 ) no. 47 ). In 456 / 5 the Athenians took Naupaktos away from the West Lokrians and gave it to Messenian exiles from the Peloponnese (Thuc. 1 . 103 . 3 ; Diod. 11 . 84 . 7 ; cf. Hornblower ( 1991 ) 160 ). The Messenians and the Naupaktians formed a sympoliteia ( IG ix² . 1 fasc. 3 ix ; see also Nielsen ( 2002 ) 60 n. 87 ; for a C2echo of this sympoliteia , see SEG 41 331 and BE 1994 no. 341 ); they won several victories: one over Kalydon (no. 148 ), commemorated at Delphi ( BCH 106 ( 1982 ) 196 -99 , 204 ), and one over the Akarnanians and Oiniadai (no. 130 ), commemorated in Olympia ( IvO 259 (C5l?); Paus. 5 . 26 . 1 ). The Messenians of Naupaktos remained loyal to Athens during the Peloponnesian War (Thuc. 2 . 9 . 4 ; Diod. 12 . 48 . 1 ) and provided strong contingents of hoplites, testifying to the large size of the population ( 500 hoplites in 427 (Thuc. 3 . 75 . 1 ), 600 in 410 (Diod. 13 . 48 . 6 )). In 400 , after the end of the war, the Messenians were expelled, and Naupaktos was given back to the Lokrians (Diod. 14 . 34 . 2 ; Paus. 4 . 26 . 2 , 10 . 38 . 10 ). Twice in C4 Naupaktos became an Achaian dependency, first between 389 and 367 , and then again during the Third Sacred War and down to 338 (Diod. 15 . 75 . 2 ; Dem. 9 . 34 ; Lerat ( 1952 ) ii. 44 -45 , 49 ). In that year Naupaktos was captured by Philip II, who killed the Achaian garrison and gave the city to the Aitolians (Theopomp. fr. 235 ; Strabo 9 . 4 . 7 ; cf. Lerat ( 1952 ) ii. 54 -55 ; Freitag ( 2000 ) 87 ). IG ix² . 1 718 contains some information about the Lokrian political institutions in C5f. The inscription regulates the status and rights of the new colonists from Naupaktos,mentions the laws of Naupaktos, and refers to an official called archos , and the agora as the place where proclamations take place. IG ix² . 1 609 refers to damiourgoi and to three types of assembly: preiga , polis and apoklesia , but the ascription to Naukratos remains doubtful. The divinities attested in the Classical period are Athena Polias (unpublished sympoliteia , cf. supra ) and Apollo (Thuc. 2 . 91 . 1 ). In C4m Naupaktos appointed a theorodokos to host theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 6 ). Naupaktos is the only Lokrian city that we know for certain was fortified in C5 . Thuc. 3 . 102 . 2 -4 distinguishes an unfortified suburb ( proasteion ) from the 'big wall' ( µ έγα τεῖχος ), which ought to be a wall enclosing the town below the acropolis. The harbour seems to have been fortified too (Lerat ( 1952 ) i. 89 ). Remains of the ancient fortifications and other buildings have been unearthed during numerous excavations, but there is not yet a chronologically organised synthesis that indicates which of the urban remains can be dated to the Archaic and Classical periods."

Ευανθευacuteς is an alternative form attested in the Heltic period ( CID v 17 (C2f); IG ix² . 1 709 a. 2 (C2m)); cf. Lerat ( 1952 ) i. 41 -44 . Oianthea is called a polis in the urban sense at Hecat. fr. 113 ; IG ix² . 1 717 . 4 (C5m) and Ps.-Skylax 36 . The earliest attestation of Oianthea as a polis in the political sense is in a C2manumission inscription ( IG ix² . 1 709 a. 2 ); that it was a polis community in the Classical period as well is apparent from the treaty with Chaleion of C5m ( IG ix² . 1 717 ) and the attestation of a C4m theorodokos to host theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² 95 . 5 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on Heltic coins (Head, HN ² 338 ) and externally at Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 . The individual and external use is found on a C7 -C6 cenotaph of a Korkyrean proxenos (ML 4 . 2 ); patris ( gaia ) is found ibid. The treaty with Chaleion (no. 159 ) ( IG ix² . 1 717 (C5m)) mentions the name of the territory ( 2 : Οιανθίς ) and refers to the harbour of the city ( 4 : λι µ ένος τ ˜ ο καταgrave πόλιν ). Apart from this treaty-which concerns the presence of Oianthean citizens in Chaleion and vice versa-little is known of the history of Oianthea in the Classical period. In 426 Oianthea had to provide hostages to the Peloponnesian League (Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 ). C. 373 the city was ruled by a tyrant (Polyaen. 8 . 46 ). Oianthea's relations with the Greek world are attested, for the Archaic period, by the proxenos buried in Korkyra (ML 4 ; see Nomima i no. 34 ) and, for the Classical period, by the theorodokos of C4m ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 5 ). According to Plut. Mor . 294 E, the city was founded by the hero Lokros. Plutarch's account may stem from an Aristotelian politeia (no. 104 , Gigon)."

The toponym is Τολφών ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) 23 . iv . 70 (C3l); CID v560 , 564 (C2m); IG ix² . 1 715 (C2m)) or Τολοφών , ηasper (Dion. Calliphon. 66 , Marcotte; Steph. Byz. 628 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is Τολοφώνιος , attested at Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 , where it is used in the collective and external sense. The individual use is attested both internally ( IG ix² . 1 715 (C2m): Τολφώνιος ) and externally at Delphi (Rousset ( 2002 ) 251 . 14 (C2 )). Tolophon is attested as a polis in the political sense in an inscription of C2m ( IG ix² . 1 715 ) found in situ at Vidavi/Marmara and thus identifying the site. The reason for including Tolophon in this inventory of Archaic and Classical poleis is Thucydides' information at 3 . 101 . 2 that, in"
168,Tritea (Triteus),West Lokris,38.2,22.2,300,1470,"168 . Tritea (Triteus) Map. 55 . Lat. 38 . 20 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: A. The toponym is Τριτέα , ηasper ( BCH 92 ( 1968 ) 30 . 8 -9 (C4l-C3e) = IG ix² . 1 739 ). The city-ethnic is Τριτευacuteς (ibid. 14 ). Tritea is attested as a polis in the political sense (ibid. 14 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally at Thuc. 3 . 101 . 2 and BCH 92 ( 1968 ) 30 . 14 (C4l-C3e). For the individual and external use, see IG ix² . 1 31 . 148 , 174 , 177 ( 214 / 13 ), and CID iv 96 ( 204 / 3 ). The treaty between Chaleion (no. 159 ) and Triteia ( BCH 92 ( 1968 ) 30 , Delphi), which concerns the ownership of landed property in one polis by citizens from the other polis , shows that Tritea bordered on Chaleion,and that both communities were poleis . For C5 we have Thucydides' information at 3 . 101 . 2 that, in 426 , the Triteians had to provide hostages to the Peloponnesian League alongside a number of other Lokrian communities,three of which were presumably poleis (Amphissa (no. 158 ), Chaleion (no. 159 ) and Oianthea (no. 166 )) and the others of which may have been. The passage shows that Tritea must have been a political community, and may perhaps have been a polis . These sources as well as the manumission inscriptions from Delphi show that Tritea was situated at modern Pendeoria, where there is an undated defence circuit enclosing an area of c. 1 ha (Lerat ( 1952 ) i. 51 -52 , 145 -49 , 211 ). ## II.

169,Abai (Abaios),Phokis,38.35,22.55,752,3565,"169 . Abai (Abaios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 35 , long. 22 . 55 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type:A.The toponym is Αacuteβαι , αιasper (Hdt. 8 . 33 ; Diod. 16 . 58 . 4 ; F.Delphes iii . 2 230 . 5 (C2s)) or Αβαί (Kallisthenes ( FGrHist 124 ) fr. 11 ) or Αacuteβα / Αacuteβη (Arist.fr. 617 ; Hdn. iii . 1 308 . 24 -26 ; Steph. Byz. 1 . 1 ) or Αacuteβαντα (Hsch. Α 65 ). The city-ethnic is Αβαῖος ( IG ix . 1 78 . 2 (C3l); Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 ). Abai is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 8 . 33 in connection with Xerxes' invasion of Phokis in 480 , when Abai was burnt to the ground and, retrospectively, at Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 (r 346 ). The collective and external use of the cityethnic is attested in a letter of Philip V to the Abaians ( IG ix . 1 78 . 2 ) and, retrospectively, in Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 (rC4m); cf. also 10 . 35 . 4 . The individual and external use is attested in a C2s Delphic manumission ( F.Delphes iii . 2 230 . 7 ) and in a first century ad proxeny decree ( F.Delphes iii . 4 443 ). Abai is commonly mentioned in literary sources in connection with the oracle of Apollo situated in its territory (Hdt. 8 . 27 . 5 (rC6 ?); for the date, see Ellinger ( 1993 ) 17 -22 ; Hdt. 1 . 46 . 2 (rC6m), 8 . 33 , 8 . 134 ; Soph. OT 899 ; Paus. 4 . 32 . 5 (r 371 ); Diod. 16 . 58 (r 347 / 6 ); Paus. 10 . 35 . 1 -5 ). The location of the sanctuary is unknown (Ellinger ( 1993 ) 25 , contra Yorke ( 1896 ) 298 -302 ; McInerney ( 1999 ) 288 -89 ). Abaios as the epithet of Apollo is attested in Hsch. Α 50 and confirmed by onomastic material (Sittig ( 1911 ) 52 ). The identity between the epithet and the city-ethnic may be the explanation of the use of the toponym to designate the sanctuary itself (Strabo 9 . 3 . 13 ). There can be no doubt that Abai was a member of the Phokian koinon , although there is no explicit attestation. In the idiom ες Αacuteβας ταgraveς Φωκέων (Hdt. 1 . 46 . 2 (rC6m) and 8 . 134 . 1 (rC5f)) the reference to the Phokians indicates location rather than political status, and that applies also to Kallisthenes ( FGrHist 124 ) fr. 11 . On the other hand, Pausanias' account of the fate of Abai in 346 implies that Abai belonged to the Phokian koinon . Pausanias asserts that Abai avoided the dioikismos because it participated neither in the occupation of the sanctuary in Delphi nor in the war ( 10 . 3 . 2 ). Diodorus, on the other hand, tells us that in 347 the Phokians built a phrourion on what was undoubtedly Abaian territory ( 16 . 58 . 4 ; cf. Dassios ( 1995 ), ( 1992 ) no. 43 ). The possible inferences from these two pieces of information are (a) that in 347 the Abaians no longer had control of their own territory, or (b) that Abai's participation in the war was purely defensive, or (c) that Abai's pacifist attitude is a later rewriting of history. The site is enclosed by a fortification wall in polygonal masonry,a part of it in Lesbian style. Both the acropolis and the lower town were fortified, and the walls enclosed an area of c. 16 ha.The wall enclosing the acropolis may be older than that enclosing the lower town, but the dates, based on style and a priori historical arguments,are disputed (Yorke ( 1896 ) 294 -96 : C5 or earlier; Scranton ( 1941 ) 160 : C6 ; Fossey ( 1986 ) 78 -79 , 122 -27 : C5 ; Winter ( 1971 ) 103 : the wall enclosing the lower town not earlier than C4 ). Pausanias mentions an agora and a theatre both of ancient construction ( 10 . 35 . 4 : κατασκευηtildeς αρχαίας ). The remains found in the neigh- bouring sanctuary and in the cemetery date back to C7 (Fossey ( 1986 ) 164 -65 )."

(with a query) locates it at modern Karakolithos, although in the directory this site is named 'Bania' , a modern site not marked on the map itself; cf. supra 408 , s. v. karakolithos , and see infra ). Size of territory: ? Type: A. The toponym is unattested and reconstructed from the cityethnic. The city-ethnic is Αιολιδευacuteς , attested at Hdt. 8 . 35 . 1 in its collective and external use. The πόλις of the Αιολιδεῖς is known exclusively from Herodotos' account at 8 . 35 . 1 of Xerxes' march in 480 from Phanoteus towards Delphi when *Aiolidai was burnt to the ground: Καιgrave γαgraveρ τῶν Πανοπέων τηgraveν πόλιν ενέπρησαν καιgrave ∆αυλίων Αιολιδέων ( Αιολίδων MS P).Tillard ( 1911 ) 64 demonstrated that Valckenaer's conjecture Λιλαιέων must be rejected for topographical reasons. At Mor . 418 A Plutarch mentions a group of persons in Delphi perhaps called the Αιολάδαι , but there is no reason to connect them with the Αιολιδεῖς attested in Herodotos (Rousset ( 2002 ) 28 ). At Hdt. 8 . 35 . 1 polis is used in the urban sense, but the use of the city-ethnic instead of the toponym indicates that the political sense is a connotation; see Hansen ( 2000 ) 176 , 205 . The passage from Herodotos shows that the polis of the Aiolideis must have been situated between Daulis and Delphi. Assuming that the polis was fortified, one would have to exclude the site of Phokikon, where, however, some epitaphs of the Archaic period have been found (Fossey ( 1986 ) 57 ). On the other hand, *Aiolidai must then be identified with one of the three sites found along this route: (a) Rosoufi ( = Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 68 ), the remains of which, however, are poorly attested; or (b) Kastro-Zemenou (McInerney ( 1999 ) 304 = Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 112 ), but the remains do not look like a permanent settlement and the alleged Archaic remains are questionable; (c) Kastro Teresi, where no remains of the Archaic period have been found (Tillard ( 1911 ) 66 -68 = *Aiolidai; Fossey ( 1986 ) 54 -56 = Phlygonion; Rousset ( 2002 ) 43 n. 46 = Trachis). In any case, one must abandon the identification of *Aiolidai with the remains at Bania (Schober ( 1924 ) 22 ). This site is to be identified with ancient Phlygonion (no. 191 ), and there is no basis for assuming a change of name from *Aiolidai to Phlygonion. To conclude, the location of *Aiolidai remains unresolved."
171,Ambryssos (Ambryssios),Phokis,37.55,22.4,587,2702,"171 . Ambryssos (Ambryssios) Map 55 . Lat. 37 . 55 , long. 22 . 40 . Size of territory: probably 2 . Type: B. The toponym is Αacute µ βρυσ ( σ ) ος , ηasper ( SGDI 2147 . 1 (C2m); Strabo 9 . 3 . 13 ; SGDI 2314 . 1 (C2l); Polyb. 4 . 25 . 2 (rC3s)). In late sources the toponym is sometimes /acuteΑ µ βροσσος ( IG ix . 1 12 . 2 -3 (third century ad ); Paus. 10 . 36 . 3 ) or /acuteΑ µ βροσσός (schol.Ap.Rhod. A 54 ) or Αacute µ φρυσος (Steph. Byz. 91 . 9 ). The city-ethnic is Α µ βρυacuteσ ( σ ) ιος ( SGDI 2125 . 2 (C2e), 2147 . 5 -6 (C2s) or Α µ φρυacuteσιος (Lycoph. Alex . 900 ) or, in late sources only, Α µ βρόσσιος ( F.Delphes iii . 3 431 . 6 (C1m)) or Α µ βρυσσευacuteς ( F.Delphes iii . 2 136 . 24 (C2m)) or Α µ βρο / ωσσευacuteς ( IG ix . 1 18 . 12 (third century ad ); Paus. 10 . 1 . 8 (rC6 ?); IG ix . 1 18 . 12 (third century ad )). The earliest attestation of Ambryssos as a polis is of C2 ( IG ix . 1 10 . 1 -2 ), but it is retrospectively attested as a polis in the urban sense at Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 , where it is listed among the Phokian cities dioikised in 346 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in IG ix . 1 10 . 1 -2 . The individual and external use is attested in a proxeny decree of C3 ( IG ix . 1 1 . 4 ) and in Pausanias' account of the C6 (?) war between the Phokians and the Thessalians, where ' Ροῖος Α µ βροσσευacuteς was the general of the Phokian infantry (Paus. 10 . 1 . 7 -8 ). If one accepts the historicity of this war (but cf. Ellinger ( 1993 ) 17 -22 , contra Pritchett ( 1996 )) we have here the oldest attestation of Ambryssos as a polis . By C2s Ambryssos and Phlygonion (no. 191 ) had formed a sympoliteia with Phlygonion as the subordinate party, and a preserved delimitation of frontiers ( F.Delphes iii . 2 136 ) shows that, at least then, the two communities bordered on Delphi (Rousset ( 2002 ) 128 , 140 , 155 -60 ). The dioikismos suffered in 346 shows that Ambryssos belonged to the Phokian koinon . Pausanias tells us that the defence circuit he saw had been built by the Thebans when they were at war with Philip II of Makedon, probably in the year between the Theban-Athenian alliance of 339 and the battle of Chaironeia in 338 (Ellis ( 1994 ) 781 ). Ambryssos had a double defence circuit built by the Thebans in 339 / 8 (Paus. 4 . 31 . 5 , 10 . 36 . 3 ). But some sections of the walls found during the excavations are a little later (Fossey ( 1986 ) 30 ; BCH 110 ( 1986 ) 706 , 114 ( 1990 ) 762 ; for the date, see ArchDelt 38 ( 1983 ) 190 -91 ). Pausanias mentions a small agora of unknown date. The principal sanctuary was that of Artemis Diktynnaia, whose statue was of Aiginetan workmanship (Rolley ( 1994 ) 276 -77 )."
172,Amphikaia (Amphikleieus),Phokis,38.4,22.35,310,1494,"172 . Amphikaia (Amphikleieus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 40 , long. 22 . 35 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Α µ φίκαια , ηasper (Hdt. 8 . 33 , most MSS; Steph. Byz. 90 . 3 ) or τά (Hdt. 8 . 33 , Vat. gr. 123 ) or Α µ φίκλεια (Paus. 10 . 33 . 9 , quoting the dioikismos decree of 346 as his source for the changed spelling of the toponym). A local tradition according to which the toponym was ' Οφιτεία is reported by Paus. 10 . 33 . 11 . Apart from Steph. Byz. 90 . 4 , our only attestation of the city-ethnic is Α µ φικλειευacuteς at Paus. 10 . 33 . 11 . Amphikaia is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 8 . 33 and, retrospectively, at Paus. 10 . 3 . 1 and 2 , in both passages in connection with Xerxes' invasion of Phokis in 480 , when Amphikaia was burnt to the ground. Pausanias treats Amphikaia as a polis once again in connection with the dioikismos of the Phokian cities in 346 after the Third Sacred War ( 10 . 3 . 2 -3 and 10 . 33 . 9 : in the decree ( dogma ) about the destruction of the Phokian poleis the Amphiktyonians called it Amphikleia). Both sources show that Amphikaia was a member of the Phokian koinon . The almost quadrangular fortification wall ( c. 250 m (east-west) × c. 200 m (north-south)) is in trapezoidal masonry and has at least three towers on the western and two on the eastern side. A diateichisma encloses a small area in the eastern part of the fortification. The wall cannot be dated more precisely than C4 -C3 (Frazer ( 1898 ) 420 )."
173,Antikyra (Antikyreus),Phokis,38.2,22.35,529,2520,"173 . Antikyra (Antikyreus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 20 , long. 22 . 35 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Αντίκυρα , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 37 ; Polyb. 27 . 16 . 6 ; Demetrios of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 5 ; Paus 10 . 3 . 1 ; BCH 66 -67 ( 1942 -43 ) 69 no. 1 (C2m)) or Αντικυacuteρα , ηasper (Strabo 9 . 3 . 1 ). Paus. 10 . 36 . 5 reports a local tradition according to which the original toponym was Κυπάρισσος . Thus, the Antikyreis could claim mention in the Homeric Catalogue of Ships ( Il . 2 . 519 ; cf. Paus. 10 . 3 . 1 ). This invention of a glorious past (for which see also Paus. 10 . 36 . 6 , 10 and Steph.Byz. 99 . 4 -5 ) may date from the time of the Third Sacred War (Diod. 16 . 23 . 5 -6 ). The city-ethnic is Αντικυρευacuteς ( SGDI 1872 . 8 (C2f); Polyb. 9 . 39 . 2 (rC3l)). Antikyra is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 37 and, retrospectively, by Paus. 10 . 3 . 1 in connection with the dioikismos of 346 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on Heltic coins (Head, HN ² 339 ) and in Heltic proxeny decrees ( IG ix . 1 1 -3 ) and externally in Polyb. 9 . 39 . 2 (rC3l). The individual and external use is attested in Delphic inscriptions of C2 ( SGDI 1872 . 8 ; SEG 18 190 . 5 ). In C3 -C2some federal coins were inscribed ΑΝ , probably an abbreviation of the city-ethnic Αντικυρευacuteς (Head, HN ² 339 ; SNG Cop. Phocis 134 ). A bronze statuette found in a sanctuary of Athena that was probably situated in the territory of Antikyra (Rousset ( 1999 ) 77 n. 55 ) has a dedicatory inscription which, according to the editor, is 'Archaic': ∆ιόνδαι µ' ανέθεκαν τ ' Αθάναι ( BCH 89 ( 1955 ) 257 (C6 -C5 ?)). It is tempting to take the Diondai to be a civic subdivision, in which case the inscription is the oldest testimony we possess about Antikyra's political institutions. A defence circuit is attested for C3l (Livy 26 . 26 . 1 -3 ), but the few uncovered remains do not allow of a more precise date ( ArchDelt 37 ( 1982 ) 205 -6 ; Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 76 ). Pausanias lists an agora,a fountain and two gymnasia , one of which is called 'ancient' , but none can be dated. Excavations have revealed a sanctuary of Athena of the Archaic and Classical periods ( BCH 89 ( 1955 ) 257 (C6f)). Pausanias mentions other sanctuaries: one of Poseidon and, first of all, one of Artemis ( 10 . 37 . 1 ), whose statue, by Praxiteles or his sons, was reproduced on the C2 coins struck by the city ( AM 14 ( 1989 ) 229 -32 ; Lacroix ( 1949 ) 309 -10 ; Head, HN ² 339 )."
174,Boulis (Boulios),Phokis,38.15,22.5,615,3228,"174 . Boulis (Boulios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 15 , long. 22 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: C. The toponym is Βουtildeλις , ηasper , exclusively attested in late literary sources (Paus. 10 . 37 . 2 -3 ; Steph. Byz. 182 . 5 ) or Βουacuteλια , Βουacuteλεια , Βουλεία (Ptol. Geog . 3 . 14 . 18 ). The city-ethnic is Βουacuteλιος (Paus. 10 . 37 . 1 -2 , most MSS) or Βουλίδιος (some MSS and Steph. Byz. 182 . 6 ). According to Pausanias, the toponym was derived from the name Βουacuteλων , the oecist of this colony founded by some of the poleis of Doris: ονο µ άζεται αποgrave Βουacuteλωνος αγαγόντος τήν αποικίαν ανδρός , συνΩsubiotaωκίσθη δεgrave εκ πόλεων τῶν εν αρχαίΩsubiotaα ∆ωρίδι ( 10 . 37 . 2 ). The only sources in which Boulis is classified as a polis are Steph. Byz. and Ptol. Geog ., which lists Boulis among the πόλεις µ εσόγειοι , using polis in a purely topographical sense, as in the case of the Attic demes which are also called πόλεις µ εσόγειοι ( 3 . 15 . 22 ). Even if Pausanias' link between Boulis and Boulon is suspicious, there is no reason to reject his testimony about the foundation of Boulis.And the status of apoikia implies the status of polis . The date of the foundation, however, is unknown. With Herakleia as a possible analogy (Thuc. 3 . 92 ), it is tempting to connect the foundation with the strained relations between Doris and its neighbours in C5 (Thuc. 1 . 107 ). But that remains a hypothesis. It is problematic, on the other hand,that Boulis is not listed by Pausanias as one of the poleis subjected to dioikismos in 346 ( 10 . 3 . 1 -2 ). But this list is not exhaustive (see supra 400 ), and an argument from silence carries no weight. On the contrary, in a mutilated passage Pausanias connects the Boulioi with Philomelos, the Phokians and their assembly: λέγονται δεgrave οιasper Βουacuteλιοι Φιλο µ ήλου καιgrave Φωκέων . . . συacuteλλογον τοgraveν κοινόν (Paus. 10 . 37 . 2 ). No matter how the passage is emended, there must be some connection between the Boulioi and the Phokian assembly in the period 356 -354 . The inference seems to be that Boulis was a polis in the years 356 -354 . It is unknown whether the relations between the Boulioi and the Phokians were friendly or hostile. That depends on how the passage is emended. The text has been interpreted in different ways (see the apparatus in the editions by Hitzig-Bluemner ( 1896 -1910 ) and Rocha Pereira ( 1973 -81 )). The attempt to restore a form of the cityethnic in IG ix . 1 111 . 5 = CID ii 38 is too far-fetched to be further discussed here; cf. infra no. 192 . The remains of Boulis' city walls are undated. The circuit is partly constructed in local limestone in trapezoidal masonry and a part of reddish poros stone in ashlar masonry (Leake ( 1835 ) ii. 520 -23 ; Dassios ( 1992 ) 65 no. 70 ; ArchDelt 36 ( 1981 ) 193 -94 pl. 122 d). The discovery of sherds of the Classical period ensures that the site was inhabited at that time ( ArchDelt 36 ( 1981 ) 193 ). Pausanias mentions three sanctuaries: one of Megistos (undoubtedly Zeus), one of Artemis and one of Dionysos.The cult statues of the two last gods were of wood, but that does not warrant any conclusion about their date (Donohue ( 1988 ) 173 -74 )."

The toponym is Χαράδρα , ηasper (Hdt. 8 . 33 ; BCH 57 ( 1933 ) 68 (C3e)). The cityethnic is Χαραδραῖος ( SGDI 1789 . 11 (C2f); Paus. 10 . 33 . 6 ). The form [ Χαρα ] δραῖοι [ Φωκ ] εῖς is attested in a C4f Delphic inscription ( CID ii 8 . i . 5 ). A C3e proxeny decree has Φωκευgraveς εκ Χαράδρας ( BCH 57 ( 1933 ) 68 . 2 -3 ). Charadra is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 8 . 33 and, retrospectively, at Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 , in both passages in connection with Xerxes' invasion of Phokis in 480 , when Charadra was burnt to the ground. In the accounts of the Delphic naopoioi the [Chara]draioi are recorded as contributors ( CID ii 8 . i . 5 : [ Χαρα ] δραῖοι [ Φωκ ] εῖς ) in a fragmentary list whose lost heading undoubtedly had ταίδε ταtilde µ πολίων ήνικαν vel sim . (cf. CID ii 4 . 1 . 3 -4 ), and here polis is used in the political sense. Pausanias treats Charadra as a polis once again in connection with the dioikismos of the Phokian cities in 346 after the Third Sacred War ( 10 . 3 . 2 -3 ). Pausanias' information is confirmed by the Delphic accounts where the Charadraioi are recorded among the Phokian communities that paid the annual fine ( CID ii 108 . 2 ( 322 )). The collective and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in Delphic inscriptions ( CID ii 8 . i . 4 , ii 108 . 2 ). The individual and external use is found in the C3 Delphic proxeny decree ( BCH 57 ( 1933 ) 68 . 2 -3 ). The dioikismos suffered in 346 and the fine paid in 322 show that Charadra belonged to the Phokian koinon . The identification of Charadra with Mariolata was established definitively by Tillard ( 1911 ) 62 -64 . The site is protected by an undated defence circuit in trapezoidal and pseudo-isodomic masonry, in some cases joggled. A diate- ichisma separated the acropolis to the south from the lower town to the north (Frazer ( 1898 ) 416 ). The southern part of the wall was enforced with at least five towers. The northern part is too poorly preserved to estimate the area enclosed by the city wall."
176,Daulis (Daulieus),Phokis,38.3,22.45,657,3093,"176 . Daulis (Daulieus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 30 , long. 22 . 45 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym recorded in inscriptions and in authors of the Classical period is ∆αυλία , ηasper ( SGDI 2118 . 3 (C2e); Thuc. 2 . 29 . 3 ; Hell . Oxy . 21 . 5 , Chambers), in later literary sources ∆αυacuteλεια (Steph. Byz. 221 . 10 ; Eust. Il . 2 . 520 ). Nevertheless, the lexicographers treat this form as recent (Steph. Byz. 221 . 10 ; Etym. Magn . 250 . 7 ), compared with ∆αυλίς , -ίδος , ηasper attested in the Catalogue of Ships (Hom. Il . 2 . 520 ). The Homeric form is probably the reason why Daulis is the only form attested in Strabo ( 7 . 7 . 1 , 9 . 3 . 1 , 13 ) and Pausanias ( 10 . 3 . 1 , 35 . 8 ). The form ∆αυacuteλιον , τό is found once in Polyb. 4 . 25 . 2 (rC3s). The restoration of the proxeny decree for ∆ίων [ Β ] ουacute [ λων ] ος εγ ∆αυλίο [ υ ] ( ArchEph ( 1907 ) 102 (C1 )) is questionable, and a preferable restoration is ' Επ &lt; ι &gt; δαυρίου . The city-ethnic is ∆αυλιευacuteς attested both in inscriptions ( SGDI 1969 . 5 (C2e)) and in literary sources (Aesch. Cho . 674 ; Theopomp. fr. 385 ; Paus. 10 . 4 . 9 ), whereas ∆αυacuteλιος is found exclusively in literary sources (Hdt. 8 . 35 . 1 ; Hell . Oxy . 21 . 5 ). Daulis is called polis in the urban sense by Hdt. 8 . 35 . 1 in connection with Xerxes' invasion of Greece in 480 , when Daulis was burnt to the ground, and by Hell . Oxy . 21 . 5 in connection with a Theban attack on some Phokian cities in 395 . In both passages the political sense is a connotation (Hansen ( 2000 ) 176 ). The collective use of the ethnic is attested internally in a decree of C2s passed by the polis of the Daulieis ( BCH 59 ( 1935 ) 206 -7 ) and externally in texts of the Classical period (Hdt. 8 . 35 . 1 and Hell . Oxy . 21 . 5 ). The individual and external use is attested in a C4s Delphic account in which a Daulian grammateus witnesses the payment of the fine imposed on the Phokians poleis ( CID ii 112 . 11 : [ ∆αυ ] λιευacuteς γρα µ [---]). Daulis is recorded by Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 among the cities exposed to dioikismos in 346 , which shows that it belonged to the Phokian koinon , an inference further confirmed by the Daulian citizen who witnessed the payment of the fine ( supra ). The territory is indirectly termed χώρα at Hell. Oxy . 21 . 5 . In 395 the Boiotians failed to conquer Daulis ( Hell . Oxy . 21 . 5 ). The abortive attack suggests that Daulis was fortified; but the location of Daulis on the top of a steep hill may in itself have provided sufficient protection. The undated remains of the ancient defence circuit enclose an area of c. 200 × 250 m (Frazer ( 1898 ) 222 ; Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 54 ). Some sections are in polygonal masonry, some in trapezoidal, which is interpreted by Scranton ( 1941 ) 162 and 172 as evidence of successive phases of construction. The principal gate in the western side of the wall is cautiously dated by Winter ( 1971 ) 216 as 'late Classical or Heltic' .A terminus ante quem is, in any case, 198 , when Daulis was conquered by the Romans (Livy 32 . 18 . 7 )."
177,Delphoi (Delphos),Phokis,38.3,32.3,4840,24491,"177 . Delphoi (Delphos) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 30 , long. 32 . 30 . Size of territory: probably 2 or 3 . Type: A. The toponym is normally ∆ελφοί , οιasper (Hdt. 1 . 50 . 1 ; Pl. Ap . 20 E; F.Delphes iii . 1 68 . 1 ( c. 400 )); the epichoric form is sometimes ∆αλφοί (coins ( infra ); F.Delphes III. 1 294 . 13 (C5l/C4e)). The Boiotian form is Βελφοί ( Syll . ³ 201 . 23 (C4m)). The toponym is used with the definite article ( οιasper ∆ελφοί ) only rarely (Diod. 16 . 27 . 3 ). Referring to the sanctuary of Apollo rather than the town of Delphi, poets prefer the toponym Πυθῶν (Hom. Il . 2 . 519 ; Soph. OT 152 ) or Πυθώ ( Hymn. Hom.Ap . 372 ; Ar. Av . 188 -89 ). In prose ∆ελφοί often denotes the whole settlement, of which the sanctuary of Apollo was only a part (Thuc. 1 . 112 . 5 ), but sometimes the sanctuary alone (Thuc. 3 . 57 . 2 ). In Hymn. Hom. Ap . 269 the use of the toponym Krisa to designate Delphi is aetiological (Lerat ( 1948 ), contra Skorda ( 1992 ) 62 -63 ). For the toponym Krisa, see 419 . The city-ethnic is ∆ελφός (Bacchyl. 3 . 21 , Maehler; CID i 8 . 1 ( c. 400 )). Delphi is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 8 . 36 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 37 ) and in the political sense ( CID i 9 A. 2 -3 (C4m)). The earliest epigraphical attestation of a πόλις τῶν ∆ελφῶν is of 363 / 2 ( IG ii² 109 a. 27 ; cf. CID ii 31 . 1 ( 358 / 7 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in ktetic or abbreviated form on coins ( infra ) and in decrees ( CID i 8 ( c. 400 ); SEG 16 307 . 3 (C4f); F.Delphes iii . 1 . 391 . 3 (C4f)) and externally in inscriptions ( IG iv² . 1 122 . 77 (C4 )) and in literary sources (Hdt. 8 . 36 . 2 ; Aeschin. 3 . 122 ). The individual use is attested internally in the naopoioi accounts ( CID ii 10 . i . 10 ( 357 / 6 )) and externally in sepulchral inscriptions ( IG ii² 8478 : ∆ελφίς (C4s)) and in literary sources (Hdt. 5 . 72 . 4 ). It is difficult to determine the exact relation between the sanctuary of Apollo Pythios and the polis of Delphi.As far as territory is concerned, as demonstrated by Rousset ( 2002 ) passim , cf. 286 -88 , one must distinguish between (a) the territory of the polis , called ∆ελφιgraveς ( F.Delphes iii . 4 175 (C3l)), in which houses and landed property were owned by the citizens ( CID ii 67 . 11 -13 (C4f)) and controlled by them through grants of enktesis ( F.Delphes iii . 4 378 . 7 : έ µ πασις (C4s)); (b) land which was part of ∆ελφίς , but consecrated to Apollo (?) (cf. Rousset ( 2002 ) 292 ); it was let out to individuals ( CID ii 67 . 1 ) or communities ( CID ii 67 . 5 ) and was a source of income administered by the Amphiktyony (Sanchez ( 2001 ) 142 -44 ); (c) the hiera chora , the former territory of Krisa/Kirrha(?), consecrated to Apollo after the First Sacred War; it was administered by the Amphiktyony and strictly separated from the territory of Delphi in the Classical and Heltic periods, see infra 419 -20 . The extent of the territory of Delphi in the Classical period is not known, but the presumption is that it was roughly the same as in the Heltic period (cf. Rousset ( 2002 ) 71 -175 ). T o the west Delphi bordered on Amphissa (no. 158 ) ( F.Delphes iii . 3 383 (C2e); Plut. Mor . 249 E-F (rC4m)); to the east it bordered on the Phlygonioi (no. 191 ), incorporated into Delphi in C2e, whereafter the borderland was the territory owned in common (?) by Ambryssians (no. 171 ) and Phlygonians ( F.Delphes iii . 2 136 (C2m)). According to Strabo 9 . 3 . 15 (rC5m), the site called Anemoreia (unlocated) was made the frontier between Delphi and the Phokians when the Lakedaimonians cut Delphi out of the Phokian koinon . T o the south and south-west the territory bordered on the 'Sacred Land' (cf. Krisa/Kirrha). To the north, it is unknown how far the territory stretched up Parnassos; it may have reached the Korykian Grotto (Rousset ( 2002 ) 160 -62 ). We have no information about the total number of citizens (Rousset ( 2002 ) 290 ), but the minimum number of adult male citizens can be established from some decrees passed by the Delphian assembly. When the people voted with pebbles,the decree passed sometimes records the number of votes cast, and three such decrees are preserved: the first records a total of 454 votes ( F.Delphes iii . 1 294 . i . 2 -3 (C4f); cf. Rougemont ( 1998 ) 164 ), the second over 400 votes ( CID i 13 . 35 -37 (C4f)), and the third 353 votes (Lerat ( 1943 ) 63 ). A decision made in C4m by the Labyades, one of the civic subdivisions ( infra 414 ), was passed with 182 votes ( CID i 9 .A. 21 -22 ). Being the seat of one of the two sanctuaries of the Pylo-Delphic Amphiktyony, Delphi, as the only polis , had two seats in the Amphiktyonic Council ( CID ii 36 . i . 24 -25 ( 343 / 2 ); cf. Lefèvre ( 1998 ) 34 -51 ). Delphi's participation in the Council is securely attested in 343 / 2 ( CID ii 36 . i . 24 ; cf. Lefèvre ( 1998 ) 34 -51 ), but probably antedates this occurrence (Theopomp. fr. 63 ; cf. Sanchez ( 2001 ) 119 ). The original date of Delphi's admission to the Amphiktyony, however, cannot be positively established (Sanchez ( 2001 ) 118 -20 ). It has sometimes been dated to the Archaic period and seen as a consequence of the First Sacred War in C6e (e.g. Roux ( 1979 ) 16 -19 ). Alternatively, it has been dated to the Classical period and seen as a consequence of the Lakedaimonian invasion of Phokis in C5m (e.g. Kahrstedt ( 1953 ) 750 ). The original position of the sanctuary of Apollo, serving both the polis and the Amphiktyony, promoted collaboration as well as competition between the two organisations in religious (Lefèvre ( 1998 ) 239 ), military (ibid. 43 ) and financial (ibid. 257 -64 ) matters. Nevertheless, the disputed view that the independence of the polis was sometimes interfered with by the Amphiktyony may merely reflect our ignorance of the organisation and working of the institutions; cf. for example the opposed interpretations of the Amphiktyonic involvement in the exile of Astykrates (Lefèvre ( 1998 ) 49 , contra Sanchez ( 2001 ) 142 -44 , 171 ). Geographically, Delphi was situated in Phokis (Hdt. 8 . 35 . 1 ; Eur. Or . 1094 ; Ps.-Skylax 37 ), but the Delphians refused to be called Phokians (Paus. 4 . 34 . 11 ). Supported by interested allies, the Delphians often clashed with the Phokians who tried to control the sanctuary of Pythian Apollo. There is no mention of Delphi in the sources for the First Sacred War against Kirrha/Krisa (see 419 -20 and no. 183 ). A number of sometimes conflicting sources concern what modern scholars call the Second Sacred War (cf. Thuc. 1 . 112 . 4 ), in which the Lakedaimonians opposed Phokian attempts to control the resources of Apollo's sanctuary in Delphi (schol. Eur. Tro . 9 ; Diod. 16 . 33 . 1 ; Paus. 10 . 15 . 1 ). The issue is difficult; thus it remains problematic that there is no mention of the Amphiktyony (Sanchez ( 2001 ) 106 -9 ), and modern scholars agree in preferring Thucydides'account of a single Lakedaimonian intervention in 449 ( 1 . 112 . 4 ) to other sources' accounts of two interventions, one in 457 (Plut. Cim . 17 . 4 ) and one in 449 , as well as a Boiotian intervention (Philoch. fr. 34 a). Thucydides reports that the Lakedaimonians took possession of the sanctuary and gave it to the Delphians. Strabo ( 9 . 3 . 15 ) adds that the Lakedaimonians separated Delphi from the Phokian koinon . When the Lakedaimonians had left Phokis (Thuc. 1 . 112 . 5 )-or three years later (Philoch. fr. 34 b)-the Athenians sent an army,took possession of Delphi,and gave it to the Phokians (Thuc. 1 . 112 . 5 ). (Sanchez ( 2001 ) 116 prefers to connect the Strabo passage with the Peace of Nikias in 421 , and Meiggs ( 1972 ) 423 is convinced that the Athenian campaign took place immediately after the Lakedaimonians' retreat.) The status of the polis of Delphi was guaranteed in the Peace of Nikias in 421 : 'The sanctuary and the temple at Delphi, and the Delphian people shall be their own masters in legislation, in taxation and in administration of justice, both concerning their persons and their territory, according to their ancestral customs' (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 2 ; cf. Hornblower ( 1996 ) 472 ). This clause probably means that Delphi was free of the Phokian koinon after 421 , and this state of affairs seems to have persisted in 356 when, at the beginning of the Third Sacred War,the Phokians justified their occupation of the sanctuary with a reference to their ancestral right to the oracle. Such a legitimation would have been superfluous if Delphi had been a member of the Phokian koinon . It was in all cases the Delphians who made decisions about access to the oracle, granted to the Phaselitans (no. 942 ) ( CID i 8 ( c. 400 ) = Staatsverträge 218 ) and the Asklepiadai ( CID i 11 (C4s?)), and the Skiathians (no. 520 ) ( CID i 11 (C4s?) = Staatsverträge 295 ). There is no evidence that, during the Sacred War,the Delphians were forced to join the koinon . On the contrary, independence of the koinon is indicated by the fact that the Delphians kept their seats in the Amphictyony while the Phokians were excluded in 346 . Internal strife in, probably, C4f is indicated by the mention of penalties for 'organisation of stasis ' ([ τ ] αtildeς στασιαρ [ χίας ] in the so-called Law of Kadys ( BCH 50 ( 1926 ) 18 . vii . 14 ). In, presumably, C4e (but cf. Rougemont ( 1998 ) 161 -62 ), the first of a number of staseis was caused by the dispute between two Delphic families (Arist. Pol . 1303 b 37 -4 a 3 ; Heracl. Lemb. 52 ; Plut. Mor . 825 B-C; Carrère ( 1984 )). In 363 , Astykrates and his associates, all Delphian citizens, were exiled by the Amphiktyonic Council and fled to Athens, where they obtained Athenian citizenship ( IG ii² 109 ). Their property was confiscated and leased as property belonging to Apollo ( CID ii 67 -72 (C4s)). Perhaps their enemies were, in turn, sent into exile a little later ( CID ii 73 (C4m)). This episode is often seen as reflecting international interference in the government of Delphi in C4f (Pomtow ( 1906 ); cf. Syll . ³ 175 -78 ; Buckler ( 1985 ); contra Sanchez ( 2001 ) 170 ). The penalty of exile, however, is attested already in C5e, when the Delphian Kobon was exiled for having subverted the Pythia (Hdt. 6 . 66 ). The Aristotelian collection of politeiai included a constitution of the Delphians (fr. 494 ; see Musielak ( 1993 )). In C2 Delphi was a democracy (Gauthier ( 1992 )). The constitution of the Classical period has often been interpreted as an oligarchy (Roux ( 1979 ) 61 -93 ; Salviat ( 1984 ); contra Gauthier ( 1990 ); Musielak ( 1993 )), but, pace Roux ( 1979 ) 62 -65 , there is no basis for the view that the citizens were divided into two classes with different political rights. There was a popular assembly (Lerat ( 1943 ) 70 -79 ), to which apparently all citizens were admitted ( contra Roux ( 1979 ) 70 ); it was called αγορά ( F.Delphes iii . 1 294 . i . 1 (C4f)), which is the ancient term (Lerat ( 1943 ) 74 ), and later εκκλησία ( CID ii 32 . 58 -60 (C4s)). An ordinary meeting of this assembly was called τέλειος . The formula συgrave µ ψάφοις ταtildeις εννό µ οις is not attested before C3 , but similar phrases show that a quorum was also required in C4 : πλεθο [ υacute ] σης αγοραtildeς ( Syll . ³ 257 . 14 ( 340 / 39 )), or συgrave µ ψάφωι ταtildeι νικεουacuteσαι ( Syll . ³ 265 . 3 ( 336 / 5 ); cf. Lerat ( 1943 ); Gauthier ( 1990 ) 86 -89 ). Furthermore, three documents record the number of votes cast in favour of the motion (Gauthier ( 1990 ) 87 ): 454 votes ( F.Delphes iii . 1 294 . i . 2 -3 (C4f)), 400 + ( CID i 13 . 35 -37 (C4f)), and 353 (Lerat ( 1943 ) 63 ); for another fragmentary attestation, see Salviat and Vatin ( 1971 ) 52 . The quorum is not known,but the strange formulation of CID i 13 suggests that it could have been 400 votes (Roux ( 1979 ) 69 ). The decisions passed by the assembly were tethmoi ( F.Delphes iii . 1 294 . i . 1 : οasperacuteδ ' οasper τεθ µ ός ) or nomoi (Lerat ( 1943 ) 62 : τοgraveν νό µ [ ον α ] νγράψαι ), or treaties ( CID ¾ 13 (C4f)) or honorific decrees ( Syll . ³ 265 ( 336 / 5 )). The boula had thirty members, divided into two sections of fifteen members, each serving six months ( CID II 32 . 78 -86 ; cf. Roux ( 1979 ) 71 -77 ); the view that it may have been further subdivided into subsections is unconvincing (Tréheux ( 1980 ) 523 -24 ). There is no evidence of probouleusis before C2 (Gauthier ( 1992 ) 123 -26 ). In C4 the powers of the Council were primarily judicial and financial (Roux ( 1979 ) 76 -77 ; Salviat ( 1984 )). It did not, however, possess full powers in either judicial matters (Gauthier ( 1992 ) 130 ) or in financial administration, where, at least on one occasion, the boula was assisted by a board of thirteen προαιρετοιgrave υasperποgrave ταtildeς πόλιος ( CID ii 32 . 26 -29 (C4s); cf. Bousquet ( 1988 ) 184 ; Roux ( 1979 ) 71 , 76 -77 ). There is no information about the composition of the Delphian lawcourts in C5 -C4 , but the existence of lawcourts in C4m is ensured by the grant of προδικία ποτιgrave ∆ελφουacuteς ( F.Delphes iii . 1 392 . 7 -8 ). A C4law on maltreatment of parents mentions a public prison (Lerat ( 1943 ) 63 : δα µ οσίαν οικίαν ). The archon who was the eponymous official is indisputably attested in C4f ( F.Delphes iii . 1 391 ), possibly in C6 (Roux ( 1969 ) 47 ; contra Rougemont ( 1998 ) 161 -62 ), and perhaps even in C6e (Pind. Hyp. Pyth . b). He must be distinguished from the board of eight prytaneis , a financial magistracy in charge of the sacred treasures of Apollo (Bousquet ( 1988 ) 143 m; contra Roux ( 1979 ) 81 -92 ). Of the civic subdivisions, phylai are not attested earlier than C2 ( F.Delphes iii . 3 238 . 10 -11 ), and their number is unknown (for a hypothesis, see Roux ( 1979 ) 88 ). An enfranchisement act of C1 ( F.Delphes iii . 6 79 ) mentions money lent by the tribe δάνειον φυλοτικόν . The entry Λαφριάδαι in Hsch. Λ 436 is the only explicit attestation of phratriai . The Labyades are often called a phratria (cf. CID i p. 43 n. 68 ); however, we have no explicit evidence (Sebillote ( 1997 )), but the mention of Poseidon Phratrios in CID i 9 .B. 13 -14 supports the view. The Labyades are first attested in, presumably, C6l ( CID i 1 . 9 bis ; Roux ( 1969 ) 47 -56 ). In C4m they had an assembly ( alia A. 41 ), some of its decisions required a quorum of 101 votes (B. 9 -10 ), and one of the enactments was passed with 182 votes (A. 21 -23 ). The group had laws (A. 3 ) and magistrates ( tagoi : A. 23 , damiorgoi : D. 19 -20 ); they performed public functions which in Attika were performed by the phratriai ( CID i pp. 26 -88 ). The group was subdivided into patriai . In the Law of Kadys on interest on loans ( BCH 50 ( 1926 ) 15 . 9 -10 ) a patria is mentioned alongside other groups called ηasperρωισσταί and Θίασος , which may or may not have been civic subdivisions. We are totally ignorant of the nature of the Thrakidai mentioned at Diod. 16 . 24 . 3 in connection with the Phokians'occupation of the sanctuary in 356 . In C4s the Delphians conferred proxenia and other honours on citizens from e.g. Selinous (no. 44 ), Pellene (no. 240 ), Arethousa (no. 546 ) and Phleious (no. 355 ) ( F.Delphes iii . 1 391 , 395 , 396 ; SEG 16 309 ). A citizen of Delphi was granted proxenia by the Athenians (no. 361 ) in C4e ( IG ii² 51 ). In C6l Timesitheos of Delphi was victorious in the Olympic and in the Pythian Games ( Olympionikai 140 , 146 ; Hdt. 5 . 72 . 4 ; Paus. 6 . 8 . 6 ). Apollo Pythios was the protective divinity of the Delphians ( CID i 10 . 8 , 35 (C4e)). The Delphians controlled the oracle; they had the exclusive right to grant promanteia , and themselves possessed the first claim to consult the oracle ( F.Delphes iii . 4 375 (C4m); Pouilloux ( 1952 )). Strangers needed the assistance of Delphian proxenoi in order to consult the oracle ( CID i 5 . 4 (C5 ?); Syll . ³ 548 (C3s); cf. Gauthier ( 1972 ) 46 -52 ; Pouilloux ( 1974 )). Treaties about consultation of the oracle were concluded between Delphi and Phaselis (no. 942 ) ( CID i 8 ; Staatsverträge 218 ( c. 400 )) and Delphi and Skiathos (no. 520 ) ( CID i 13 = Staatsverträge 295 (C4f)). Some of the revenues of the Delphians, such as the pelanos , were directly connected with the oracle (Amandry ( 1950 ) 86 -103 ; cf. CID i 11 : ατέλειαν τῶν οasperσίων ). The temple of Apollo was, if not the property, then at least the possession of the Amphiktyones. In C6l (La Coste-Messelière ( 1946 )), when the Amphiktyones had undertaken for the sum of 300 talents to reconstruct the temple, the Delphians had to pay a quarter of the costs and send out envoys to the various poleis to ask for contributions (Hdt. 2 . 180 ). Remains of this temple are preserved, whereas the attribution to the previous temple of some architectural remains of C7 is still a moot point (Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 181 -84 ). The Amphiktyony organised the Pythian Games, but the theoroi who performed the epangelia were sent out by the Delphians ( CID i 10 . 45 -46 ( 380 ) with pp. 118 -19 ; SEG 24 379 (C4m); cf. SourvinouInwood ( 1990 ) 299 ). These theoroi were hosted by theorodokoi appointed by the Delphian polis (Daux ( 1949 ) 4 -11 = Syll . ³ 90 (C5s?); F.Delphes iii . 4 4 (C4s)). Conversely, a Delphian theorodokos was appointed to host theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ) in 356 ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 3 ). The other major sanctuary of the Delphian polis was that of Athena (Hdt. 8 . 39 ), whose temple of the Archaic period has been dated to C7 -C6 (Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 56 -59 ). Cults of other gods are known,but their existence in the Archaic and Classical periods is often unattested (Pomtow ( 1912 ); Roux ( 1976 ) 165 -208 ). For the religious festivals, see CID i 58 -60 . Apart from remains of the Mycenaean period (S. Müller ( 1992 ) 455 -90 ), evidence of a settlement within the sanctuary can be traced back to C10 , and remains of a house have been dated to C8m (Luce ( 1993 )). The earliest dedications to Apollo(?) date from C9l (Rolley ( 1977 ) 135 ), and the first traces of the administration of the sanctuary can be dated to C7e (La Coste-Messelière ( 1969 ) 731 -40 ). The first peribolos of c. 575 may be connected with the formation of the Amphiktyony in Delphi (Luce ( 1992 ) 704 ). In its original form the fountain of Kastalia may date from C7l-C6m (Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 81 -83 ). The Pythian hippodrome and stadion were probably placed in the Kirrhaian plain in the Classical period (Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 215 ; cf. infra 419 ). The Panhellenic sanctuary at Delphi has been excavated and studied in detail by, principally, the French school. The sanctuary ( 2 . 3 ha) is densely built and centres on the socalled Sacred Way which winds its way down the slopes of the temenos . The most conspicuous features are: ( 1 ) the C4 Doric peripteral ( 6 × 15 ) temple of Apollo,which dominates the sanctuary; built after the earthquake of 373 , it replaced a monumental C6 temple adorned with pedimental sculptures, which itself replaced one or more earlier buildings. Later tradition locates the oracle of Apollo in an underground chamber of the temple, no trace of which, however, has been found (Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 176 -84 ); ( 2 ) a C4 -Heltic theatre ( TGR ii. 188 -90 ; Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 207 -12 ); ( 3 ) the treasuries: twenty buildings among the numerous constructions in the sanctuary have been identified, with varying degrees of certainty, as treasuries dedicated by individual Greek poleis or even non-Greek polities (cf. Strabo 5 . 1 . 3 (Etruscan Agylla)); apparently, most treasuries were constructed prior to the Heltic period, but the attribution of individual buildings to specific poleis depends largely on Pausanias. The poleis known to have constructed treasuries are (numerals prefaced with # refer to pl. V in Bommelaer ( 1991 )): Syracuse (no. 47 ), cf. Jacquemin ( 1999 ) no. 453 (after 413 ); Kroton (no. 56 ), cf. Jacquemin ( 1999 ) no. 127 (C6l); Sybaris (no. 70 ), cf. Jacquemin ( 1999 ) no. 445 (C6 ); Spina (no. 85 ), cf.

Hdt. 1 . 51 . 2 and Jacquemin ( 1999 ) no. 112 (C6l); # 219 Knidos (no. 903 ), cf. Jacquemin ( 1999 ) no. 118 (C6m;for the C6m dedicatory inscription F.Delphes iii . 1 289 , see Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 142 ); # 302 Kyrene (no. 1028 ), cf. F.Delphes II and BCH 112 ( 1988 ) 291 -305 , and Jacquemin ( 1999 ) no. 132 ( 334 -324 ). The treasuries of the Athenians, the Sikyonians and the Siphnians were decorated with pedimental sculptures and reliefs in exquisite late Archaic style (Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 118 -26 , 133 -36 ). And ( 4 ) commemorative dedications, outstanding among which are e.g. the Monument of the Admirals,dedicated to commemorate the Spartan victory at Aigos potamoi (cf. ML 95 ( 405 )), and the Athenian thank offering for the victory at Marathon, honouring the commander Miltiades (Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 108 -11 ), and,of course,the Greek thank offering for victories in the Persian War (ML 27 ). For treasuries and other monumental dedications, see the synthetic study by Jacquemin ( 1999 ). Below the sanctuary of Apollo is the sanctuary of Athena ( 0 . 5 ha). The central features of this sanctuary are, from west to east: ( 1 ) the C6l temple of Athena Pronaia, which replaced an earlier construction; it is Doric peripteral ( 6 × 12 ); ( 2 ) a C5e Doric treasury,of unknown ownership;( 3 ) the C6s Aiolic Treasury generally ascribed to Massalia (no. 3 ), which also housed dedications by Rome (cf. Diod. 14 . 93 . 4 (r 393 )); ( 4 ) a C4e tholos ; and ( 5 ) a C4f Doric prostyle hexastyle temple, of Athena or possibly Artemis (Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 46 -71 ). The town of the Archaic and Classical periods is poorly attested, and occasional references in the inscriptions are obscure (on the toponym of Thuia,see Jacquemin ( 1992 )). It is not known where the assembly met ( contra Roux ( 1979 ) 70 ); a public prison ( δα µ οσία οικία ) is mentioned in a C4 text (Lerat ( 1943 ) 63 ); texts of C2mention a bouleion ( F.Delphes iii . 2 89 ) which has not been securely located (Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 144 ); and the location of the prytaneion is likewise unknown ( CID ii 81 .A. 16 (C4s)). A dikasterion -either a lawcourt or a court room-is mentioned in a C4f document ( F.Delphes iii . 1 295 , inv. 1373 ). The gymnasion in Delphi is of C4s (Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 72 -79 ). It is commonly believed that the town of Delphi was unfortified. The walls situated on the rocky ridge west of the sanctuary have,tentatively,been attributed to Philomelos (Diod. 16 . 25 . 1 ; Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 217 ). The Logari tower east of the sanctuary may date from the same period (Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 41 ). South of the sanctuary are some undated remains of walls (P. Leriche, pers. comm.). Delphi struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard from C6l to C4m ( 356 / 5 ). ( 1 ) Several series of small denominations struck from C6l to C5m, and from C5l to C4m. Trihemiobol: obv . ram's head, beneath: dolphin; rev . goat's head facing between two dolphins; legend: at first anepigraphic, then ∆ΑΛ on coins of C5m, ∆ΕΛ on coins of C4 . Tritartemorion: obv . head of (Ethiopian) negro; rev . goat's head facing between ∆Α reversed, or three Τ s in triangular pattern. Tetartemorion: obv . bull's head; rev . goat's head facing between ∆Α reversed. ( 2 ) Tridrachms and didrachms struck in C5f. Tridrachm: obv . two rams' heads in juxtaposition, faces downwards, above two dolphins; legend: ∆ΑΛΦΙΚΟΝ ; rev . four incuse squares, in each of which a dolphin and a flower. Didrachm: obv . ram's head, beneath dolphin; legend: ∆ΑΛΦΙΚΟΝ ; rev . four incuse squares, in each of which a star (Kraay ( 1976 ) 121 -22 ; Picard ( 1991 ) 33 -36 ; SNG Cop.Aetolia-Euboea 139 -48 )."
178,Drymos (Drymios),Phokis,38.45,22.35,449,2179,"178 . Drymos (Drymios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 45 , long. 22 . 35 . Size of territory: probably 2 . Type: A. The toponym is ∆ρυ µ ός (Hdt. 8 . 33 ) or ∆ρυacute µ ος , οasper (Eust. Il . 2 . 298 . 7 , van der Valk) or ∆ρυ µ αία , ηasper (Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 ; 33 . 12 ) or ∆ρυ µ ία (Steph. Byz. 239 . 18 ). The city-ethnic is ∆ρυacute µ ιος ( IG ix . 1 226 . 2 (C2f); F.Delphes iii . 4 277 . 25 (C2s); SGDI 1712 . 1 (C2m)).Apart from ∆ρυ µ ιευacuteς at Steph.Byz. 239 . 19 -20 , the only attestation in literary sources of a city-ethnic is ∆ρυ µ αῖος in Paus. 10 . 33 . 12 . According to Paus. 10 . 32 . 12 , the original toponym (or cityethnic?) was Ναυβολεῖς . Drymos is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 8 . 33 and, retrospectively, at Paus. 10 . 3 . 1 and 2 , in both passages in connection with Xerxes' invasion of Phokis in 480 , when Drymos was burnt to the ground.Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 treats Drymos as a polis in the urban sense in connection with the dioikismos of the Phokian cities in 346 after the Third Sacred War. The dioikismos suffered in 346 shows that Drymos belonged to the Phokian koinon . The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested in a C2f agreement between Drymos and the Oitaian Federation ( IG ix . 1 226 . 2 : ηasper πόλις τῶν ∆ρυ µ ίων ). The individual and external use is attested in Delphic inscriptions ( F.Delphes iii . 4 277 . 25 (C2s)). Drymos was protected by a large defence circuit of triangular shape. Today its base toward the south has completely disappeared, but remains of it were seen by Frazer ( 1898 ) 423 -24 . The western and eastern side stretched c. 450 m and 350 m respectively,and were equipped with towers at regular intervals of c. 50 m.At the northern end the circuit was divided by two diateichismata also equipped with towers. The whole fortification was thus subdivided into three sections of unequal size. The upper part enclosed an area of c. 20 ha (Frazer ( 1898 ) 423 -24 ; Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 2 ). It was built in irregular isodomic masonry,and was dated to C4l by Winter ( 1971 ) 36 , 158 . Paus. 10 . 33 . 12 mentions an ancient sanctuary of Demeter Thesmophoros and the celebration of Thesmophoria."
179,Echedameia (Echedamieus).,Phokis,,,195,1049,"179 . Echedameia (Echedamieus). Map 55 . Unlocated. Type: B. The toponym is ' Εχεδά µ εια , ηasper (Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 ) The city-ethnic is ' Εχεδα µ ιευacuteς ( SGDI 1983 . 13 (C2e)). Echedameia is listed by Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 among the poleis (in the urban sense) exposed by Philip to dioikismos in 346 . Pausanias was the only source for Echedameia until the discovery in 1863 (Wescher-Foucart) of a Delphic manumission inscription of 194 ( SGDI 1983 ) in which both the vendors and one of the guarantors are recorded with the city-ethnic ' Εχεδα µ ιευacuteς as the second part of their name. The two vendors are further described as living in Tithronion. Echedamia is still unlocated. Its absence from the list of cities sacked by the Persians in 480 has induced some scholars to assume a location in the southern part of Phokis (Bursian ( 1862 ) 1 . 182 ), but Lilaia is likewise absent from the list, which calls for circumspection. No topographical conclusion can be based on the fact that two Echedamieis were living in Tithronion ( SGDI 1983 )."
180,Elateia (Elateus),Phokis,38.4,22.5,1055,5018,"180 . Elateia (Elateus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 40 , long. 22 . 50 . Size of territory: 3 or 4 . Type: A. The toponym is ' Ελάτεια , ηasper (Hdt. 8 . 33 ; Hell . Oxy . 21 . 5 ; F.Delphes iii . 4 219 . 2 (C4l)) or ' Ελάτη (Hsch. Ε 1887 ) or Γaltελατίη in a Boiotian inscription of C3s ( IG vii 3171 . 26 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ελατευacuteς ( CID ii 38 . 14 -16 (C4s)) or Ελατειευacuteς ( CID ii 38 . 3 -5 (C4s); SEG 1 199 . 3 (C3m)). Elateia is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 8 . 33 , and in Ps.-Skylax 61 Elateia is the third toponym listed after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε , where polis is again used in the urban sense; the political sense is found in IG ix . 1 130 . 2 (C4 ). The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a Heltic proxeny decree ( IG ix . 1 100 . 1 : αasper πόλις τῶν ' Ελατέων (C3l)). The individual and external use is found in a Delphic proxeny decree of C4s ( BCH 73 ( 1949 ) 263 no. 11 . 4 -5 ). The territory is called ' Ελάτεια (Theophr. Hist. pl . 8 . 8 . 2 ) and it covered a large part of the Kephisos valley ( Hell . Oxy . 21 . 5 ; Plut. Sull . 16 . 1 : ταgrave ' Ελατικαgrave πεδία ). Elateia controlled the valley, and its strategic importance is frequently attested (Dem. 18 . 169 ; Diod. 16 . 84 . 2 ; Strabo 9 . 3 . 2 ; see Pritchett ( 1982 ) 123 -75 ). In later sources Elateia is repeatedly, and sometimes retrospectively, singled out as the largest of the Phokian poleis (schol.Dem. 18 no. 262 , Dilts; Harp. Ε 32 ; Strabo 9 . 2 . 19 ; Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 , 34 . 1 ; Steph. Byz. 264 . 3 ). The exact size of the territory is unknown,but the possible disappearance of Pedieis (no. 189 ) after 346 and the unquestionable diappearance of Parapotamioi (no. 188 ) may have made Elateia the largest polis of Phokis. Thus, Elateia came to control the main pass between Phokis and Boiotia, which would explain the Athenian panic in 339 at the news of the fall of the city (Dem. 18 . 169 ). Like the other Phokian poleis , Elateia was sacked and the city burned down by the Persians in 480 (Hdt. 8 . 33 ). In 395 the Boiotians overran the plain around Elateia and Pedieis (no. 189 ), and the population settled in the plain ( Hell. Oxy . 21 . 5 ). In 346 it was one of the cities dioikised by Philip (Paus. 10 . 3 . 1 ). Membership of the Phokian koinon is ensured by the recording in C4s of two Elateians among the archontes of the Phokians ( CID ii 38 . 3 -5 ) and by the Phokian dedication in Delphi in 304 and 301 celebrating the liberation of Elateia ( F.Delphes iii . 4 219 ; Paus. 1 . 26 . 3 , 10 . 18 . 7 , 34 . 2 ; cf. Flacelière ( 1937 ) 47 , 53 -55 , 61 ; Jacquemin ( 1999 ) 347 ). The principal divinity of Elateia was Athena Kranaia (Paus. 10 . 34 . 7 ). Enactments of the Phokian koinon were set up in her sanctuary from at least C4 onwards.The records of the payments of the Phokian fine to Delphi were found there ( IG ix . 1 109 -15 = CID ii 37 -42 ; cf. also IG ix . 1 96 (C3 )). Excavations of the sanctuary have revealed remains of the Archaic and Classical periods (Paris ( 1892 ) 253 -99 ). According to a tradition reported by Paus. 8 . 4 . 4 , 10 . 34 . 2 -3 and attested already in C2 ( SEG 11 1107 (C2e); Paus. 7 . 15 . 5 (rC2m); cf. Habicht ( 1998 ) 67 -69 ), Elateia was founded by the Arkadian Elatos, the son of Arkas. If it is true that the C5 Delphic statue group of Zeus, Kallisto and Elatos was dedicated by the Elateians, this foundation myth can be traced back to the Classical period. However, the attribution of the group to the Elateians is not above suspicion ( F.Delphes iii . 4 142 -44 (C5 reinscribed in C4 ; see Jacquemin ( 1999 ) 53 )). In C5Elateia had a defence circuit,part of which collapsed in the earthquake of 426 (Demetrios of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 6 ).An anecdote of doubtful value reports a siege of Elateia by Pelopidas in 374 and refers to the gates of the wall (Polyaen. 2 . 38 . 1 ; cf. Schober ( 1924 ) 69 , contra Ellinger ( 1993 ) 332 ). The defence circuit,or at least part of it, must have been destroyed as a consequence of the dioikismos in 346 , as is confirmed by Demosthenes, who in 344 told the Athenians that there were rumours that Philip intended to have Elateia fortified (Dem. 6 . 14 ). In 338 , after his capture of Elateia, Philip built a palisade and placed a garrison in the city (Aeschin. 3 . 140 ). In C2e both the acropolis and the lower town were protected by a circuit (Livy 32 . 24 ). Remains of walls in polygonal masonry were reported by ninettenthcentury travellers (Lolling ( 1989 ) 177 ; Paris ( 1892 ) 25 -33 ). All that can be seen today are some parts of a wall in Lesbian masonry and some of one in isodomic masonry (Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 38 ). The wall in isodomic masonry uncovered in the early twentieth century is undoubtedly the circuit enclosing the lower town (Paris ( 1892 ) 39 ). The Archaic-looking drachm with the legend ΕΛΑΤΕΟΝ (retr.) recorded in Head, HN ² 342 is rejected as a forgery by Babelon, Traité ii. 3 . 317 -18 n. 2 ."
181,Erochos (Erochos),Phokis,38.4,22.35,629,3134,"181 . Erochos (Erochos) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 40 , long. 22 . 35 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is /acuteΕρωχος (Hdt. 8 . 33 ) or ' Ερωχός (Hdt. 8 . 33 , Codex D; Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 ). The form ' Ερόχ [ οι ] attested in an undated inscription ( SEG 27 143 ) is probably an Archaic spelling of ' Ερώχωι ; cf. infra . The city-ethnic is ' Ερωχός ( CID ii 38 . 6 ( 337 / 6 )). Erochos is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 8 . 33 and, retrospectively, at Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 , in both passages in connection with Xerxes' invasion of Phokis in 480 , when Erochos was burnt to the ground.Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 treats Erochos as a polis once again in connection with the dioikismos of the Phokian cities in 346 after the Third Sacred War. The external and individual use of the city-ethnic is attested for two magistrates of the Phokian koinon , an archon and a grammateus , and a witness to the payment of the fine ( CID ii 38 . 4 , 6 , 14 -15 ; cf. IG ix . 1 111 ( 337 / 6 )). Erochos was situated at Ano Souvala (not Kato-Souvala as misprinted in Barr .). The location was definitively established by Tillard ( 1911 ) 61 -63 and has been confirmed by the discovery of a dedication to ∆ά µ ατρι εν ' Ερώχωι found in a sanctuary of Demeter situated c. 2 . 5 km north-east of the fortified settlement ( SEG 27 143 ) at Kato-Souvala. In the sanctuary were found votive offerings of the Archaic, Classical and Heltic periods ( ArchDelt 27 ( 1972 ) Chron . 386 ). The inscriptions are published only provisionally and cannot be dated with precision. But since all other attestations of toponym and ethnic have omega , the omicron in ΕΡΟΧ [ ΟΙ ] must stand for an omega . It follows that the terminus ante quem of the dedication is C4e, when omega became used for the long sound and omicron was restricted to the short. The phrase εν ' Ερόχ [ οι ] shows that in C4e the sanctuary was situated in the territory of Erochos and that the toponym /acuteΕρωχος could be used to denote the territory as well as the city. But in the sanctuary were also found stamped tiles inscribed ΛΙΛΑΙΕΩΝ in letters datable to the Heltic period. Thus, at least the sanctuary was now controlled by the Lilaieis (no. 185 ), and, following Robert and Robert ( BE ( 1978 ) 236 ), the presumption is that, when the tiles were made, Erochos had been incorporated into Lilaia. This assumption is probably confirmed by the double eponymous archons attested in Lilaia in C3l ( F.Delphes iii . 4 133 -35 ). T o have two eponymous officials is not attested in any other Phokian polis , and a sympoliteia with Erochos offers a plausible explanation of the anomaly. When the incorporation took place is not known, but a terminus post quem is 337 / 6 , the date of CID ii 38 = IG ix . 1 111 ; see supra . The town of Erochos was situated on the top of the hill of Ag. Vassilios and was protected by a defence circuit, the foundations of which are still visible. The habitation quarters seem to have covered some of the area outside the wall (Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 10 ). The cemetery excavated at KatoSouvala contains remains of C8 onwards ( AAA 15 ( 1982 ) 76 -85 )."
182,Hyampolis (Hyampolios),Phokis,38.35,22.55,950,4724,"182 . Hyampolis (Hyampolios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 35 , long. 22 . 55 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is usually ' Υά µ πολις , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 521 ; Hdt. 8 . 28 ; Paus. 10 . 1 . 3 ; IG ix . 1 86 . 1 ( c. ad 100 )). However, a scholiast on Homer (schol. Hom. Il . 521 ) and Eust. Il . 275 . 5 , both citing the same source, claim that the locals ( εγχώριοι ) call it ' Υσά µ πολις . In inscriptions, the city-ethnic is invariably ' Υα µ πόλιος ( SEG 37 422 (C5s)), whereas literary sources have ' Υα µ πολίτης (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 27 ). The interpretation of the toponym as a composite word whose second part is πόλις -whether correct or not-has led to the construction of variant forms of both toponym and city-ethnic. From the accusative written in two words, /asperacuteΥην πόλιν ( Hell. Oxy . 21 . 5 ) or /asperacuteΥαν πόλιν (Diod. 16 . 56 . 1 ), some authors invented the nominative /asperacuteΥα (Strabo 9 . 2 . 3 , 3 . 15 ), and this form was then connected with the Hyantes of Thebes (Paus. 10 . 35 . 5 ; Strabo 9 . 2 . 3 ), whereas the schol.Eur. Or . 1094 claim that Hyampolis is a foundation of Hyamos, the son of Lykoros. By analogy with polis -polites , the authors construct the city-ethnic ' Υα µ πολίτης , which is the only form found in literary sources (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 27 ; Paus. 10 . 1 . 8 ; Steph. Byz. 644 . 10 ). Hyampolis is called a polis in the urban sense by Hdt. 8 . 33 in connection with Xerxes' invasion of Phokis in 480 , when Hyampolis was burnt to the ground; by Hell. Oxy . 21 . 5 in connection with the Boiotian campaign into Phokis in 395 ; and retrospectively by Paus. 10 . 3 . 1 , where Hyampolis is listed as one of the poleis exposed to dioikismos in 346 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in SEG 37 422 . 5 (C5s), where the ' Υανπόλιοι appear as guarantors of a loan. For the individual and external use, see IG vii 3055 . 39 (C4m),where an [ ' Υα µ ] πόλιος is attested as consulting the oracle of Trophonios at Lebadeia (no. 211 ). The city was situated in the middle of a pass which was one of the main approaches to Phokis from the north (Paus. 10 . 1 . 11 ; Ellinger ( 1993 ) 22 -27 ). In C1 the city bordered on Opous (no. 386 ; Strabo 9 . 2 . 23 ) and, being a border town, Hyampolis became the centre of legendary stories about the conflicts between Phokis and Thessalia in the Archaic period (C6 ?; cf. Ellinger ( 1993 ) 17 -22 ). The sanctuary of Artemis Elaphebolia was situated in the territory of Hyampolis ( SEG 37 422 -23 ), and from C6 (?) the Phokians celebrated the annual Elaphebolia in this sanctuary, commemorating their victory over the Thessalians (Plut. Mor . 244 B-D, 660 D, 1099 E-F;cf.Ellinger ( 1993 ) 22 -37 ). The recent excavations of the sanctuary of Artemis Elaphebolia and Apollo have revealed continuous habitation and utilisation from the Mycenaean age ( LH iii C) to the Byzantine period (Felsch and Kienast ( 1975 ); Felsch et al . ( 1980 ), ( 1987 ); Felsch and Siewert ( 1987 ); Kalapodi i : xvi -xvii ). A C2 inscription lists the landed property belonging to Apollo and Artemis ( IG ix . 1 87 ). In connection with the Archaic wars between the Phokians and the Thessalians, Plut. Mor . 244 D (rC6 ) mentions the toponym Κλεώναι , and some commentators have erroneously assumed the existence of a community dependent on Hyampolis ( supra 407 ). If one can trust Pausanias' piece of information that, in the C6 war against Thessalia, the Phokian cavalry was commanded by a ∆αιφάντης ' Υα µ πολίτης , it follows that Hyampolis was a member of the Phokian koinon , and that is further confirmed by the Phokian federal coinage: the female head on the reverse of some of the triobols struck in C6l by the Phokians is usually taken to be the head of Artemis Elaphebolia (Williams ( 1972 ) 2 ), and a rare issue of C5m has on the obverse a kneeling Artemis armed with bow and quiver (Williams ( 1972 ) 43 ; Felsch and Siewert ( 1987 ) 687 ). In C4e Hyampolis was fortified with a defence circuit, and in 395 the Boiotians made an abortive attack on the walls of the city ( Hell. Oxy . 21 . 5 ). In 371 Jason of Pherai invaded Phokis, conquered the suburb ( τοgrave προάστιον ) of Hyampolis and ravaged the χώρα (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 27 ). Remains of the fortifications are still visible on the plateau where Hyampolis once lay. A circuit wall encloses an area of some 280 m (north-south) by 200 m (east-west).The wall is in trapezoidal masonry, with a dozen interval towers and is usually dated to C4s (Fossey ( 1986 ) 72 -73 ). Paus. 10 . 35 . 6 mentions a small bouleuterion , a theatre near the gate and an ancient agora, and he believes that these buildings antedated the dioikismos of 346 ."

Robertson ( 1978 ); Parker ( 1997 )). From a linguistic point of view the attested forms can easily be explained as phonetic variants of the same toponym; but an identification depends on (a) an identification of the corresponding ethnics Κιρραῖοι and Κρισαῖοι , mentioned in accounts of the First Sacred War;(b) the location of Homeric Krisa and Classical Kirrha. These questions have been debated since Antiquity (Strabo 9 . 3 . 3 -4 ; Paus. 10 . 37 . 5 ; Steph. Byz. 385 . 7 ; for modern controversies over the First Sacred War, see infra 420 ). The city-ethnic is Κιρραῖος (Aeschin. 3 . 107 -8 ; Dem. 18 . 152 ; Kallisthenes ( FGrHist 124 ) fr. 1 ). Kirrha is called a polis in the urban sense at Aeschin. 3 . 108 -9 . All attestations of the cityethnic testify to the collective and external use. Since C4 at least, Kirrha was the name of the port of Delphi ( CID ii 31 (C4f); Polyb. 5 . 27 . 3 ; F.Delphes iii . 1 318 (C1 ); Paus. 10 . 37 . 4 : τοgrave επίνειον ∆ελφῶν ). Kirrha is classified as a χωρίον in Paus. 10 . 37 . 5 , and at 10 . 37 . 6 he quotes an oracle in which it is described as a citadel ( πόληος . . . πυacuteργον ; cf. Diod. 9 . 16 ; Aeschin. 3 . 112 ; Fontenrose ( 1978 ) Q 71 ). With this harbour town was associated a territory called Κιρραία χώρα (Dem. 18 . 149 ) or Κιρραῖον πεδίον (Ps.Skylax 37 ; cf. Rousset ( 2002 ) 183 -87 ). In the Classical period this plain corresponded to the lower Pleistos valley, which stretches from Delphi and Amphissa to the port of Kirrha. Such a location explains the exploitation by the Amphissaians (Aeschin. 3 . 119 ) as well as the occasional reference to the plain as being Lokrian (schol. Hom. Il . 2 . 520 ). In other sources the plain is called Κρισαῖον πεδίον (Hdt. 8 . 32 . 2 ; Isoc. 14 . 31 ). The Pythian hippodrome and stadium were probably placed here in the Classical period (Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 215 ), and accordingly each of these two sports grounds were called Κίρρα by Pindar ( Pyth . 3 . 74 ; 8 . 19 ) and Bacchylides ( 11 . 13 ). The variant Κρίσα (Pind. Pyth . 6 . 18 ; Soph. El . 730 ) has a Homeric touch (Lerat ( 1948 )). The port of Kirrha is ideally situated at modern Xeropighado (Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 128 ). There are some prehistoric remains (Hope Simpson ( 1981 ) 78 ; Skorda ( 1992 ) 42 -43 , 60 -61 ), then a complete break, and then again partly excavated remains of C6s and later: (a) a defence circuit, part of which is described by the excavator as Classical ( ArchDelt 49 ( 1994 ) Chron . 317 -18 ). The circuit was still visible in the midnineteenth century (Ulrichs ( 1863 ) 207 -8 ); (b) remains of Classical habitation ( ArchDelt 34 ( 1979 ) Chron . 207 , 49 ( 1994 ) Chron . 317 ) and habitation of the Roman period; (c) remains of the harbour and warehouses(?) (Rolley et al . ( 1990 ) 28 -29 ); (d) a sanctuary probably dedicated to Apollo, Artemis and Leto with offerings dating back to C6m (Luce ( 1991 )). It is probably(?) in Kirrha that one should place the common παστάδες mentioned in the Amphiktyonic law of 380 ( CID i 10 . 22 ). The site was apparently not destroyed by the intervention of the hieromnemones instigated by Aischines in 340 (Aeschin. 3 . 123 ; Luce ( 1991 )). The port of Kirrha was situated on the territory consecrated to Apollo (Aeschin. 3 . 107 ) and administered by the Amphiktyony, which interfered with the collection of harbour dues (Aeschin. 3 . 119 ; BCH 118 ( 1994 ) 99 -112 (C5 )) and in the accommodation arrangements ( CID i 10 . 2 . 2 ( 380 )). Consequently, the port did not belong to the city of Delphi. The extra-territorial status of Kirrha fits the only secure attestation of the ethnic Κιρραῖοι not related to the First Sacred War. At Dem. 18 . 152 the collective form Κιρραῖοι appears as a kind of pseudo-ethnic denoting the persons who in C4m had fraudulently settled the land consecrated to Apollo,the Κιρραία χώρα ( 18 . 149 ). The suggestion that the Kirrhaioi struck coins is based on an erroneous reading (Williams ( 1972 ) 72 ), and the only epigraphical attestation of the ethnic is questionable ( SGDI 2505 (C4 -C3 ); cf. Rousset ( 2002 ) 33 , 213 ). The Κιρραία χώρα was part of a larger area called γηtilde ιasperερά ( CID i 10 . 21 ; Aeschin. 3 . 118 ). This sacred area comprised,to the south, a large part of the Desphina peninsula (Rousset ( 1996 ), ( 2002 ) 58 -59 ), and to the east it bordered on the Phokian poleis of Antikyra (no. 173 ) and Ambryssos (no. 171 ) ( F.Delphes iii . 4 280 B-D (C2s); Rousset ( 2002 ) 168 -69 ). Agriculture and, in general, any kind of exploitation of the territory consecrated to Apollo was prohibited ( CID i 10 . 15 -17 ; Aeschin. 3 . 108 -9 ); only the herds of Apollo were allowed to graze the plain (Rousset ( 2002 ) 192 -205 ). The prohibition was repeatedly ignored by the Phokians during the Second and Third Sacred Wars (Paus. 10 . 15 . 1 (C5m);cf.Parke ( 1939 ) 65 -71 ; Diod. 16 . 23 . 3 (C4m)).In 340 , in the prelude to the Fourth Sacred War, the Amphissaians were accused by Aischines of having built farms and brickworks in the plain, of having refortified and resettled the harbour town, and of having levied taxes from the visitors (Aeschin. 3 . 113 , 119 ). The only Classical classification of Kirrha as a polis occurs in this context. In a speech delivered in 340 , Aischines reminds the Amphiktyonic Council of the oracle which triggered the First Sacred War in C6e: to fight the Kirrhaioi and Kragalidai (described as γένη ), to ravage their territory ( χώρα ) and their town ( πόλις used in the urban sense), to expose the population to andrapodismos , to consecrate the land to Apollo, Artemis, Leto and Athena Pronoia, and to leave it untilled (Aeschin. 3 . 108 ; Fontenrose ( 1978 ) Q 70 ). According to Aischines, the Council voted for war, and the Kirrhaioi and Kragalidai were exposed to the penalties described in the oracle,including the destruction of the polis (Aeschin. 3 . 109 -11 ). It is unclear what genos denotes, and whether the polis is that of the Kirrhaioi or the Kragalidai, or a city common to both groups; see supra 402 . In addition to Aischines' account of the historical background to the Fourth Sacred War, we have a number of later historiographic accounts of the First Sacred War (Kallisthenes ( FGrHist 124 ) fr. 1 ; Hippoc. Ep . 27 , pp. 406 -8 , Littré; Diod. 9 . 16 ; Strabo 9 . 3 . 3 -4 ; Plut. Sol . 11 ; Polyaen. 3 . 5 , 6 . 13 ; Paus. 10 . 37 . 4 -8 ; Pind. Hyp. Pyth . a and b). But these accounts are notoriously muddled and contradict one another (Robertson ( 1978 ); Lehmann ( 1980 ); Càssola ( 1980 ); Davies ( 1994 )). NoArchaic remains antedating C6m have been found at Xeropighado ( supra 419 ). No site fits the historiographic account of the events (siege and destruction of a fortified settlement), or the location (between Delphi and the Corinthian Gulf), or the chronology (C6e) (cf. Rousset ( 2002 ) 43 -44 ). Another point to be taken into account is the marginal location of the port of Kirrha in relation to the peninsula of Desphina,which constituted the central part of the sacred land. This topography does not fit the historical traditions (cf., however, Pind. Hyp. Pyth . b). The state of the evidence speaks against accepting Kirrha as a polis destroyed in C6e. On the contrary,the sources seem to substantiate the opposite view: that, in the Archaic period down to C6e, there was no polis of the Kirrhaioi whose territory had been consecrated to Apollo. The polis status of Krisa/Kirrha in C6e is an aetiological invention which became prominent in the context of the Third and Fourth Sacred Wars in order to explain the obscure origin of the hiera ge . In that case, there is no reason to debate the historicity of such a polis any longer (see Krisa, supra 419 )."
184,Ledon (Ledontios),Phokis,38.4,22.4,496,2503,"184 . Ledon (Ledontios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 40 , long. 22 . 40 , but see infra . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: B. The only attestations of the toponym Λέδων , -οντος , ηasper are in Paus. 10 . 2 . 2 and 33 . 1 , also our only source for the city-ethnic: Λεδόντιος ( 10 . 33 . 1 ). The C2 bronze coins inscribed ΛΕ must be assigned to Elateia (no. 180 ); cf. supra 417 . Ledon is retrospectively called a polis by Pausanias, both in the political and in the urban sense: he tells us that Ledon, one of the poleis among the Phokians, was the fatherland of the strategos Philomelos ( πατριgraveς δεgrave αυτΩsubiotaῶ Λέδων τῶν εν Φωκευtildeσιν ηtildeν πόλεων ( 10 . 2 . 2 (r 357 ))); and we hear that Ledon was one of the poleis exposed to dioikismos in 346 ( 10 . 3 . 2 ). The urban sense is dominant at 10 . 33 . 1 , where Pausanias reports that Ledon had once been a polis , but that in his time the few surviving Ledontians had abandoned their polis and settled near the Kephisos. Ledon's fate in 346 shows that it was a member of the Phokian koinon (Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 ). The absence of Ledon from Herodotos' account at 8 . 35 has induced some scholars to suppose that Ledon may have been the successor of one of the settlements that disappear in the course of the Classical period, e.g. Pedieis (no. 189 ) (Leake ( 1835 ) ii. 89 ), but such an assumption does not square with the documents found later ( Hell . Oxy .; CID ii 5 ; cf. infra 424 ). The location of Ledon cannot be established with certainty. According to Paus. 10 . 33 . 1 , it lay in the Kephisos valley: a road leads from Tithorea to the ancient site of Ledon, situated some 40 stades from the river Kephisos, where the Ledontians were settled in the time of Pausanias. In light of the uncertain nature of the physical remains, the identification of Ledon with the site of Gournes Aghia Marina (Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 32 ) is questionable. An identification with Modi remains more satisfactory (Tillard ( 1911 ) map; Klaffenbach ( 1937 ); Kirsten ( 1951 ) 716 , 741 ; Barr .), although others have suggested an identification of Modi with Triteis (no. 196 ) (Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 21 ; McInerney ( 1999 ) 281 -83 ). At Modi are the remains of a small fortification ( 100 × 100 m) in isodomic masonry, presumably of the Classical or Heltic period, whereas Tillard ( 1911 ) 54 suggests 338 as the terminus ante quem . The remains fit Ledon better than Triteis, a polis that disappears completely from all sources after 480 (cf. no. 196 )."
185,Lilaia (Lilaieus),Phokis,38.4,22.3,1239,6170,"185 . Lilaia (Lilaieus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 40 , long. 22 . 30 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: B. The toponym is Λίλαια , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 523 ; Theopomp. fr. 385 ; Paus. 10 . 3 . 1 (rC4m); BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 41 (C2f), Oulhen). The form Λίλαιον is late and is only found in literary sources (Ptol. Geog . 3 . 14 . 14 ; Suda Λ 538 ). The city-ethnic is Λιλαιευacuteς ( IG ix . 1 111 (C4s)). Lilaia is not explicitly called a polis in any Archaic or Classical source. Paraphrasing Theopompos (fr. 385 ) and quoting the Homeric Catalogue of Ships ( Il . 2 . 523 ), Strabo classifies Lilaia as a polis in the territorial sense ( 9 . 3 . 16 ). Theopompos is cited for the information that the river Kephisos rose near Lilaia ( εκ Λιλαίας . . . Φωκικηtildeς πόλεως ). We cannot be sure, however, that the term polis stems from Theopompos (cf. Jacoby ad loc .). Lilaia is retrospectively listed as a polis in the urban sense at Paus. 10 . 3 . 1 , describing the dioikismos of the Phokian poleis in 346 , and at 10 . 33 . 3 Pausanias reports that the city was refounded ( ανΩsubiotaωκίσθη αυτοῖς ηasper πόλις ), presumably in C4l ( infra ). The collective and external use of the city-ethnic is found in abbreviated form on some C5f coins ( infra ) and in an inscription of 322 recording the Phokians' payment of the fine imposed in 346 ( CID ii 108 . 6 ). For the individual and external use, see the [ Λι ] λαιεῖς and the [ Λι ] λαιευacuteς who made a contribution to the sanctuary of Apollo in Delphi ( CID ii 2 . i . 6 , 9 (C4f)) and Νικόδωρος Λιλαιευacuteς who in 337 / 6 witnessed the Phokians' payment of the fine imposed in 346 ( IG ix . 1 111 . 14 = CID ii 38 ). Lilaia is not mentioned by Hdt. 8 . 33 , 35 , among the cities destroyed by the Persians in 480 . Several commentators have suggested a topographical or historical explanation for the absence of Lilaia from Herodotos' list. For Valckenaer's unconvincing conjecture Λιλαιέων instead of MSS Αιολιδέων at Hdt. 8 . 35 , see supra 409 . Some have taken Herodotos' omission of Lilaia as proof that, in 480 , the city was part of Doris and had joined the other Dorian cities in siding with the Persians (Hdt. 8 . 31 ; cf. Leake ( 1835 ) ii. 89 -90 ). A slightly modified version of this explanation has induced Williams ( 1972 ) 16 -18 to interpret the coins inscribed ΛΙ as an autonomous issue struck immediately after the Persian invasion. But the coins are federal, and the precise dating is questionable, although stylistic criteria do point to a date in C5f ( infra ). The coins, the dioikismos in 346 , and the recording of a Lilaian witnessing the payment of the Phokians'fine in 337 / 6 ( IG ix . 1 111 ) are sufficient proof that Lilaia was a member of the Phokian koinon in C5 and C4 . Consequently, the inclusion of Lilaia as one of a Dorian hexapolis must be abandoned (Rousset ( 1989 ) 224 -25 ). After the dioikismos of 346 (Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 ) Lilaia was refounded (Paus. 10 . 33 . 3 ). Stamped tiles of the Heltic period (C3 ?) inscribed ΛΙΛΑΙΕΩΝ have been found in the sanctuary of Artemis at Erochos,from which Robert and Robert ( BE ( 1978 ) 236 ) inferred that a sympoliteia had resulted in the incorporation of Erochos (no. 181 ) into Lilaia. In this context it may be worth noting that Lilaia is the only Phokian polis that had two eponymous officials, as attested in a series of documents of C3l ( F.Delphes iii . 4 133 -35 ). Later documents mention only one eponymous archon ( F.Delphes iii . 2 125 (C2s)). Lilaia bordered to the south on the foothills of Parnassos, to the east on a declivity dominating a small valley beneath which was the source of the river Kephisos. The lower town was presumably situated here (Frazer ( 1898 ) 411 -14 ; Dassios ( 1992 ) 29 -30 no. 5 ). Today only the uppermost part of the circuit wall is preserved (plan in Tillard ( 1911 ) 70 ). It is a kind of acropolis, and its connection with the circuit wall enclosing the lower town can no longer be determined. It is in isodomic masonry, with bevelled joints, and cannot be dated with certainty. A date after 338 was suggested by Tillard ( 1911 ) 75 , a date c. 356 -46 by Ober ( 1992 ) 163 -64 . The wall is mentioned in connection with the siege of Lilaia by Philip V in C3l (Paus. 10 . 33 . 3 ). It is uncertain, however, whether Archaic Lilaia was situated here. On a hill c. 1 km north-west of the C4fortifications are remains of a wall in polygonal masonry, perhaps of C6 , covering an area of c. 100 by 60 m (Keramopoulos ( 1917 ) 53 (C6 ?); Kase et al . ( 1991 ) 53 pl. 4 . 14 and 35 ; Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 3 ). Sherds of the early, middle and late Helladic periods have been found as well (Lazenby and Hope Simpson ( 1970 ) 44 ; Teiresias ( 1979 ) 19 -27 ). Rather than a second-order settlement depending on Lilaia (Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 3 ), this site may well be Archaic Lilaia. Such a hypothesis is supported by the fact that excavations of the Classical site of Lilaia have produced no material of the Archaic period ( ArchDelt 33 ( 1978 ) B 1 , 154 -64 ). The hypothesis disproves the topographical argument adduced by Tillard ( 1911 ) 63 in order to explain the absence of Lilaia from Herodotos' account at 8 . 33 -35 ( supra ). Pausanias mentions an agora and a theatre, both undated ( 10 . 33 . 4 ). The source of the river Kephisos was traditionally located at Lilaia (Hom. Il . 2 . 523 ; Theopomp. fr. 385 ; Paus. 9 . 24 . 1 ). It was the object of a cult performed by the Lilaians (Paus. 10 . 8 . 10 ), and a priest of Kephisos is mentioned in the documents of C3l mentioned above ( F.Delphes iii . 4 133 -35 ). A retaining wall in polygonal masonry near the source of the river may be dated to C6 (Frazer ( 1898 ) 414 ). Some silver coins, usually dated to the period 480 -421 , were struck by the Phokian koinon , but instead of ΦΟ the legend is ΛΙ , probably an abbreviated form of Λιλαιέων , indicating that they were struck for Lilaia in particular. Denominations: triobol, diobol and obol on the Aiginetan standard. Types: obv . bull's head facing; rev . head of nymph or forepart of wild boar; legend: ΛΙ (Head, HN ² 343 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 3 : 349 -50 nos. 420 -21 )."
186,Medeon (Medeonios),Phokis,38.2,22.4,394,1953,"186 . Medeon (Medeonios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 20 , long. 22 . 40 . Size of territory: probably 2 . Type: B. The toponym is Μεδεών -ῶνος , οasper ( Syll . ³ 667 . 36 (C2 or C2f); Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 ; Steph. Byz. 439 . 19 ). The city-ethnic is Μεδεώνιος ( CID ii 37 . 3 -4 (C4s); SGDI 2057 . 2 (C2e)). Medeon is not called a polis in any Archaic or Classical source, and the first explicit attestation of a πόλις Μεδεωνίων is in a C2e sympoliteia agreement between Medeon and Stiris (no. 193 ) ( Syll . ³ 667 . 6 (C2 or C2f); cf. Migeotte ( 1984 ) no. 28 ); but Medeon is retrospectively attested as a polis in the urban sense at Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 , where it is listed among the Phokian cities dioikised in 346 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in an inscription of 322 recording the Phokians' payment of the fine imposed in 346 ( CID ii 108 . 1 : [ Μεδε ] ώνιοι ) and internally in the C2f sympoliteia agreement ( supra ). For the individual and external use, see Θρασυacuteβουλος Αισχρίωνος Μεδεώνιος , the archon of the Phokian koinon in 342 ( CID ii 37 . 3 -4 ). The fate of the city in 346 as well as the federal archon of 342 ensure that Medeon was a member of the Phokian koinon . There is no other public act of Medeon than the C2sympoliteia agreement according to which Medeon disappears as a polis and becomes a phratria of Stiris. The defence circuit surrounding the town of Medeon is built in an unparalleled type of regular polygonal masonry, with three towers in the north-western part (Camp ( 2000 ) 42 ). It measures 200 m (east-west) by 150 m (north-south) (Vatin ( 1969 ) 4 fig. 4 ). On the top of the hill are numerous terraces on which are the remains of some (public?) buildings. The cemetery was abandoned in C3m, according to Robert and Robert ( BE ( 1970 ) 310 ) in connection with the sympoliteia which was probably entailed by a synoikismos . Only ruins were left in the time of Pausanias ( 10 . 36 . 6 )."
187,Neon (Ne(-)) /Tithorea (Tithoreus),Phokis,38.35,22.4,1067,5064,"187 . Neon (Ne(-)) /Tithorea (Tithoreus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 35 , long. 22 . 40 . Size of territory: probably 2 . Type: A. The older toponym is Νέων (Hdt. 8 . 32 . 1 ) or Νεών (Paus. 10 . 2 . 4 ) or Νέωνες (Dem. 19 . 148 ) or Νεῶνες (Androtion ( FGrHist 324 ) fr. 23 ; Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 ; cf. Harding ( 1994 ) 119 -20 ). The corresponding city-ethnic is attested only in abbreviated form (as ΝΕ ) on some C5 coins ( infra ). Steph. Byz. 473 . 11 suggests the forms Νεώνιος and Νεωναῖος . The later toponym is Τιθορέα , ηasper (Hdt. 8 . 32 , cited by Paus. 10 . 32 . 8 -9 , in both sources designating a summit of Parnassos).At Paus. 10 . 32 . 9 the toponym is taken to designate first the region and later the town, replacing the older toponym of Νεών . The form Τιθόρα is attested both in texts and in inscriptions (Plut. Sull . 15 . 5 (rC1 ); IG ix . 1 190 . 2 ( 2 nd century ad )). Τιθόρρα ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 29 , Oulhen (C2f)) and Τιθυacuteρρα ( CID ii 131 . 9 (C3 )) are variant forms found only in inscriptions. The city-ethnic is Τιθορρευacuteς , attested only in inscriptions ( IG XI. 1 99 . 3 (C3l)); Τιθορευacuteς is attested both in inscriptions and in literary texts ( IG ix . 1 66 . 25 (C2m); Paus. 10 . 32 . 11 ). Τιθορεευacuteς is attested once (Paus. 9 . 17 . 4 ). Neon is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 8 . 32 . 1 and 8 . 33 and, retrospectively, at Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 and 32 . 9 , in both authors in connection with Xerxes' invasion of Phokis in 480 , when Neon was burnt to the ground. Pausanias mentions Neon as a polis in the urban sense in connection with the battle of Neon in 354 ( 10 . 2 . 4 ) and also in connection with the dioikismos of the Phokian cities in 346 after the Third Sacred War ( 10 . 3 . 2 -3 ). The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested in abbreviated form ( ΝΕ ) on C5 coins ( infra ). All attestations of the city-ethnic Τιθο ( ρ ) ρευacuteς are Heltic or later ( supra ). The problem of whether Tithorea was built on the top of the ruins of Neon depends on how one interprets Hdt. 8 . 32 . 1 and the slightly different story told by Plut. Sull . 15 . 5 and Paus. 10 . 32 . 9 . Pace Leake ( 1835 ) ii. 79 and Ulrichs ( 1863 ) 119 , the preferable solution is, with Tillard ( 1911 ) 56 -60 , to follow the account found in Pausanias: (a) in 480 Tithorea was the name of the peak of the mountain towering over the polis of Neon (Hdt. 8 . 32 . 1 ; Paus. 10 . 32 . 9 ); (b) the toponym Tithorea came to designate the surrounding region, i.e the territory of the polis of Neon (Paus. 10 . 32 . 9 : αasperπάσηsubiotaη τηsubiotaηtilde χώρΩsubiotaα ); (c) the polis of Neon, demolished in 346 , took the name of Tithorea when it was refounded on the same site by people returning from their temporary residence in the surrounding villages (Paus. 10 . 32 . 9 : ανΩsubiotaωκίσθησαν αποgrave τῶν κω µ ῶν ). It follows that the attempts to locate Neon somewhere in the Kephisos valley must be abandoned (Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 26 , who identifies Neon with Palai Thiva; see Pedieis (no. 189 )). The date of the refoundation is not known, and the earliest attestations of the new toponym ( CID ii 131 ) and city-ethnic ( IG ix . 1 99 ) are of C3 . The federal coins inscribed ΝΕ , as well the fate of the city in 346 , ensure that Neon was a member of the Phokian koinon . The classification of Tithorea as a Boiotian polis at Steph. Byz. 623 . 14 is probably just a mistake: the Theban occupation of Neon during the Third Sacred War, from 354 to 349 , was apparently not followed by a political annexation of the city (Paus. 10 . 2 . 4 ; Dem. 19 . 148 ; Buckler ( 1989 ) 44 -45 , 100 -11 ). The events of 349 (Dem. 19 . 148 ) suggest that the city was fortified, but the remains of fortifications still visible may well be of a later date. The north-eastern part of the wall with its towers is in a fine state of preservation, and the date is much debated (after 338 : Tillard ( 1911 ) 59 -61 , 75 ; Winter ( 1971 ) 158 ; c. 356 -46 : Ober ( 1992 ) 163 -64 ). A deep gorge lay immediately west of the town, and the town was protected by a defence circuit on the northern and eastern sides only. The wall was built in isodomic masonry with interval towers, ten of which are still visible. The wall enclosed an area of max. c. 580 m (north-south) × 250 m (east-west). Paus. 10 . 32 . 10 mentions a peribolos wall enclosing an ancient agora.He also mentions several undated sanctuaries and the tomb of Antiope and Phokos ( 10 . 17 . 4 , 32 . 10 ). According to legend, the region of Phokis was named after Phokos, who settled at Tithorea (Paus. 2 . 4 . 3 , 29 . 3 , 10 . 1 . 1 ). Some silver obols, usually dated to the period 480 -421 , were struck by the Phokian koinon , but with the legend ΝΕ on the reverse, probably an abbreviated form of the cityethnic, indicating that they were struck for Neon in particular.

188,Parapotamioi (Parapotamios),Phokis,38.35,22.5,785,3803,"188 . Parapotamioi (Parapotamios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 35 , long. 22 . 50 . Size of territory: probably 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Παραποτά µ ιοι , οιasper (Hdt. 8 . 33 ; Strabo 9 . 3 . 16 ; Paus. 10 . 3 . 1 ); the form Παραποτα µ ία , ηasper is attested only twice (Strabo 9 . 3 . 16 and Steph. Byz. 503 . 4 ), and dates from a time when Parapotamioi had disappeared as a city and denoted a geographical area only. The city-ethnic is Παραποτά µ ιος ( Hell. Oxy . 21 . 5 ; Paus. 10 . 33 . 8 (r 586 )). In the Homeric Catalogue of Ships the line οιasper τ ' άρα παρ ' ποτα µ οgraveν Κηφισοgraveν έναιον ( Il . 2 . 522 ) is commonly interpreted as a periphrastic reference to the Parapotaimoi (Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 , contra 10 . 33 . 7 ). The pseudo-ethnics ' Επικηφίσιοι (schol. Hom. Il . 2 . 522 ) and Παρακηφίσιοι (Steph. Byz. 707 . 6 ) are derived from the line in Homer and have no independent authority. All indisputable attestations of the cityethnic are in literary sources, and at SEG 3 408 . 7 [ Τ ] αρα [ ν ] τ [ ίνωι ] could be proposed as a possible alternative to [ Π ] αρα [ πο ] τ [ α µ ίωι ]. Parapotamioi is called a polis in the urban sense by Hdt. 8 . 33 in connection with Xerxes' invasion of Phokis in 480 , when Parapotamioi was burnt to the ground, and by Paus. 10 . 3 . 1 -2 in connection with the dioikismos in 346 . It is implicitly called a polis by Hell . Oxy. 21 . 5 in connection with the Boiotian campaign into Phokis in 395 , where polis is used in the urban sense with the political sense as a possible connotation (Hansen and Nielsen ( 2000 ) 146 ). The collective and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in Hell . Oxy . 21 . 5 . The only attestation of the individual and external use is Pausanias' mention of an Αιχ µ έας Παραποτά µ ιος , allegedly a victor in the first Pythian Games of 586 ( 10 . 33 . 7 ). The merging of the toponym and the city-ethnic makes it difficult to distinguish between attestations of the city-ethnic (found at Hell . Oxy . 21 . 5 : ηasper τῶν Παραποτα µ ίων χώρα ) and the toponym (found at Plut. Sull . 16 . 12 : ηasper ακρόπολις τῶν Παραποτα µ ίων ). Parapotamioi was situated on the north-western side of a hill called ' Ηδυacuteλειον , at a strategic point controlling the access to the Kephisos valley and close to the frontier of Phokis (schol. Dem. 19 . 148 , nos. 313 -14 c, Dilts; cf. DavieroRocchi ( 1993 )). Owing to its strategic position, it repeatedly became the battleground where the Phokian and Boiotian armies clashed during the Third Sacred War (Theopomp.fr. 385 = Strabo 9 . 3 . 16 ; schol. Dem. 19 . 20 , no. 73 b, Dilts; cf. Plut. Sull . 16 . 8 ). At Hell . Oxy . 21 . 5 the territory is referred to as ηasper τῶν Παραποτα µ ίων χώρα . According to Theopomp. fr. 385 , Parapotamioi bordered on the poleis of Ambryssos (no. 171 ), Phanoteus (no. 190 ) and Daulis (no. 176 ). (Ambryssos is a mistake, but so far no satisfactory emendation has been suggested (Fossey ( 1986 ) 69 ; Marcotte ( 1988 ) 489 ; cf. the comment in the Budé edn. ad loc .). Parapotamioi was never rebuilt after the dioikismos in 346 , but its population was distributed between the other poleis refounded in the 330 s by the Boiotians and Athenians (Paus. 10 . 33 . 8 (rC4s); cf. Plut. Sull . 16 . 12 ; Strabo 9 . 3 . 16 ). The polis ceased to exist, and its territory was presumably divided among some or all of the neighbouring poleis . Parapotamioi had a small defence circuit of c. 100 m × 80 m (Fossey ( 1986 ) 69 -71 ; Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 51 ). The wall was built of small stones in Lesbian polygonal masonry. The workmanship is undistinguished, and the wall is difficult to date (Frazer ( 1898 ) 419 ; Fossey ( 1986 ) 69 ). This defence circuit was retrospectively described as the akropolis of Parapotamioi by Plut. Sull . 16 . 12 ."
189,Pedieis (Pedieis),Phokis,38.4,22.4,533,2704,"189 . Pedieis (Pedieis) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 40 , long. 22 . 40 , but see infra for a discussion of the unresolved location. Size of territory: probably 2 (if identified with Palaia Phiva). Type: A. The toponym is Πεδιεῖς , οιasper (Hdt. 8 . 35 ; Hell. Oxy . 21 . 5 ). The city-ethnic is Πεδιευacuteς ( CID ii 5 . ii . 54 : Πε [ διε ] ῖς ( 373 -346 )). Pedieis is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 8 . 33 in connection with Xerxes' invasion of Phokis in 480 , when the town was burnt to the ground, and it is listed as a polis in the political sense in the Delphic naopoioi accounts, where the Pedieis appear as contributors in a list dated between 373 and 346 ( CID ii 5 . ii . 55 ) and headed by the formula: ταίδε τῶ µ πολίων ήνικαν ( ii . 25 -26 ). This list testifies to the collective and external use of the city-ethnic. In 395 the Boiotians overran the plain round Elateia and Pedieis (no. 189 ), and the population settled in the plain ( Hell. Oxy . 21 . 5 ). Pedieis is not listed by Pausanias among the poleis exposed to dioikismos in 346 ; but that Pedieis was still a member of the Phokian koinon in C4f can be inferred from the Boiotian attack in 395 and the occurrence of the city-ethnic in CID ii 5 . ii . 54 : Φωκεῖς Πε [ διε ] ῖς ), dated between 373 and 346 . The presumption is that Pausanias omitted the city from his list by mistake, and that it disappeared for good in 346 (cf. Parapotamioi (no. 188 )). But, depending on the date of CID ii 5 , Pedieis may have disappeared earlier, which would also explain Pausanias'silence.For some historians'unconvincing link between Ledon (no. 184 ) and Pedieis, see supra 420 . Pedieis is still unlocated. The toponym as well as the account of Hell . Oxy . indicate that the city was situated in the plain, and probably adjacent to Elateia (no. 180 ). In Hdt. 8 . 33 , Pedieis is placed between Neon (no. 187 ) and Triteis (no. 196 ), itself an unlocated town. Consequently, Pedieis is normally identified with the ancient site of Palaia Phiva (Schober ( 1924 ) 38 ; Klaffenbach ( 1937 ); Barr .). The remains described by early travellers are no longer visible (Ulrichs ( 1863 ) ii. 119 ; Frazer ( 1898 ) 407 ; Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 26 ): viz . a quadrangular defence circuit with a side of c. 790 m and interval towers, semicircular on the outside and rectangular on the inner side. Such a description does not fit an Archaic wall,and accordingly Klaffenbach ( 1937 ) preferred to identify this site with the later site of Ledon (Paus. 10 . 33 . 1 ). But that remains a doubtful hypothesis. The recently described defence circuit at Vourlia (Rousset ( 1999 ) no. 16 ) is an alternative candidate according to Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 20 ."
190,"Phanoteus, Panopeus (Phanoteus, Panopeus)",Phokis,38.3,22.5,1110,5307,"190 . Phanoteus, Panopeus (Phanoteus, Panopeus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 30 , long. 22 . 50 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Πανοπευacuteς (Hom. Il . 2 . 520 ; Ps.-Skylax 61 ; Ephor. fr. 31 a), οasper (Paus. 10 . 4 . 2 ), ηasper ( Etym . Magn . 111 . 25 ) or, in the plural, Πανοπεῖς (Hdt. 8 . 34 ; Strabo 9 . 3 . 12 = Ephor. fr. 31 b) or Φανοτευacuteς (Thuc. 4 . 89 . 1 ; Strabo 9 . 3 . 14 ) or Φανατευacuteς ( CID i 9 .D. 29 -30 (C4m); IG vii 3376 . 9 (C2 )). A variant form, Φανοτεία , is exclusively attested in late authors (Polyb. 29 . 12 . 7 ; Livy 32 . 18 ). For other forms invented by the grammarians, see Steph. Byz. 657 . 17 -18 . The city-ethnic is identical with the toponym, and is either Πανοπευacuteς (Hdt. 8 . 35 . 1 ; Theopomp. fr. 385 ) or Φανοτευacuteς ( Hell . Oxy . 21 . 5 ; CID ii 24 . ii . 14 (C4s); SEG 42479 . 4 (C3 )) or Φανατευacuteς ( SGDI 1770 . 1 (C2f); IG vii 3376 . 12 (C2 )). According to Strabo 9 . 3 . 14 , Πανοπευacuteς is the older, and Φανοτευacuteς the later, form of the toponym, and the same observation applies to the cityethnic. Πανοπευacuteς is found in literary sources only, Φανοτευacuteς both in literary sources and in inscriptions, whereas Φανατευacuteς is an epichoric variant form attested exclusively in inscriptions. At SEG 3 345 . 3 , the restoration of [ Παν ] οπεῖα is not beyond suspicion. Phanoteus is called a polis in the urban sense, with the political sense as a connotation, at Hdt. 8 . 35 . 1 in connection with Xerxes' invasion of Phokis in 480 , when the town was burned to the ground (Hansen ( 2000 ) 175 -76 ), and at Hell . Oxy . 21 . 5 in connection with the Boiotian campaign into Phokis in 395 (Hansen and Nielsen ( 2000 ) 146 ). The urban sense occurs at Ps.-Skylax 61 and, retrospectively, in Paus. 10 . 3 . 1 -2 in connection with the dioikismos in 346 . The collective and external use of the city-ethnic is found at Hdt. 8 . 35 . 1 ; Hell . Oxy . 21 . 5 ; SEG 42 479 . 4 (C3 ). The individual and external use is applied to the Phokian from Phanoteus who in 424 told the Lakedaimonians about the Athenian plan to attack Boiotia (Thuc. 4 . 89 . 1 ) and to an exile who in C4s contributed to the rebuilding of the temple in Delphi ( CID ii 24 . ii . 14 ). The territory of Phanoteus is called ηasper Φανοτίς at Thuc. 4 . 76 . 3 , and is designated by the toponym at Hdt. 8 . 34 ; it is indirectly termed χώρα at Hell. Oxy . 21 . 5 . Phanoteus is the easternmost polis of Phokis, bordering on Boiotian Chaironeia (no. 201 ) (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 3 ; Plut. Lys . 29 . 4 (rC4e); Paus. 9 . 40 . 12 ). A C3 inscription lays down the frontier between Phanoteus and Stiris (no. 193 ), situated south of Mt. Helikon ( SEG 42 479 ), and according to Strabo 9 . 3 . 14 , Phanoteus bordered on 'the region round Lebadeia' (no. 211 ). In 395 the body of Lysandros was carried over the frontier of Boiotia and buried in the territory of Phanoteus (Plut. Lys . 29 . 4 ), testimony of Lakedaimonian alliance with Phokis in general rather than with Phanoteus in particular. The Boiotian attack on Phanoteus in 395 , as well as the dioikismos in 346 , ensure that the polis belonged to the Phokian koinon in C4 . Membership in C5 , too, is to be assumed, but there is no explicit evidence (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 3 , 89 . 1 ). The eponymous hero of Phanoteus was Phanoteus,son of Phokos (Steph. Byz. 500 . 19 ; Paus. 2 . 29 . 2 ), and this foundation myth can be traced back to Archaic and Classical sources (Hom. Il . 23 . 665 ; Soph. El . 45 ; Pl. Ion 533 B, Resp . 620 C). Phanoteus is situated on a steep-sided hill measuring c. 600 m by 100 m, described as an άκρα by Polyb. 5 . 96 . 5 . From Hell . Oxy . 21 . 5 it can be inferred that the site was fortified in 395 . On the eminence are two types of remains: (a) on the southern slope is a stretch of a wall in 'cyclopean' masonry, often interpreted as traces of a Mycenaean acropolis (Lazenby and Hope Simpson ( 1970 ) 42 -43 ; Fossey ( 1986 ) 63 -64 ; cf. Hom. Il . 17 . 307 -8 ; Paus. 10 . 4 . 2 ); (b) apart from stretches where the escarpment offers sufficient protection, the entire hill is enclosed by a defence circuit, with eight interval towers on the western and southern sides. The length of the peribolos was seven stades according to Paus. 10 . 4 . 2 . The wall was built partly in irregular trapezoidal masonry, unique in Phokis, and partly in isodomic masonry (Kirsten ( 1949 a) 641 -47 ; Fossey ( 1986 ) 63 -64 ). A part of the wall may correspond to an internal diateichisma . This fortification, of which the western and southern parts are well preserved, cannot be dated with certainty: Camp ( 2000 ) 45 suggests the late 340 s; but according to Winter ( 1971 ) it is 'post Chaironeian' , see supra 401 . The early travellers describe a section of a wall which is no longer visible, perhaps the defence circuit of the lower town (Leake ( 1835 ) ii. 110 -11 ; Frazer ( 1898 ) 218 ; Camp et al . ( 1997 ) 267 n. 29 ). The occupation of the suburbs ( proastion ) by the Boiotians, mentioned at Hell . Oxy . 21 . 5 , indicates that the lower town was unfortified in 395 . The famous passage in Paus. 10 . 4 . 1 about the absence of public buildings of Phanoteus in his own time carries no weight as evidence for the Archaic and Classical periods (Alcock ( 1995 ) 326 -27 )."
191,Phlygonion (P(h)lygoneus),Phokis,38.3,22.45,658,3346,"191 . Phlygonion (P(h)lygoneus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 30 , long. 22 . 45 . Size of territory: probably 2 . Type: B. In literary sources the toponym is Φλυγόνιον , τό (Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 (rC4m); Steph. Byz. 668 . 11 ; cf. Phlegya at Plin. HN 4 . 7 . 12 ). The variant form Φλυγονία , suggested by Steph. Byz. 668 . 12 , is either a mere invention of the grammarians or a misinterpreted form of the name of the territory. In inscriptions of C3l and C2e the city-ethnic is invariably Πλυγονευacuteς ( SGDI 2049 (C3l); for a list of attestations, see Daux ( 1936 ) 234 -58 ; Lerat ( 1952 ) i. 59 -60 ), but in a C2m regulation of the frontiers the city-ethnic is Φλυγονευacuteς ( F.Delphes iii . 2 136 . 22 ) or Φλυγωνευacuteς ( F.Delphes iii . 2 136 . 29 ). The only attestation of the cityethnic in an inscription of the Classical period is restored, viz . [ Φλυγ ] ονεῖς or [ Πλυγ ] ονεῖς in CID ii 108 . 10 ( 322 ). Φλυγονιευacuteς and Φλυγόνιος are found only in Steph. Byz. 668 . 12 and are presumably invented by the grammarians. Phlygonion is recorded in Pausanias'list of poleis exposed to dioikismos in 346 ( 10 . 3 . 2 ). Pausanias' information is confirmed by the Delphic accounts, where the Phlygonians ([ Φ / Πλυγ ] ονεῖς ) are recorded among the Phokian communities that paid the annual fine ( CID ii 108 . 10 ( 322 )). Both sources ensure that Phlygonion belonged to the Phokian koinon in C4 . The collective and external use of the cityethnic is attested in this inscription. The individual and external use is attested in the Delphic manumission inscriptions of C3l/C2e ( SGDI 2049 . 3 , 20 ). The existence of two different city-ethnicsviz . Πλυγονευacuteς versus Φλυγονευacuteς derived from Φλυγόνιον -has for a long time induced commentators to postulate the existence of two different cities: the Phokian city of Φλυγόνιον inhabited by the Φλυγονεῖς , and the Lokrian city of * Πλυγόνιον , an unattested toponym derived from the city-ethnic Πλυγονευacuteς (Schober ( 1924 ) 39 -40 ; Daux ( 1936 ) 234 -58 ; Lerat ( 1952 ) i. 59 -61 ; contra Colin at F.Delphes iii . 2 136 ), but both city-ethnics do in fact denote the same city (Rousset ( 1999 ) 43 n. 37 and ( 2002 ) 20 -27 ). Although the Persians must have passed Phlygonion on their march in 480 from Phanoteus to Delphi, the city is absent from Herodotos' list at 8 . 35 . But no argument from silence can be based on this chapter. The dioikismos of Phlygonion in 346 (Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 ), as well as the Phlygonians' contribution to the fine in 322 ( CID ii 108 ) ensure that Phlygonion was a member of the Phokian koinon . The inscriptions of C2f show that, in 191 / 90 , all Phlygonians had become Delphians (Daux ( 1936 ) 252 -53 ). The C2m regulation of the frontiers between the Delphians (no. 177 ) and, on the other hand, the Ambryssians (no. 171 ) and Phlygonians shows that the two latter cities by then were united in a sympoliteia ( F.Delphes iii . 2 136 ). The ruins at Bania, where *Aiolidai has often been located (no. 170 ), are to be identified with Phlygonion (Robert and Robert, BE ( 1941 ) 8 ; Rousset ( 1999 ) 43 n. 37 , ( 2002 ) 45 ). At the site is a small defence circuit in isodomic masonry, but its poor state of preservation does not allow of any more precise description (Schober ( 1924 ) 22 ; Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 113 ; Rousset ( 2002 ) 63 no. 69 )."

The preamble of a payment in 337 / 6 of the fine imposed on the Phokians in 346 lists as one of the archons of the Phokians a Κρίτωνος Πο [----] ου ( CID ii 38 . 5 ). The letters Πο [----] ου must be a city-ethnic in the genitive case, but no other source testifies to a Phokian city whose city-ethnic fits Πο [. . . 4 -5 . . .] ος . So far no satisfactory restoration or emendation has been suggested.J.Bousquet's suggestion at CID ii 38 is unconvincing. The place called Πουacuteρεον ( Syll . ³ 826 . iii . 34 = F.Delphes iii . 4 280 .C. 34 ) from which he derived Πο [ υρεάτ ] ου is certainly not the name of a community.We have a choice among four possibilities: (a) an error by the mason; (b) a dialectal variant of a well-known Phokian ethnic Π / Βο [ υλιδί ] ου ; (c) an ethnic of an unlocated polis of central Greece called Πο [ ταναί ] ου (Lerat ( 1952 ) i. 62 -64 , contra Rousset ( 2002 ) 15 , 38 ); or (d) an ethnic of an otherwise unknown Phokian polis ."

The toponym is Στῖρις , -ιος ( Syll . ³ 647 . 24 (C2f); Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 (r 346 )) or Στεῖρις ( IG IX. 1 36 . 1 (C2f); Plut. Cim . 1 . 9 ). The city-ethnic is Στίριος ( SGDI 1727 . 6 (C2f); Syll . ³ 647 . 15 ) or Στείριος ( SEG 42 479 . 3 (C3l); Syll . ³ 647 . 5 ). The variant form Στιριευacuteς is attested once in an inscription of the Roman Imperial period ( IG ix . 1 48 . 7 (third century ad ), and Στιρίτης is found once (Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 ). Neither the toponym nor the city-ethnic is attested prior to the Heltic period; but Stiris is listed by Paus. 10 . 2 . 3 as one of the poleis exposed to dioikismos in 346 , which shows that, in C4m,it was a member of the Phokian koinon . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a sympoliteia agreement with Medeon (no. 186 ) of C2f? ( Syll . ³ 647 ) and externally in a C3 inscription which regulates the frontier between Stiris and Phanoteus (no. 190 ; SEG 42 479 (C3l)). The individual and external use is found in a Delphic manumission inscription of C2f ( SGDI 1727 ). Paus. 10 . 35 . 10 records a sanctuary of Demeter Stiritis with a temple in mudbrick in which was a very old image of the goddess. The epithet indicates that Demeter was the protective divinity of Stiris. Stiris is situated on a low rocky hill, c. 700 m long and 100 m across. Along the east side are the remains of an undated defence circuit in isodomic masonry (Fossey ( 1986 ) 32 -33 ; Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 75 ; McInerney ( 1999 ) 319 -20 )."

As attested in inscriptions,the toponym is Τείθρων ( SEG 1 198 . 5 (C4l/C3e); SEG 16 351 . 3 ( c. 200 ); SGDI 1983 . 3 -4 (C2e)); in literary sources it is Τεθρώνιον , τό (Hdt. 8 . 33 most MSS; Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 ) or Τεθρόνιον (Hdt. 8 . 33 , RSV) or Τιθρώνιον (Paus. 10 . 33 . 12 ; Steph. Byz. 624 . 6 ). On Θρόνιον at Ps.-Skylax 61 , see Nielsen ( 2000 ) 107 -8 . The city-ethnic is Τειθρώνιος ( CID ii 108 . 7 , 322 ; SGDI 1983 . 13 (C2e); in CID ii 5 . ii . 50 (C4f) it is combined with the regional ethnic: Φωκεῖς Τειθρώνιοι ). Teithronion is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 8 . 33 and, retrospectively, at Paus. 10 . 3 . 1 and 2 , in both passages in connection with Xerxes'invasion of Phokis in 480 , when the town was burned to the ground. Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 -3 treats Teithronion as a polis in the urban sense in connection with the dioikismos of the Phokian cities in 346 after the Third Sacred War.The city is listed as a polis in the political sense in the Delphic naopoioi accounts,where the Teithronioi appear as contributors in a list ( CID ii 5 . ii . 50 ) headed by the formula: ταίδε τῶ µ πολίων ήνικαν ( ii . 25 -26 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in one of the receipts of the Phokian fine ( CID ii 108 . 7 ( 322 )), and internally in a proxeny decree of C3 -C2 ( IG ix . 1 222 . 10 ); the individual use is attested externally in a C4 -C3 proxeny decree from Delphi (no. 177 ) ( SEG 1 198 . 5 ). The dioikismos of Teithronion in 346 (Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 ), as well as the city's contribution in 322 to the payment of the fine ( CID ii 108 . 7 ), ensure that Teithronion was a member of the Phokian koinon . Teithronion is situated north of the river Kephisos at a bend of the river which surrounds the southern part of the city. It was protected by a defence circuit ( c. 400 × 200 m) in pseudo-isodomic masonry, with interval towers (Frazer ( 1898 ) 422 -23 ; Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 14 ). Tithorea (Tithoreus) See 187 .

The toponym is Τραχίν , ηasper (Strabo 9 . 3 . 14 ) or Τραχίς (Paus. 10 . 3 . 2 ). The only attestation of a city-ethnic is at Strabo 9 . 3 . 14 : οιasper δ ' ενοικουtildeντες Τραχίνιοι . Neither the toponym nor the city-ethnic is attested prior to the Heltic period; but Trachis is listed by Paus. 10 . 2 . 3 as one of the poleis exposed to dioikismos in 346 , which shows that, in C4m,it was a member of the Phokian koinon . The location of Trachis is unknown. The only indication is provided by Strabo,who places Trachis near Lebadeia (no. 211 ) ( 9 . 3 . 14 : πλησίον δεgrave Λεβαδείας καιgrave ηasper Τραχίν ). This piece of evidence leaves us with a choice between three different sites: Kyriaki (Fossey ( 1986 ) 35 -39 ; Barr .), KastroTseresi (Tillard ( 1911 ) 66 -68 ; Fossey ( 1986 ) 54 -56 ; Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 62 ) and Korakolithos (Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 57 ; McInerney ( 1999 ) 300 -2 ). Kastraki should probably be identified with Helikonioi ( supra 403 ). At Kastro-Tseresi there is a small enclosure of roughly triangular shape, but only the north-western side of c. 100 m and the north-eastern side of c. 180 m are fortified. The longer southern side is protected by steep cliffs. The wall is in rusticated isodomic masonry which cannot antedate the Classical period,and no traces of the Archaic period have been found. Thus, the identification with *Aiolidai as proposed by Tillard ( 1911 ) 66 -68 is dubious, whereas the site might fit Trachis (Rousset ( 1999 ) 43 n. 46 , but more cautiously ( 2002 ) 45 -46 ). The topographic information found in Strabo,however,makes a third site a better candidate: viz . Korakolithos. A small eminence is all that is still visible (Fossey ( 1986 ) 59 ; Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 57 ), but the existence of a settlement is indicated by a C5f-C2f cemetery found c. 1 km to the west ( ArchDelt 33 ( 1978 ) 152 ). Furthermore, Lolling mentions the remainsno longer visible-of a defence circuit of 240 'paces' ( = 200 m?) with the foundations of a tower. However, the regulation of the frontier between Phanoteus (no. 190 ) and Stiris (no. 193 ) ( SEG 42 479 ) is not easily compatible with a C3 polis situated at Korakolithos; cf. the map in Rousset and Katzouros ( 1992 ) 211 ."
196,Triteis,Phokis,,,313,1627,"196 . Triteis Map 55 . Unlocated. Type: A. Triteis is known exclusively from one passage in Herodotos: at 8 . 35 , enumerating the Phokian poleis burnt down by the Persians in 480 , Herodotos records Τριτεῖς between Pedieis (no. 189 ) and Elateia (no. 180 ). The city is not mentioned in any other source (Lerat ( 1952 ) i. 51 n. 7 ). At 8 . 32 . 2 Herodotos tells us that many Phokians found refuge at Amphissa (no. 158 ) in Lokris, and Steph. Byz. 637 . 16 reports that there was a Τρίτεια situated between Phokis and West Lokris. On the basis of these two pieces of evidence Oldfather ( 1939 ) suggests that Lokrian Tritea, attested from C5m only, may have been founded by Triteians coming from Phokis; but cf. Klaffenbach ( 1937 ). The location of Triteis is discussed by McInerney ( 1999 ) 281 -83 . The text of Herodotos suggests a location west of Elateia, which has induced some scholars to identify Triteis with the fortified enclosure at Modi (Lolling ( 1989 ) 90 ; Schober ( 1924 ) 43 ). But the chronology of this small fortification fits Ledon (no. 184 ) better than Triteis. Alternatively, Triteis has been located between Modi and Elateia at the village of Turkochorion-Panagitsa (Kirsten ( 1951 ) 741 no. 106 , followed by Dakoronia, ArchDelt ( 1979 ) 194 ). T o date, however, the only remains found there are of a cemetery used from the Geometric to the Classical period ( ArchDelt 34 ( 1979 ) 193 -94 , 36 ( 1981 ) 222 , 43 ( 1988 ) 232 -33 , 44 ( 1989 ) 221 ). The recent discovery of a fortification 2 km south-east of Modi (Dassios ( 1992 ) no. 20 ; cf. supra Pedieis) invites a reassessment of the issue."
197,Troneia (Troneieus),Phokis,38.45,22.4,606,3137,"197 . Troneia (Troneieus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 45 , long. 22 . 40 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: B. The toponym is Τρώνεια , ηasper , attested in a Delphic manumission act to designate the place of origin of the slave ( SGDI 2132 . 3 ( 188 / 7 )). Steph. Byz. 213 . 16 and Hdn. iii . 1 276 . 35 both mention a Γρώνεια , πόλις Φωκίδος . This Γρώνεια is usually interpreted as a misreading of Τρώνεια (Robert ( 1960 ) 74 -75 ; cf. supra 403 , s. v. Groneia). The masculine form of the city-ethnic has become an issue. In an inscription of 322 recording the Phokians'payment of the fine imposed in 346 ( CID ii 108 ), one of the contributing communities is recorded as [---] ΤΡΩΝΕΙΕΙΣ ( 9 ), usually interpreted as the city-ethnic Τρωνειεῖς . But an equally possible restoration is [--Πα ] τρωνειεῖς , derived from the toponym Πατρωνίς attested in Plut. Sull . 15 . 6 (Robert ( 1960 ) 75 ). Patronis, however, seems to be a ghost toponym ( supra 404 ), from which it follows that the Troneieis are in fact attested in the inscription. The only sources to classify Troneia as a polis are Steph. Byz. and Herodian (accepting the conjecture Τρώνεια for Γρώνεια ). Furthermore, Troneia is absent from Pausanias' list of poleis exposed to dioikismos in 346 ( 10 . 3 . 1 -2 ), but its contribution to the fine in 322 ensures that it was a member of the Phokian koinon and undoubtedly a polis . The external use of the city-ethnic is attested collectively in the payment of 322 ( CID ii 108 . 9 ). The individual and external use of the city-ethnic can be deduced from a manumission of C2s in which the origin of a slave is recorded as τοgrave γένος Τρωνίδα ( SGDI 2130 . 3 ). Paus. 10 . 4 . 10 mentions a part of the territory of Daulis (no. 176 ) called Τρωνίς in which was situated the shrine of a founder hero, either Xanthippos or Phokos, who reappears in a second century ad inscription from Daulis ( IG ix . 1 61 . 50 ). This Tronis is undoubtedly the name of the territory of the city of Troneia, and the presumption is that, in the time of Pausanias, Troneia had been incorporated into Daulis (Robert ( 1960 ) 78 -80 ). Interpreting the three sources (Paus. 10 . 4 . 10 ; Plut. Sull . 15 . 6 ; IG ix . 1 61 ), all commentators agree that Troneia should be located in the neighbourhood of Daulis, and two identifications have been suggested: (a) Kato Tseresi, south of Daulis, and (b) Ag. Marina west of Daulis. Re (a): the historians who distinguished Troneia from Patronis suggested the site of Kato Tseresi lying south of Daulis (Kirsten ( 1939 )). Considering that this site can be identified with a small fort only, Robert ( 1960 ) 78 -82 cautiously suggested a location somewhat south of Daulis ( contra McInerney ( 1997 ) 197 -99 ). Re (b): a preferable site for Troneia has been proposed by historians who identify Patronis with Troneia (Tillard ( 1911 ) 64 -66 ; Kirsten ( 1951 ) 713 ; cautiously Fossey ( 1986 ) 53 ; Barr .) and thus follow the topographical indication given by Plut. Sull . 15 . 6 . This site is identified with Patronis by historians who, wrongly in my opinion, distinguish between Troneia ## II. The Poleis"
198,Akraiphia (Akraiphieus),Boiotia,,,1204,5924,"198 . Akraiphia (Akraiphieus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 25 , long 23 . 15 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Ακραίφια , τά ( IG vii 4135 . 6 (C3s), 2871 . 1 (C1 )) or (in literary sources only) Ακραιφία , ηasper (Hdt. 8 . 135 . 1 ; Steph. Byz. 63 . 1 ), Ακραιφίαι (Strabo 9 . 2 . 27 ), Ακραίφνιον ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 ), Ακραίφνια (Theopomp. fr. 362 ). The toponym denotes either the town (Hdt. 8 . 135 ) or the polity ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 ). The city-ethnic is Ακραιφιευacuteς (Ducat ( 1971 ) no. 260 = SEG 31 393 (C5f)) or (in literary sources only) Ακραιφνιευacuteς (Theopomp. ( FGrHist 115 ) fr. 362 ); Ακραίφνιος , Ακραιφνεώτης (Ephor. fr. 229 ). Akraiphia is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 8 . 135 . 1 ) and in the political sense ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a dedication from Ptoion ( LSAG 93 and 95 no. 13 ; SEG 22 430 (both C6l)) and externally on a boundary stone of C4f-C3m ( IG vii 2792 ; cf.Vottéro ( 2001 ) 115 ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a dedication: Πυθίας οκραιφ [ ιευacuteς ] ( LSAG 93 and 95 no. 15 ( c. 500 )) and externally in a list of aphedriateuontes ( IG vii 2724 a. 2 ( c. 280 -270 )). An inscription of C4f-C3m cut in the rock near Vristika marked the border between Akraiphia and Kopai (no. 209 ) as determined by the Boiotians ( IG vii 2792 ; SEG 36 411 ; Lauffer ( 1986 ) 136 ; Vottéro ( 2001 ) 115 ), and, similarly, a C6 horos (Vottéro ( 2001 ) 117 ) probably records the border between the two poleis ( SEG 30 440 , 42 407 ): [h όρος Α ] κραι [ φιέον κ ] αιgrave Κο [ παίον ]. The size of the territory has been assessed at c. 35 km ² (Fossey ( 1988 ) 264 , 198 ). The eponymous official of Akraiphia was an archon ( LSAG 93 and 95 no. 13 (C6l)). In C4e Akraiphia was united with Chaironeia (no. 201 ) and Kopai, and constituted one of the eleven Boiotian districts ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 ). The principal body of government was a boule to which only propertied citizens were admitted ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 2 , 3 ). There is no explicit evidence for membership of the Second Federation whereas the attestation of an aphedriateuon from Akraiphia testifies to membership of the Third Federation ( IG vii 2724 .a. 2 ( c. 280 -270 )). An eponymous archon is attested in C6s ( LSAG 93 , 95 no. 13 ). The protecting god of Akraiphia was perhaps Zeus of some sort ( IG vii 2733 (C5 ); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) iii. 93 -95 ); cf. the C6l-C5e dedication to Zeus Oporeus ( SEG 46 528 ). On Mt.Ptoion (Paus. 9 . 23 . 5 -7 ; Pind. frr. 51 b, 52 f), c. 4 km east of Akraiphia, was an oracular shrine (Hdt. 8 . 135 ; Pind. fr. 52 g.A), since C7m consecrated to Apollo Ptoieus (Ducat ( 1971 ) 89 no. 50 b ( c. 640 ); IG vii 27 -29 ( c. 640 -620 ), 4155 (C4l)) in association with a goddess and served by a male Akraiphian prophet ( IG vii 4155 ). The oracle was especially famous in C6s (Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 52 -73 ). Dedications of this period abound (Ducat ( 1971 ); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) iii. 295 ), including two by the Alkmaionids and Peisistratids ( IG i³ 1469 -70 ). At the sanctuary are remains of a peribolos , an oracular cave and a temple of C4l built on top of an older one (Lauffer ( 1959 ) 1528 -40 ). The sanctuary was controlled by Akraiphia in the Archaic period (Ducat ( 1971 ) 448 -50 ) as well as in the Heltic age ( IG vii 4139 . 20 -21 (C2l); Roesch ( 1982 ) 225 ff); but when the oracle was consulted by Mys in 479 , it was under Theban control (Hdt. 8 . 135 . 1 ; cf. Strabo 9 . 2 . 34 ). The Thebans may have dispossessed the Akraiphians of the oracle in C6s (Gullath ( 1989 ) 166 ), but a preferable explanation is that 'the oracle may have remained within the direction of Akraiphia, although formally the sanctuary and the territory of Akraiphia were under Theban control'(Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 69 ). Halfway (as the crow flies) between Akraiphia and the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoieus was a sanctuary of the Hero Ptoios, the descendant of Athamas, here worshipped in association with some goddess. A lower terrace has altars and a stoa of the Archaic period, the upper terrace a temple of C4l built over a C7edifice. Between the two levels is an avenue of monumental tripod bases, dedicated by the polis of Akraiphia c. 525 -450 ( IG vii 2734 -35 ; SEG 22 430 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) iii. 11 -21 ). The acropolis was fortified with a double-faced wall: an outer face of hard limestone in trapezoidal coursed masonry, perhaps of C4 , and an inner face of poros stone in ashlar coursed masonry,built in C3 and probably destroyed in 196 . A diateichisma in polygonal work is either contemporary with or older than the limestone wall. There are substantial remains of a pentagonal tower of the Heltic period.The circuit enclosed an area of c. 17 ha (Fossey ( 1988 ) 266 -68 ; Garlan ( 1974 ) 98 -112 and information from John Camp). The size of the lower town is unknown (Bintliff ( 1997 a ) 231 ) nor do we know whether there was a defence circuit enclosing the entire town. Buildings and streets have been uncovered at the western end of the town, and outside the town are four cemeteries with remains from the late Geometric, Archaic and Classical periods (Fossey ( 1988 ) 268 ). So far, more than 2 , 000 graves have been found ( AR ( 1999 -2000 ) 56 ). The settlement can be traced back to C8 (Fossey ( 1988 ) 269 ). Akraiphia struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard from c. 500 to 480 , from 456 to 446 , and from 386 (or earlier) to 374 (or later). Denominations: stater, obol, hemiobol, trihemitartemorion; obv . Boiotian shield; rev . kantharos in incuse square (some). Legend: Α (C5e) or ΑΚ (C5m) or ΑΚΡΗ (C4e) (Head, HN ² 344 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 3 . 257 -58 ; Schachter ( 1989 ) 85 ; Baldwin Brett ( 1955 ) 137 no. 1011 ; Etienne and Knoepfler ( 1976 ) 221 n. 768 suggest that the earliest issues may have been minted at (H)aliartos)."
199,Alalkomenai,Boiotia,38.25,23.0,388,1860,"199 . Alalkomenai Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 25 , long. 23 . 00 . Located at Vouno c. 1 km east of Solinarion (Knauss ( 1987 ) 42 -68 ). Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. The toponym is Αλαλκο µ εναί , αιasper (Strabo 9 . 2 . 27 ; Paus. 9 . 33 . 5 ). Apart from Steph. Byz. 68 . 19 , there is no attestation of a city-ethnic. The only author to call Alalkomenai a polis is Strabo, who retrospectively describes the site as a small polis situated in a plain ( 9 . 2 . 36 ). According to Paus. 9 . 33 . 5 , the settlement was just a κώ µ η . But it may deserve inclusion in this inventory of poleis because it seems to have had a territory of its own, and especially because of its famous sanctuary of Athena, τοgrave Αλαλκο µ ενεῖον (IG ix² . 1 170 . 5 (C4l-C3e)) dedicated to the cult of Αλαλκο µ ενηιgraveς Αθήνη (Hom. Il. 4 . 8 ; see Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 111 -14 ). According to Steph. Byz. 68 . 18 -19 , the goddess had the epithet Polias, and her cult was linked with that of Zeus Polieus (Etym. Magn. 56 . 8 -10 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) iii. 96 ). Since the sanctuary was in the lowlands (Paus. 9 . 33 . 5 ), the epithets Polias and Polieus must refer not to an acropolis cult but rather to cults of divinities protecting the polis (cf. Cole ( 1995 ) 301 -3 ). The cult of Athena at the Alalkomenion was presumably an old one (Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 12 ), which would indicate that at least in the Archaic period Alalkomenai was probably a polis (Hansen ( 1995 a ) 32 -33 ) with the cult of its protecting god located in an extra-mural sanctuary. Later Alalkomenai was incorporated into Koroneia (no. 210 ). The territory is called Αλαλκο µ ενία ; it must have been very small, but at least it included the fortified mountain Tilphosion (Ephor. fr. 153 ; Diod. 19 . 53 . 7 ). The Alalkomenion was located c. 300 m north of Alalkomenai (Knauss ( 1987 ) 50 )."
200,Anthedon (Anthedonios).,Boiotia,38.3,23.25,662,3285,"200 . Anthedon (Anthedonios). Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 30 , long. 23 . 25 . Size of territory: 2 . Type:A.The toponym is Ανθηδών , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 508 ; Ps.-Skylax 59 ; Archestratos fr. 15 . 1 ; I.Stratonikeia 508 . 43 (C1 )). The city-ethnic is Ανθηδόνιος (Palaiphatos 27 ; IG ix² . 1 27 . 4 (C3 )), in the Boiotian dialect: Ανθαδόνιος ( IG vii 2723 . 4 (C3e)). Anthedon is called a polis in the urban sense in a C4mythological treatise (Palaiphatos 27 ) and again in Heracl. Cret. ( 23 , CGM i . 104 (C3s)); that it was a polis in the political sense as well is apparent from the fact that Αριστοκλεῖς Αγασιήω Ανθαδόνιος appears c. 285 -280 among the aphedriateuontes ( IG vii 2723 . 4 ). That its status as a polis in the political sense stems at least from the beginning of the Third Federation (i.e.from 338 ) is indicated by the eight victories at the four major Panhellenic games won c. 300 by the pankratist Nikon of Anthedon (Steph. Byz. 96 . 17 -18 ; Phlegon of Tralles ( FGrHist 257 a) = P Oxy . 2082 4 . 27 ; see Knoepfler ( 1986 a ) 602 -3 ). In Ps.-Skylax 59 Anthedon is described as a teichos , but it is unclear whether he took it to be a polis as well. The only epigraphical reference to Anthedon as a polis is a heavily restored proxeny decree of C3 ( SEG 36 413 = Knoepfler ( 1986 a ) 624 -30 . The individual and external use of the city-ethnic is attested at IG vii 2723 . 4 (C3f); Plut. Mor . 300 F: Μυρτιgraveς ηasper Ανθηδονία ποιήτρια (rC5 ); and Steph. Byz. 96 . 18 -19 Λεωνίδης Ζωγράφος , Ευφράνορος µ αθητής , Ανθηδόνιος (rC4 ). The territory is called ηasper Ανθηδονία (Strabo 9 . 2 . 13 ) and its size has been assessed at c. 85 km ² (Fossey ( 1988 ) 250 ). Anthedon bordered on Tanagra (no. 220 ) to the south-east (Nicocrates ( FGrHist 376 fr. 1 ) and on Thebes (no. 221 ) to the south-west (Heracl. Cret. 23 , GGM i . 104 ). Herakleides tells us that the soil was poor and that almost all the inhabitants lived as fishermen (Heracl. Cret. 23 , GGM i . 104 ; cf. Archestratos fr. 15 . 1 ). Although there is no explicit evidence, it is usually assumed that Anthedon belonged to Thebes (no. 221 ) and that its harbour was used as a naval base by the Thebans when in the 360 s they built a fleet (Schläger et al. ( 1968 -69 ) 90 ), but see Fossey ( 1992 ) 117 -20 ). The attestation of an aphedriateuon from Anthedon testifies to membership of the Third Federation ( IG vii 2723 . 4 ( c. 280 -270 )). The protecting god of Anthedon was probably Zeus Karaios and Anthas, whose cult, however, is unattested before C2 ( IG ii² 2360 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) iii. 97 and letter of Dec. 1994 ). The ancient town lay beside the sea around a tiny harbour (Strabo 9 . 2 . 13 ; Schläger et al . ( 1968 -69 )).A separately fortified hill about 30 m high was used for the acropolis. On the north side of the hill are the remains of a Heltic (Roesch ( 1976 )) fortification wall built in ashlar masonry with interval towers. The city walls encompassed both the hill and the harbour and enclosed an area of 30 ha (Wallace ( 1979 ) 58 ; Bintliff ( 1997 a ) 244 ). Herakleides mentions an agora flanked with two stoas. The settlement can be traced back to the Neolithic period, and there are remains of the Geometric, Archaic and Classical periods (Fossey ( 1988 ) 255 )."
201,Chaironeia (Chaironeus),Boiotia,38.3,22.55,1020,4915,"201 . Chaironeia (Chaironeus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 30 , long. 22 . 55 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Χαιρώνεια , ηasper (Thuc. 1 . 113 . 1 ; F.Delphes iii . 3 96 = SEG 32 529 ( c. 313 -300 )), but in some Boiotian inscriptions Χ [ η ] ρώνια ( IG vii 3170 . 10 (C3 )) or Χαιρωνήα ( SEG 38 380 . 1 (C1 )). The toponym denotes either the town (Thuc. 1 . 113 . 1 ) or the polity ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 ) or the territory (Lycurg. 1 . 16 ). The city-ethnic is Χαιρωνευacuteς ( SEG 15 282 . 4 ( 263 -255 )). Chaironeia is called a polis presumably in the urban sense (Hecat. fr. 116 ; cf. Hansen ( 1995 a ) 55 n. 44 ) and in the political sense (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 3 , 89 . 2 ; cf. Hansen ( 1995 a ) 21 -24 ; Theopomp. fr. 407 ; Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ). The term πόλισ µ α is used by Aristophanes Boeotus ( FGrHist 379 ) fr. 3 (C4 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally as ΧΑΙΡΩΝΕ on coins of C4e (Head ( 1881 ) 44 ) and externally by Polyb. 27 . 1 . 4 . For the individual use of the cityethnic, see e.g. Ευρυφάοντος Καλλίφρονος Χαιρωνέως ( SEG 15 282 . 4 , grammateus ( 263 -255 )). The territory is called Χαιρώνεια (Lycurg. 1 . 16 : ηasper εν ΧαιρωνείΩsubiotaα µ άχη ), and it was the westernmost region of Boiotia, bordered by Phokis to the west (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 3 ; cf. Hecat. fr. 116 ) and by Orchomenos (no. 213 ) to the north (Plut. Cim . 2 . 1 ). In C5f its territory was a part of the territory of Orchomenos (inference from Hdt. 8 . 34 . 1 ). The size of the territory has been assessed at c. 55 km ² (Fossey ( 1988 ) 342 ). In C5 Chaironeia was a dependent polis under Orchomenos ( πόλιν ' Ορχο µ ενίων : Theopomp. fr. 407 , probably referring to 446 ; ες ' Ορχο µ ενοgraveν ξυντελεῖν : Thuc. 4 . 76 . 3 , referring to 424 ), and was perhaps without any representation in the federal government. In 395 , however, Chaironeia was united with Akraiphia (no. 198 ) and Kopai (no. 209 ), and constituted one of the eleven Boiotian districts ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 ). It is not known when Chaironeia changed its status from an Orchomenian dependency to one of the six poleis that provided one Boiotarch every third year. The principal body of government was a boule , to which only propertied citizens were admitted ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 2 , 3 ). Chaironeia was a member of the Second Federation ( επιβοηθεῖν , Diod. 16 . 39 . 8 ) and of the Third Federation as well ( IG vii 2724 c. 6 ( 245 -240 )). After 457 Chaironeia and Orchomenos served as a refuge for oligarchs from the other Boiotian poleis (Hellan. fr. 81 ); but in 446 Chaironeia was conquered by the Athenians and exposed to andrapodismos (Thuc. 1 . 113 . 1 ; Theopomp. fr. 407 ). From the abortive attempt in 424 to introduce a democracy, we can infer that Chaironeia must have had an oligarchic constitution. The democratic faction was supported by Athens and by some Orchomenians, but the stasis was quelled by armed assistance from the other Boiotians (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 2 -3 , 89 . 2 ; Hansen ( 1995 a ) 21 -24 ). Chaironeia must have been fortified in 424 (Thuc. 4 . 89 . 2 ) and again in 354 when the town was besieged by Onomarchos (Diod. 16 . 33 . 4 ; cf. Buckler ( 1989 ) 56 ). On the acropolis there are remains of ( 1 ) a circuit of cyclopean masonry, probably of the Archaic period; ( 2 ) Lesbian blocks, presumably Archaic; ( 3 ) a C4 ashlar circuit. Small extensions at the north-east corner of the cyclopean wall and at the north-west corner of the ashlar wall suggest that the lower city in the Archaic and Classical periods was walled and lay north of the acropolis. The acropolis walls enclose an area of c. 15 ha. The size of the lower city is unknown (Fossey ( 1988 ) 376 -79 ); Bintliff's guesstimate is c. 23 ha (( 1997 a ) 244 ). The settlement can be traced back to the early Helladic period (Fossey ( 1988 ) 380 ). Of public architecture the only known building is a small rock-cut theatre. A rectilinear koilon with eight steps, probably of the Classical period, was replaced in the early Heltic period by a curvilinear koilon of which fifteen steps are preserved (Dilke 45 ( 1950 ) 35 -37 ; Isler ( 1994 ) 146 ). The protecting god of Chaironeia may have been Zeus (Paus. 9 . 41 . 6 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) iii. 99 ). Other major divinities presumably worshipped in the Archaic and Classical periods are Apollo Thourios (Plut. Sulla 17 . 7 , interpreted retrospectively by Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 43 -44 ) with an extra-urban sanctuary at Thourion (Camp et al . ( 1992 ) 454 -55 ), Dionysos (Plut. Cim . 2 . 2 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 173 -74 ) and Herakles (Plut. Dem . 19 . 2 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) ii. 2 ). Chaironeia struck hemidrachms on the Aiginetan standard and bronze coins between 386 (or earlier) and 374 (or later). ( 1 ) Silver: obv . Boiotian shield; rev . club. Legend: ΧΑΙ .

202,Chorsiai (Chorsieus),Boiotia,38.15,22.55,595,3138,"202 . Chorsiai (Chorsieus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 15 , long. 22 . 55 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym Κορσιαί , αιasper (Dem. 19 . 141 codd. AY; Harp. Κ 77 ; Ps.-Skylax 38 ) is attested in literary sources, and from the city-ethnic Χορσιευacuteς ( SEG 3 342 ; Migeotte ( 1984 ) no. 11 (C2e)) we can infer that in the Boiotian dialect the toponym must have been Χορσιαί , which is the spelling offered by Steph. Byz. at 696 . 1 , and perhaps attested in the Delphic list of theorodokoi of c. 230 -210 ( SEG 36 500 ). It has been suggested that the Κορσιαί referred to by Demosthenes must be Κορσεία in north-west Boiotia near East Lokris (Etienne and Knoepfler ( 1976 ) 32 -41 ), but Demosthenes' mention of Orchomenos (no. 213 ), Koroneia (no. 210 ) and Tilphoseion side by side with Κορσιαί , as well as the notes in Harp. and Ps.-Skylax, strongly support the traditional location of the site in southern Boiotia. Ps.-Skylax 38 lists Chorsiai as the first toponym after the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense, and the settlement is presumably called a polis by Theopomp.fr. 167 = Harp. Κ 77 , quoting Dem. 19 . 141 for the toponym and Theopompos for the site-classification. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in a treaty with Thisbai ( SEG 3 342 (C2e)) and internally in a proxeny decree ( SEG 22 410 (C2f)). There is no attestation of the individual use. The name of the territory is unknown; its size has been assessed at c. 40 km ² (Fossey ( 1988 ) 186 ). A C4f inventory of hestiatorion equipment, presumably found in Chorsiai, indicates that Chorsiai in C4e was a dependent polis lying inside the territory of Thespiai (no. 222 ) ( SEG 24 361 , 30 441 ( 386 -380 ), but cf. 47 520 ). The inscription testifies to a Heraion and a cult of Hera in Chorsiai (Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 238 ). For a possible cult of Zeus Soter, see SEG 36 417 (C6 -C4 but heavily restored: Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) iii. 99 -100 ). In 346 Chorsiai was destroyed by the Thebans, had its walls demolished and, like Orchomenos and Koroneia, the city was perhaps exposed to an andrapodismos (Dem. 19 . 141 ). The epigraphical and archaeological evidence shows that the city was soon resettled. The only reference in written sources to walls is ωχυρω µ ένος at Diod. 16 . 58 . 1 , describing the Phokians'occupation of Chorsiai during the Sacred War down to 346 . Remains of a coursed trapezoidal wall enclosed both the acropolis and the lower town on the east, north and west sides, whereas the south side was protected by cliffs. This circuit seems to date from the years after the battle of Leuktra; it was probably destroyed by the Thebans in 346 (Dem. 19 . 141 ), but re-erected later on in C4 in isodomic ashlar work. The walls enclose residential quarters of c. 1 ha (Büsing and Büsing-Kolbe ( 1972 ) 79 -87 ; Fossey ( 1986 ). According to Bintliff ( 1997 a ) 244 , the habitation area amounted to between 1 . 7 and 4 . 5 ha. The settlement can be traced back to the early Helladic period, and there are remains of the Geometric, Archaic and Classical periods (Fossey ( 1988 ) 193 )."
203,Erythrai,Boiotia,38.15,23.25,504,2408,"203 . Erythrai Map. 54 . Lat. 38 . 15 , long. 23 . 25 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. The toponym is ' Ερυacuteθραι , αιasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 499 (for the accent see schol. ad loc .); Thuc. 3 . 24 . 2 ), denoting either the town (Eur. Bacch . 751 ) or the polity ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 ). There is no attestation of the toponym in epigraphical sources, and the only attestation of a city-ethnic is ' Ερυθραῖος Παντία [ ς ] ( SEG 30 457 (C6l); cf. Fossey ( 1991 ) 181 -89 ; Hansen ( 1995 a ) 46 -47 ; for the sequence ethnicname, see IG vii 2796 ). But [ ∆ ] η µ αρέτ [ η Μ ] οιρίχου [ ' Ε ] ρυθραί [ α ] ( IG ii² 8500 = SEG 14 194 (C4s)) may come from Boiotian Erythrai too, since Μοίριχος is a good Boiotian name, and since the stele was found in Eleusis, where several other sepulchral inscriptions commemorating Boiotians have been found (Koumanoudis ( 1961 ) 104 ). The only reference in ancient literature to Erythrai having been a polis is Pausanias' remark: ' Υσιῶν καιgrave ' Ερυθρῶν ερείπιά εστι . πόλεις δέ ποτε τῶν Βοιωτῶν ηtildeσαν ( 9 . 2 . 1 ). Pausanias' retrospective site-classification is supported by two observations: (a) in 479 Erythrai had a territory which must have been very small (Hdt. 9 . 15 . 3 , 25 . 2 : οasper ' Ερυθραῖος χῶρος ), and (b) a sympoliteia with Plataiai (no. 216 ) in C5m suggests that Erythrai had been a polis before it joined the sympoliteia and may perhaps still have been a dependent polis even after the union ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ; Hansen ( 1995 a ) 16 ) by which its territory seems to have become a part of Plataiïs (Strabo 9 . 2 . 24 ). Erythrai must have been annexed by Thebes (no. 221 ) before the synoecism of c. 431 when its population was moved to Thebes ( Hell. Oxy . 20 . 3 ; Demand ( 1990 ) 83 -85 ; Moggi, Sin . 197 -204 ). By 395 , however, Erythrai had been repopulated, but was still lying within the territory of Thebes ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ). The acropolis was fortified by an undated defence circuit of rubble with no pretence to style enclosing an area of 1 , 600 m ² (Fossey ( 1988 ) 117 -18 ). A wall of the lower town 'is only visible as a line in the fall of the land'(letter from Fossey,Jan. 1995 ). The walls are probably later than 431 , when Erythrai is described as unfortified ( Hell. Oxy . 20 . 3 ). Apart from a few LH iii sherds, the settlement cannot be traced further back than the Classical period (Fossey ( 1988 ) 118 )."
204,Eteonos/Skaphai (Skaph(l)eus),Boiotia,,,404,2011,"204 . Eteonos/Skaphai (Skaph(l)eus) Map 55 . Unlocated. Type: C. The toponym was originally ' Ετεωνός , οasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 497 ; Strabo 9 . 2 . 24 ), but it was changed into Σκαφαί , αιasper ( Hell. Oxy. 20 . 3 ) or alternatively Σκαφλαί ( IG ii² 11654 (C4m); Strabo 9 . 2 . 24 , erroneously emended Σκάρφη by all eds.). The change of name may perhaps be connected with the refoundation of the town in c. 400 after the synoecism with Thebes (no. 221 ) in c. 431 . We know that Eteonos/Skaphlai was located near Skolos (no. 219 ) and occupied a hill (Hom. Il . 2 . 497 ) in the Parasopia (Strabo 9 . 2 . 24 ), but the precise location is unknown (Fossey ( 1988 ) 130 -31 ). Apart from Steph. Byz. ( 283 . 8 ), Eteonos/Skaphai is never called a polis , and the reasons for including the site in this inventory are (a) that a city-ethnic is attested in Classical sources (Hansen ( 1995 a ) 28 , 48 ) and (b) that a sympoliteia with Plataiai in C5m suggests that Eteonos/Skaphlai had been a polis before it joined the sympoliteia and may perhaps still have been a dependent polis even after the union ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ; Hansen ( 1995 a ) 16 ). Skaphai was one of the small unwalled settlements whose population was moved to Thebes ( Hell. Oxy . 20 . 3 ) in connection with the major synoecism at the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War (Demand ( 1990 ) 83 -85 ; Moggi. Sin . 197 -204 prefers a date c. 426 -424 ). Apart from Steph. Byz. 283 . 10 , there is no attestation of a city-ethnic derived from the toponym Eteonos,but the cityethnic Σκαφ ( λ ) ευacuteς is attested in three Attic sepulchral inscriptions of C4 : IG ii² 11202 : Σακφλευacuteς (C4f); SEG 15 161 : Σκαφλικά , Σκαφλικαί (C4m, Eleusis); SEG 22 191 : Σκαφλικαί (C4s, Eleusis); cf. also SEG 22 192 (second and third centuries ad ). The only other attestation is in Men. Dysc . hypoth. 14 : υasperπεκρίνατο Αριστόδη µ ος Σκαφευacuteς . Cf. IG ii² 11654 : εΣκαφλάων (C4m) (Koumanoudis: α &lt; ί &gt; ων , but see δραχ µ αων in IG vii 3055 . 4 )."
205,Eutresis (Eutretidieus),Boiotia,38.15,23.15,279,1370,"205 . Eutresis (Eutretidieus) Map. 54 . Lat. 38 . 15 , long. 23 . 15 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. The toponym is Ευacuteτρησις , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 502 ; Eust. Il . 1 . 409 . 20 , van der Valk; Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 , where the toponym denotes the polity). The only surviving attestation of the city-ethnic is in a Heltic dedication to Apollo: Ευτρειτιδιεῖες Απόλλωνι ( BCH 28 ( 1904 ) 430 -31 no. 1 ). Strabo calls Eutresis a κω µ ίον Θεσπιέων ( 9 . 2 . 28 ), and in Steph. Byz. ( 287 . 21 ) it is classified as a kome . Eutresis is not called a polis in any extant source, but the reference at Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 to what was probably a sympoliteia between Thespiai (no. 222 ), Thisbai (no. 223 ) and Eutresis suggests that Eutresis during the First Federation was a dependent polis dominated by Thespiai (Siewert ( 1977 ) 463 ; Hansen ( 1995 a ) 16 ); cf. τοῖ Θεσπιέσσιν καιgrave τοῖρ συgraveν αυτοgraveς ( SEG 31 358 . 5 (C5f)).The attestation of the city-ethnic further suggests that Eutresis was still a polis in the Heltic period during the Third Federation. Excavations have revealed a part of a circuit wall. Its compartment construction has been taken to suggest a C4m date (Fossey ( 1988 ) 152 ), and it enclosed an area of between 13 and 20 ha (Bintliff ( 1997 a ) 244 ). The settlement can be traced back to the Neolithic period (Fossey ( 1988 ) 152 )."
206,Haliartos (Haliartios),Boiotia,38.25,23.05,1198,5827,"206 . Haliartos (Haliartios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 25 , long. 23 . 05 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Αρίαρτος , οasper (Armenidas ( FGrHist 378 ) fr. 7 ) or Αλίαρτος , οasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 503 , cf. PLond . Lit. 6 ; Lys. 16 . 13 ; IG vii 2850 (C2 -C1 )), denoting either the town (Diod. 14 . 81 . 2 (r 395 )) or the territory (Xen. Hell . 3 . 5 . 17 ). In Boiotia the city-ethnic is either Αριάρτιος ( SEG 25 554 (C5 ); Etienne and Knoepfler ( 1976 ) 221 -25 ) or Αλιάρτιος ( IG vii 2724 . 4 -5 ( c. 280 -270 )); outside Boiotia it is always Αλιάρτιος (Thuc. 4 . 93 . 4 ). For the late appearance of the form Αasperλιάρτιος , see most recently Knoepfler ( 1992 ) 480 -81 . Haliartos is listed as one of the Boiotian poleis in Thucydides'description of the battle of Delion ( 4 . 91 . 1 , 93 . 4 ). It is called a polis in the urban sense by Heracl.Cret. 25 ( GGM i . 104 (C3 )) and in the political sense by the Oxyrhynchus historian ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ). The term [ πο ] λιτεία (citizenship) in a proxeny and citizenship decree of C4l ( SEG 28 453 . 8 ) strongly supports Knoepfler's restoration [ ταtildeς πόλιος Αριαρτίων ] in lines 3 -4 of the decree ( BCH 102 ( 1978 ) 381 , pace Fossey in Boeotia Antiqua 4 ( 1994 ) 49 -51 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the reverse of a coin of C4f ( ΑΡΙΑΡΤΙΟΝ : Head, HN ² 345 ; see Etienne and Knoepfler ( 1976 ) 222 n. 771 ) and externally in a C5 dedication found near Onchestos ( SEG 25 554 ). For the individual and external use,see [ Αasperλι ] άρτιος ( CID ii 94 . 5 ), a hieromnemon of 327 . The territory was called Αasperλίαρτος (Xen. Hell . 3 . 5 . 17 ) or Αasperλιαρτία (Strabo 9 . 2 . 33 ; Paus. 9 . 33 . 4 ). Together with Lebadeia (no. 211 ) and Koroneia (no. 210 ), Haliartos constituted one of the eleven Boiotian districts ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ). The size of the territory has been assessed at c. 80 km ² (Fossey ( 1988 ) 300 ). It comprised Onchestos (Strabo 9 . 2 . 33 ; SEG 25 554 ; Etienne and Knoepfler ( 1976 ) 223 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) ii. 206 ), Tilphossa and Okalea, as well as Medeon (Strabo 9 . 2 . 26 ). A line of fortifications, now dated to 371 (Fossey ( 1992 ) 112 -14 ), indicates the border of the city towards Koroneia (Fossey ( 1988 ) 320 ). The Cambridge/Bradford survey of Boiotia has revealed that there is a band of almost empty territory running east-west just north of Askra,probably the border zone between the territory of Haliartos and that of Thespiai (no. 222 ) (Snodgrass ( 1990 ) 129 ). The Thebans' remark at Hdt. 5 . 79 . 2 that the Koroneians and Thespians are their neighbours indicates that Haliartos in 507 / 6 was a dependent polis and situated in what was then the territory of either Koroneia or Thebes. Haliartos was a member of the First Federation ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ), and the principal body of government was a boule to which only propertied citizens were admitted ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 2 , 3 ). Haliartos was a member of the Third Federation; it provided one of the hieromnemones in 327 ( CID ii 94 . 5 ) and one of the aphedriateuontes in c. 280 -270 ( IG vii 2724 b. 2 ). We have no evidence relating to the Second Federation. In C4l Haliartos seems to have awarded proxenia and politeia to a citizen from an unknown polis ( SEG 28 453 , restored). On the acropolis have been found the remains of an Archaic sanctuary with a stoa (Coulton ( 1976 ) 240 ) and a temple of Athena (C7 -C6 ), and the protecting god of Haliartos was probably Athena Itonia ( SEG 32 456 . 8 -9 , cf. 44 408 (C3l); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 116 ). Cults of Dionysos, Alkmene and the hero Aleas have been inferred from Plut. Lys . 28 (Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 9 -10 , 11 -12 , 176 ). A small circuit of cyclopean masonry (Mycenaean?) with Lesbian (Archaic?) and trapezoidal (Classical?) repairs encloses the acropolis. An ashlar circuit, probably of C4 , encloses the lower city and covers an area of c. 42 ha (Fossey ( 1988 ) 301 -5 ; Bintliff ( 1997 a ) 244 ). Haliartos was fortified when attacked by Lysandros in 395 / 4 (Xen. Hell . 3 . 5 . 17 -19 ; Diod. 14 . 81 . 2 ; Paus. 3 . 5 . 3 -5 ). All three passages refer to a circuit wall enclosing the whole city and not just the acropolis. Haliartos seems to have been an early Iron Age settlement located in and round the acropolis, and from there it spread down the slope to the south. The settlement can be traced back to the Neolithic period (Fossey ( 1988 ) 305 -6 ). The urban centre reached its maximum size in C4 (Bintliff and Snodgrass ( 1988 ) 61 -65 ). An important Classical cemetery outside Haliartos is reported in AR ( 1999 -2000 ) 56 . Haliartos struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard from c. 456 to 446 and from c. 400 (or earlier) to 374 (or later), and bronze coins from c. 338 to 315 .

Boeotia 187 ). The Archaic coins inscribed with an epichoric H and traditionally assigned to Haliartos are now believed to have been struck by Hyettos (no. 207 ; Etienne and Knoepfler ( 1976 ) 218 -26 ). Conversely, Etienne and Knoepfler ( 1976 ) 221 n. 768 suggest that the C5e issues usually ascribed to Akraiphia (no. 198 ) may have been minted at (H)aliartos)."
207,Hyettos (Hyettios),Boiotia,38.35,23.05,718,3584,"207 . Hyettos (Hyettios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 35 , long. 23 . 05 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: [A]. Apart from the Latinised version in Plin. HN 36 . 128 , the toponym /asperacuteΥηττος , οasper is attested in two late sources only: Paus. 9 . 24 . 3 -4 , 36 . 6 and Steph. Byz. 646 . 14 -15 . But the personal name /asperacuteΥηττος (Hes. fr. 257 (C7 -C6 )) implies that the toponym goes back to the Archaic period. The city-ethnic is ' Υέτιος ( SEG 24 300 (C6s)), ' Υείττιος ( IG vii 1673 . 4 ( c. 240 )), ' Υέττιος ( IG vii 416 . 78 (C1 )) or ' Υήττιος ( IG vii 2833 . 4 ( c. ad200 )). The earliest explicit reference to Hyettos as a polis is in a military catalogue of c. 250 ( SEG 26 498 . 3 -4 ). But other evidence implies that Hyettos was a polis in the Archaic and Classical periods as well. (a) SEG 24 300 (C6s): Θεβαῖοι τ ˜ ον h υετίον inscribed on a greave and undoubtedly commemorating a Theban victory over the Hyettans. (b) Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 : δυacuteο δεgrave παρείχοντο βοιωτάρχας ' Ορχο µ ένιοι καιgrave ' Υήττιοι (conj. Wilamowitz; Etienne and Knoepfler ( 1976 ) 230 : MS ' Υσιαῖοι ), which shows that in c. 400 Hyettos was one of the poleis that participated in the running of the federal administration; cf. 19 . 2 : παρ ' εasperκάστηsubiotaη τῶν πόλεων . Further evidence of the close relations between Hyettos and Orchomenos (no. 213 ) is provided by a public dedication of c. 400 set up by the Orchomenians on the acropolis of Hyettos (now lost but seen in 1938 by M. Feyel, BCH 62 ( 1938 ) 165 n. 5 ; Etienne and Knoepfler ( 1976 ) 228 -29 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the coins if is an abbreviation of h υετίον ( infra ), and externally in the Theban dedication SEG 24 300 (C6s). The individual and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in a list of aphedriateuontes : . . . Αριστο µ άχω ' Υειττίω : IG vii 1673 . 4 ( c. 240 ). The name of the territory is unknown; its size has been assessed at c. 55 km ² (Fossey ( 1988 ) 292 ). During the First Federation, Orchomenos and Hyettos constituted two of the Boiotian districts and provided two Boiotarchs ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ). The difference in size between the two cities indicates that, like the other small poleis around Lake Kopais, Hyettos provided one Boiotarch every third year and Orchomenos all the others (Etienne and Knoepfler ( 1976 ) 229 -33 ). The principal body of government was a boule to which only propertied citizens were admitted ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 2 , 3 ). Hyettos was a member of the Third Federation ( IG vii 1673 . 4 ( c. 240 )). There is no evidence concerning the Second Federation. The acropolis was fortified by a wall of Lesbian masonry dating from c. 500 with repairs of C4 and C2 . The circuit encloses an area of c. 6 ha. There are no traces of any wall around the lower city, which seems to have lain south and east of the acropolis (Etienne and Knoepfler ( 1976 ) 45 -65 ).A surface survey of the urban centre shows that it covered c. 26 ha (Bintliff ( 1999 ) 15 ). There are no traces of habitation antedating the Archaic period (Fossey ( 1988 ) 294 -95 ). Hyettos struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard from c. 500 to c. 480 . Denominations: stater, drachm, hemidrachm,obol,tetartemorion; obv . Boiotian shield; rev . mill-sail punch.

208,Hysiai,Boiotia,38.15,23.2,650,3053,"208 . Hysiai Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 15 , long. 23 . 20 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. The toponym is ' Υσιαί , αιasper (Hdt. 5 . 74 . 2 ; Eur. Bacch . 751 ), denoting the polity (Hdt. 6 . 108 . 6 ) or the town (Hdt. 9 . 15 . 3 ) or the territory (Thuc. 3 . 24 . 2 ). There is no attestation of the toponym in epigraphical sources, and the only attestation of a city-ethnic is in Steph. Byz. 653 . 9 . Apart from Pausanias' description of Hysiai as the ruins of what had once been a Boiotian polis ( 9 . 2 . 1 ), the only reference in ancient literature to Hysiai as a polis is in Harp. Υ 15 : ' Υσιαί , τηtildeς Βοιωτίας πόλις , quoting Hypereides' speech For Xenophilos (fr. 156 , Sauppe) for the toponym and Euripides' Antiope (fr. 180 , Nauck) for the site-classification, which, however, is applied to the Heroic Age and cannot be used as evidence for the status of Hysiai in the Archaic and Classical periods.The two main reasons for including Hysiai in this inventory are (a) that it had a territory of its own and (b) that it was placed right between Plataiai (no. 216 ) and the three small cities which are named by the Oxyrhynchus historian as συ µ πολιτευό µ εναι with Plataiai ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 ): viz . Erythrai (no. 203 ), Skolos (no. 219 ) and Eteonos/Skaphai (no. 204 ). This location strongly indicates that Hysiai must have been one of the small members of the sympoliteia not mentioned explicitly by the Oxyrhynchus historian but referred to in the phrase τῶν άλλων χωρίων , and thus Hysiai was presumably a polis , perhaps a dependent polis after it joined the sympoliteia . Hysiai had been annexed by Athens, probably in 519 , and was still part of Attika in 506 (Hdt. 5 . 74 . 2 , 6 . 108 . 6 ); but in 479 Hysiai was lying in Plataian territory (Hdt. 9 . 101 . 1 ), yet at the same time had a territory of its own which, however, must have been very small (Hdt. 9 . 25 . 3 , cf. 6 . 108 . 6 ) bordering on Plataiai to the west (Hdt. 9 . 15 . 3 , 25 . 3 ), Thebes to the north (Hdt. 6 . 108 . 6 ), Erythrai to the east (Hdt. 9 . 15 . 3 ) and Eleutherai to the south (Paus. 9 . 1 . 6 ). Later in C5 Hysiai seems to have been a member of the sympoliteia led by Plataiai ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ) and must accordingly have been a part of Plataiïs (cf. Paus. 9 . 2 . 1 ). A cult of Demeter is attested in inscriptions ( IG vii 1670 -71 (both C5e)) and in the sources for the battle of Plataiai, in which the sanctuary is described as that of Demeter Eleusinia (Hdt. 9 . 57 . 2 , 62 . 2 , 65 . 2 , 69 . 1 ; Plut. Arist . 11 . 6 ; Paus. 9 . 4 . 3 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 152 -54 ). Pritchett ( 1979 ) associated the sanctuary with some remains of C5e found in the plain near modern Pantanassa, but a location on the hills just north of modern Kriekouki was suggested by Wallace ( 1985 ) 97 -99 . Of the settlement itself, remains of a circuit wall (undated) could still be seen at Kriekouki in the early twentieth century (Fossey ( 1988 ) 113 ), and there are pottery and small finds of the Archaic and Classical periods (ibid. 114 )."
209,Kopai (Kopaieus),Boiotia,38.3,23.1,597,2896,"209 . Kopai (Kopaieus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 30 , long. 23 . 10 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: [A]. The toponym Κῶπαι , αιasper is attested in literary sources only (Hom. Il . 2 . 502 ; Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 , where it denotes the polity). The city-ethnic is Κωπαιευacuteς (Thuc. 4 . 93 . 4 ; IG vii 4149 . 15 (C1f)) or Κωπαῖος (Head, HN ² 344 (C4f)) or Κωπηtildeος ( IG vii 2792 (C4s)), which is the more common form in Boiotian inscriptions (Fossey in LCM 10 ( 1985 ) 39 ). Kopai is listed as one of the Boiotian poleis in Thucydides' description of the battle of Delion ( 4 . 91 . 1 , 93 . 4 ) and in the Oxyrhynchus historian's account of the federal constitution ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ), both passages using polis in the political sense. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally on a C4s boundary stone ( IG vii 2792 ) and internally on the reverse of a coin of C4f ( ΚΩΠΑΙΩΝ : Head, HN ² 344 ); the individual use is attested externally in a list of aphedriateuontes : Αρισστοκράτιος [ ' Ε µ ] τέδωνος Κωτ [ ή ] ω ( IG vii 2724 d. 5 ( c. 240 )) and internally in a Heltic grave epigram ( IG vii 2796 . 1 ). An inscription of c. 315 cut in the rock near Vristika marked the border between Kopai and Akraiphia (no. 198 ) ( IG vii 2792 ; SEG 36 411 ; Lauffer ( 1986 ) 136 ), and, similarly, a horos of the late Archaic period probably records the border between the two poleis ( SEG 30 440 ). The size of the territory has been assessed at c. 105 km ² (Fossey ( 1988 ) 264 ). In 395 Kopai was united with Akraiphia and Chaironeia (no. 201 ) and constituted one of the eleven Boiotian districts ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ). The principal body of government was a boule , to which only propertied citizens were admitted ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 2 , 3 ). There is no explicit evidence concerning the Second Federation, but Kopai was a member of the Third Federation ( IG vii 2724 d. 5 ( c. 240 )). A temple of Demeter is mentioned in Pausanias' description of Kopai ( 9 . 24 . 1 ), and a cult of Demeter Tauropolos is attested in an undated inscription found in Kopai ( IG vii 2793 , now lost); the bull on the C4 coins of Kopai ( infra ) indicates that Demeter Tauropolos was worshipped in Kopai already in the Classical period (Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 154 -55 ). A line of an ashlar wall (presumably of C4s) and possibly the position of a tower can still be observed (Fossey ( 1988 ) 278 ). The settlement is supposed to have covered c. 23 ha (Bintliff ( 1997 a ) 244 ); it can be traced back to the Neolithic period,and there are remains of the Geometric,Archaic and Classical periods (Fossey ( 1988 ) 279 ). Kopai struck silver obols on the Aiginetan standard and bronze coins between 386 (or earlier) and 374 (or later). ( 1 ) Silver: obv . Boiotian shield; rev . forepart of bull. Legend: ΚΩΠΑΙΩΝ . ( 2 ) Bronze: obv . Boiotian shield; rev . head of bull. Legend: ΚΩ (Head, HN ² 344 )."
210,Koroneia (Koroneus),Boiotia,38.25,22.55,1231,5900,"210 . Koroneia (Koroneus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 25 , long. 22 . 55 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Κορώνεια , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 503 ; Thuc. 1 . 113 . 2 ; IG ii² 5222 ( 394 ); SEG 19 363 (C4s)), but a C6 dedication in Olympia has /Koppaορόνεια ( LSAG 93 and 95 no. 11 ). The toponym denotes either the town ( IG iv² . 1 94 .a. 7 ) or the polity (Dem. 19 . 325 ) or the territory ( IG ii² 5222 . vii . 1 ( 394 )). In most literary sources the city-ethnic is Κορωναῖος (Hdt. 5 . 79 . 2 ; Thuc. 4 . 93 . 4 ), but in inscriptions and some literary sources it is Κορωνευacuteς (Lazzarini ( 1976 ) 916 ; CID ii 74 . i . 50 ( 337 / 6 ); Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 ); once it is Κορώνιος (Strabo 9 . 2 . 29 ). Again, [ /Koppaο ] ρονε [ ˜ ες ] has been restored on a C6l helmet dedicated to Olympian Zeus ( SEG 42 381 ), and the oldest coins ( 500 -480 ) are marked with a /Koppa , whereas the coins of the next series (from c. 456 -446 ) have the legend ΚΟΡΟ (Head, HN ² 345 ). Koroneia is perhaps called a polis in the urban sense by Hecat. fr. 117 ( = Steph. Byz. 377 . 12 , where Hekataios is quoted for the toponym but not necessarily for the siteclassification). Koroneia is called a polis in the political sense in Thucydides' description of the battle of Delion ( 4 . 91 . 1 , 93 . 4 ) and in the Oxyrhynchus historian's description of the Boiotian constitution ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ) and externally in a C6 dedication in Thebes (Lazzarini ( 1976 ) 916 ) as well as in literary sources (Hdt. 5 . 79 . 2 ; Thuc. 4 . 93 . 4 ). The individual use is attested internally in a list of victors at the Pamboiotia ( SEG 26 551 (C3s)) and externally in a sepulchral inscription from Thespiai: Ευκράτη Κορωνευtilde χαῖρε ( IG vii 2114 = Choix 49 (Heltic)). The territory was called Κορώνεια (Thuc. 1 . 113 . 2 ; Arist. Mir. ausc . 842 b 3 ) or ηasper Κορωνειακή (Strabo 9 . 2 . 19 , 28 ). The territory comprised Hermaion (a valley), Metachoion (a fortress between Koroneia and Orchomenos (no. 213 ), Ephor. fr. 94 a), the sanctuary of Athena Itonia (Strabo 9 . 2 . 29 ; schol. Ap. Rhod. 1 . 551 a) and Alalkomenai (no. 199 ) (Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 113 ). Its size has been assessed at c. 95 km ² (Fossey ( 1988 ) 322 ). Together with Haliartos (no. 206 ) and Lebadeia (no. 211 ), Koroneia constituted one of the eleven Boiotian districts ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 ). The principal body of government was a boule , to which only propertied citizens were admitted ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 2 , 3 ). Koroneia was allied with Thebes in 506 and earlier (Hdt. 5 . 79 . 2 ). The city was a member of the First Federation ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 -4 ), the Second Federation (Diod. 16 . 35 . 3 ) and the Third Federation ( CID ii 74 . 50 ). A citizen of Koroneia was appointed proxenos by Delphi (no. 177 ) ( F.Delphes iii . 3 102 (C4l)). In 359 a theorodokos was appointed to host theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 94 .a. 7 ). The protecting god of Koroneia was Athena Itonia,whose sanctuary seems to have been located just to the north of the acropolis (Alc. fr. 325 ; Bacchyl. fr. 15 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 117 -27 ), where excavations have uncovered the foundations of three buildings that can be traced back to C6 (Fossey ( 1988 ) 326 ). The cult is attested on a C6lekane (Brit. Mus. B 80 ) depicting Athena, her priestess and a serpentine consort, later identified with the chthonic Zeus. Her festival included hippic competitions (Pind. Parth . 2 . 46 -49 ). The pan-Boiotian festival postdates the Classical period. Another important deity at Koroneia was Herakles Charops (Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) ii. 3 -10 ), whose sanctuary was close to and possibly shared with Zeus Laphystios ( SEG 23 297 . 6 -7 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) iii. 104 -6 ). In inscriptions of C4 -C3 is attested a cult of Demeter Thesmophoros ( IG vii 2876 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 155 ). In 353 / 2 Koroneia was conquered by Onomarchos (Ephor. fr. 94 a; Diod. 16 . 35 . 3 ) and became a Phokian stronghold (Dem. 19 . 148 ; Diod. 16 . 58 . 1 ) until 346 , when Philip had the city handed over to the Thebans (Dem. 5 . 22 , 6 . 13 ), who exposed it to an andrapodismos (Dem. 19 . 112 , 325 ); but shortly afterwards Koroneia must have been resettled, since in 337 / 6 one of the Boiotian tamiai in Delphi was a Koroneian citizen ( CID ii 74 . 50 ). Koroneia was a walled city when conquered by the Phokians in 353 (Ephor. fr. 94 a; Diod. 16 . 58 . 1 ). There are remains of an undated polygonal circuit around the acropolis, enclosing an area of 38 ha (Fossey ( 1988 ) 325 -26 , letter of Jan. 1995 ); another circuit of unknown date enclosing the lower town could still be seen in the nineteenth century (Frazer ( 1898 ) v. 70 ). The settlement is supposed to have covered c. 94 ha (Bintliff ( 1997 a ) 244 ); it can be traced back to the Neolithic period, and there are remains of the Geometric, Archaic and Classical periods (Fossey ( 1988 ) 326 ). The site of a possible theatre and above it remains of a Doric temple were noted by early travellers (Fossey ( 1988 ) 325 ). Koroneia struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard c. 500 -480 , c. 456 -446 and in C5l-C4f, and bronze coins c. 338 -315 .

211,Lebadeia (Lebadeus),Boiotia,38.25,22.5,1047,4890,"211 . Lebadeia (Lebadeus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 25 , long. 22 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Λεβάδεια , ηasper (Hdt 8 . 134 . 1 ; IG vii 3083 . 4 -5 (C3s)), denoting either the town ( IG iv² . 1 94 .a. 9 ; Theophr. Hist. pl . 4 . 11 . 8 ) or the territory (Xen. Mem . 3 . 5 . 4 ). According to Paus. 9 . 39 . 1 , the original toponym was Μίδεια , mentioned in the Homeric Catalogue of Ships (Hom. Il . 2 . 507 ). The city-ethnic is Λεβαδευacuteς ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ; CID ii 102 . i . 11 ( 324 / 3 )) or, once, Λεπαδευacuteς ( IG xii . 5 542 . 25 (C4m)), but in some Boiotian inscriptions it is Λεβαδειηtildeος ( IG vii 3068 . 1 = Michel 635 (C3 )). Lebadeia is called a polis in the political sense at Hell. Oxy 19 . 3 and in a sacred law of C4m ( IG vii 3055 ). The formula [ ταtildeς πόλιος ταtildeς ] Λεβαδε [ ι ] α [ ί ] ω [ ν ] is restored in IG vii 3086 of c. 400 , but see Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) iii. 76 n. 1 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a sacred law ( IG vii 3055 (C4s); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) iii. 86 -88 ) and externally in Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 . For the individual and external use, see IG xii . 5 542 . 25 (C4m), a Karthaian proxenos , or CID ii 102 . i . 11 : Σωκράτε [ ος Λ ] εβαδειέο [ ς ], hieromnemon in 324 / 3 . The territory was called Λεβάδεια (Cratinus fr. 220 ; Xen. Mem. 3 . 5 . 4 ; Theophr. Hist. pl . 4 . 11 . 8 ) or ηasper Λεβαδιακή (Arist. Hist. an. 606 a 1 ). Together with Koroneia (no. 210 ) and Haliartos (no. 206 ), Lebadeia constituted one of the eleven Boiotian districts ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ). A horos of C4 -C3found some 4 km south-east of Lebadeia marks the border between Lebadeia and Koroneia ( SEG 23 297 ). T o the northeast Lebadeia bordered on the territory of Orchomenos (no. 213 ) (Arist. Hist. an. 606 a 1 , a passage which shows that Lake Kopais in C4 was considerably smaller than indicated in Barr .; cf. also Lauffer ( 1986 ) 136 ). The adjoining city to the north was Chaironeia (no. 201 ) (Plut. Mor . 849 A (rC4 )). The size of the territory has been assessed at c. 95 km ² (Fossey ( 1988 ) 322 , 342 ). Lebadeia was a member of the First Federation ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ), and the principal body of government was a boule , to which only propertied citizens were admitted ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 2 , 3 ). The city was sacked by Lysandros in 395 (Plut. Lys . 28 . 2 ). The city must have been a member of the Second Federation as well, since the panegyris celebrating the Boiotian victory at Leuktra took place in Lebadeia ( infra ), and the attestation of a hieromnemon in 324 / 3 testifies to membership of the Third Federation ( CID ii 102 . i . 11 ). Theorodokoi were appointed c. 400 to host theoroi from Delphi (no. 177 ) ( Syll . ³ 90 . 14 -15 ), and in 359 to host theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ) (restored in IG iv² . 1 94 .a. 9 ). Lebadeia was famous for its oracle of Trophonios, with his brother Agamedes the mythical architect of Apollo's temple at Delphi ( Hymn.Hom.Ap . 296 ). In his subterranean cave just outside Lebadeia, Trophonios was consulted allegedly by Kroisos of Lydia (Hdt. 1 . 46 . 2 ) and Mys of Persia (Hdt. 8 . 134 . 1 ), and certainly in C4m by King Amyntas of Macedon ( IG vii 3055 . 7 -8 ). The cult is attested from C6 to the end of Antiquity ( IG vii 3055 : a sacred law of C4m regulating the consultations; Eur. Ion 300 -2 , 404 -9 ; Paus. 9 . 39 . 2 -14 ; Schachter ( 1991 -94 ) iii. 66 -89 ). The protecting god of Lebadeia was probably Zeus Basileus and, allegedly following an oracle of Trophonios given before the battle of Leuktra in 371 , a pan-Boiotian festival was set up at Lebadeia in honour of Zeus Basileus (Diod. 15 . 53 . 4 ). The festival was held under Theban sponsorship to celebrate their victory and included gymnic and hippic competitions ( IG vii 552 , 2532 ; SEG 23 332 (all C4m); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) iii. 109 -18 ). The city of Lebadeia was situated on the eastern bank of the river Herkyna (Paus. 9 . 39 . 2 ) beneath the modern city. The size of the city is still unknown (Bintliff ( 1997 a ) 231 ), and so far no traces of an ancient defence circuit have been found.Excavations have revealed some remains of C4monumental buildings including a stoa and a temple of the Megale Meter (Fossey ( 1988 ) 345 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) ii. 127 -30 ; Turner ( 1994 )). T o the west of the river Herkyna were the famous oracle of Trophonios and the sanctuary of Zeus Basileios with a Doric temple, of which there are still some remains, presumably dating from C3 (Fossey ( 1988 ) 345 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) iv. 112 -13 ). Lebadeia struck silver diobols on the Aiginetan standard from c. 386 (or earlier) to 374 (or later) and bronze coins from c. 338 to 315 . ( 1 ) Silver: obv . Boiotian shield; rev . thunderbolt.

212,Mykalessos (Mykalessios),Boiotia,38.25,23.3,577,2737,"212 . Mykalessos (Mykalessios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 25 , long. 23 . 30 . Size of territory: 2 ? Type: A. The toponym is Μυκαλησσός , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 498 ; Thuc. 7 . 29 . 2 -3 ), denoting either the town (Thuc. 7 . 29 . 3 -4 ) or the polity (Thuc. 7 . 30 . 3 ) or the territory (Hom. Il . 2 . 498 ). The city-ethnic is Μυκαλήσσιος (Thuc. 7 . 30 . 3 ). Neither the toponym nor the city-ethnic is attested in epigraphical sources. Mykalessos is called a polis both in the urban and in the political sense by Thuc. 7 . 29 -30 . According to Strabo it was a kome ( 9 . 2 . 11 , 14 ), whereas Paus. 9 . 19 . 4 , retrospectively, describes Mykalessos as the ruins of a polis . The collective form of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ) and externally in Thuc. 7 . 30 . 3 , paraphrased by Pausanias at 1 . 23 . 3 . In the Heltic and Roman periods Mykalessos was located in the territory of Tanagra (no. 220 ) (Strabo 9 . 2 . 11 , 14 ; Paus. 9 . 19 . 8 ), and that seems to have been the case already in C5e (Fossey ( 1988 ) 83 -84 , 222 -23 ; Hansen ( 1995 a ) 36 -37 ). Within the Tanagraian territory, however, Mykalessos had its own territory, called Μυκαλησσός , which seems to have stretched as far as the Euboian Gulf (Paus. 9 . 19 . 5 ; Bakhuizen ( 1970 ) 20 -21 , 148 -49 ), and so its area must be assessed as at least 50 and perhaps more than 100 km ² . In 413 the city was sacked by Thrakian mercenaries, and a large part of the population was killed (Thuc. 7 . 29 -30 ). Mykalessos was walled, but the circuit was not very high, and parts of it had collapsed (Thuc. 7 . 29 . 3 ). The wall reported by Lolling ( 1989 ) 508 may have been the remains of a circuit (Fossey ( 1988 ) 80 -81 ). Thucydides describes Mykalessos as a small polis , and apart from houses the only buildings mentioned are some sanctuaries and a school (Thuc. 7 . 29 . 4 -5 ). At the site are remains of an undated circuit wall in polygonal masonry and considerable architectural fragments. The settlement can be traced back to EH ii and there are remains of the Archaic and Classical periods (Fossey ( 1988 ) 80 -83 ). The large cemetery testifies to a peak of population in C6s (Ure ( 1940 ); Sparkes ( 1967 ) 128 -30 ). Mykalessos struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard from c. 500 to 480 and from 386 (or earlier) to 374 (or later). ( 1 ) c. 500 -480 , denominations: stater, drachm, hemiobol; obv .

213,Orchomenos (Orchomenios),Boiotia,38.3,23.0,2074,10019,"213 . Orchomenos (Orchomenios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 30 , long. 23 . 00 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: A. The toponym is ' Ορχο µ ενός , οasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 511 ; Thuc. 3 . 87 . 4 ) or, in the Boiotian dialect, ' Ερχο µ ενός ( LSAG 93 and 95 no. 17 ( c. 475 -450 ?)). The toponym denotes either the town ( IG iv² . 1 94 .a. 8 ) or the polity (Dem. 19 . 325 ) or the territory (Thuc. 1 . 113 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ορχο µ ένιος (Hdt. 9 . 16 . 1 ; CID ii 74 . i . 36 ), but in Boiotian inscriptions almost always ' Ερχο µ ένιος ( LSAG 93 and 95 no. 11 (C6m)) and only occasionally ' Ορχο µ ένιος (both forms are attested in IG vii 3172 . 17 , 51 -52 ( 223 )). Orchomenos is called a polis in the urban sense (Dem. 16 . 25 and implicitly in Ps.-Skylax 59 ), in the political sense (Thuc. 4 . 91 . 1 , 93 . 4 ; Hell . Oxy . 19 . 2 -3 ) and in the territorial sense (Pind. fr. 333 .a. 8 , Maehler). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in an abbreviated form on coins ( infra ) and externally on a C6m helmet at Olympia commemorating a victory over Koroneia (no. 210 ) ( LSAG 93 and 95 no. 11 ). For the individual and external use, see Νικίας ' Ερ µ αίου ' Ερχο µ ένιος ( IG ii² 10036 ( 410 -390 )). See also in the C5 dedication from Delphi: [ ' Ε ] πίδδαλος . . . Βοιότιος εχς ' Ερχ [ ο µ εν ˜ ο ] ( LSAG 93 and 95 no. 17 ( c. 475 -450 )). The territory was called γηtilde ηasper ' Ορχο µ ενίων (Hdt. 8 . 34 ) or ηasper Ορχο µ ενία (Theophr. Hist. pl . 9 . 13 . 1 ; Strabo 9 . 2 . 19 ) or ηasper ' Ορχο µ ενός (Thuc. 1 . 113 . 2 ). (When denoting the city, the gender of the toponym is invariably masculine-the exception is Apol. Rhod. Arg . 4 . 257 -thus ηasper ' Ορχο µ ενός probably denotes the territory of Orchomenos with either γηtilde or χώρα implied.) To the north, Orchomenos bordered on Phokis and included Aspledon (Paus. 9 . 38 . 9 ), Kyrtone and Korseia (Paus. 9 . 39 . 1 ; cf. Etienne and Knoepfler ( 1976 ) 196 ) and Tegyra (Plut. Pelop . 16 . 1 -3 ). T o the south Orchomenos bordered on the territory of Lebadeia (no. 211 ) (Arist. Hist. an. 605 b 31 ; Paus. 9 . 39 . 1 ). Down to c. 400 the territory of Orchomenos seems to have included Chaironeia (no. 201 ) (Hdt. 8 . 34 . 1 ; Thuc. 4 . 76 . 3 ; Theopomp. fr. 407 ), and after 457 Chaironeia and Orchomenos served as a refuge for oligarchs from the other Boiotian poleis (Hellan. fr. 81 ). But Chaironeia became free of Orchomenos at some time after 424 (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 3 , 93 . 4 ) but before 395 ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ). The size of the territory has been assessed at c. 105 km ² (Fossey ( 1988 ) 342 ); including Kyrtone and Korseia it was c. 150 km. Together with Hyettos (no. 207 ), Orchomenos constituted two of the eleven Boiotian districts ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ). In the Catalogue of Ships Orchomenos is called Μινυacuteειος and is not a part of Boiotia (Hom. Il . 2 . 511 ; cf. Thuc. 4 . 76 . 3 ). According to this tradition, Orchomenos and the Minyans had once ruled Boiotia and received tribute from the Boiotian cities (Isoc. 14 . 10 ; Diod. 15 . 79 . 5 ). On the Bronze Age palace and Mycenaean remains in Orchomenos, see Hiller ( 1989 ). Orchomenos was a member of the First Federation, and, together with Hyettos,supplied two of the eleven Boiotarchs ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 ); but in 395 at the outbreak of the Corinthian War the Orchomenians joined Sparta and defected from the Federation (Xen. Hell . 3 . 5 . 6 ). The city was garrisoned by the Spartans from 395 to 375 or even later (Xen. Hell . 4 . 3 . 15 , 5 . 1 . 29 ; Diod. 15 . 37 . 1 ), and the war between Thebes and Orchomenos went on until 371 (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 10 ). In 370 , however, Orchomenos was forced to rejoin the Boiotian Federation (Diod. 15 . 57 . 1 ), apparently without any representation in the federal government (only seven Boiotarchs in 365 : SEG 34 355 ). An abortive coup d'état planned by the Orchomenian knights in collusion with some Theban exiles resulted in a Theban attack on Orchomenos in 364 . The city was conquered,destroyed and exposed to an andrapodismos by which all men were killed while women and children were sold into slavery (Diod. 15 . 79 . 3 -6 ; Dem. 16 . 4 , 16 . 25 , 20 . 109 ). But the site was not abandoned: and in 359 an Orchomenian theorodokos was appointed to host a theoros from Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 94 .a. 8 ). So in 364 Orchomenos must have been given to settlers who were loyal to Thebes. In 354 Orchomenos was conquered by Onomarchos (Diod. 16 . 33 . 4 ; Buckler ( 1989 ) 56 ) and occupied by the Phokians until their capitulation in the summer of 346 (Dem. 19 . 148 ; Aeschin. 2 . 141 ; Diod. 16 . 58 . 1 ). During the Phokian occupation the city was resettled by some Orchomenians, probably those who had escaped the andrapodismos of 364 (Aeschin. 2 . 141 ; Dem. 16 . 25 ; schol. Dem. 6 . 13 , 21 , Dilts). After the peace with the Phokians, Philip surrendered Orchomenos to the Thebans (Dem. 5 . 21 -22 ), and the city seems to have suffered yet another andrapodismos (Dem. 19 . 112 , 141 , 325 ). When the Thebans had been defeated at Chaironeia,however,Orchomenos was refounded, this time with Philip's support, and the city was given back to the surviving Orchomenians (Paus. 4 . 27 . 10 , 9 . 37 . 8 ); it joined the Federation again,and in 337 / 6 one of the Boiotian hieromnemones at Delphi was an Orchomenian ( CID ii 74 . i . 36 , ii . 27 ). After the destruction of Thebes in 335 , Orchomenos became once again a walled city (Arr. Anab . 1 . 9 . 10 ). Orchomenos was a member of the Kalaurian Amphiktyony (Strabo 8 . 6 . 14 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) ii. 213 -14 ; Tausend ( 1992 ) 12 -13 ). In 452 Orchomenos may have been a member of the Delian League ( IG i³ 260 . ix . 9 , as restored by D. Lewis; see CAH v. 50 ). The constitution of Orchomenos was oligarchic (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 3 ; Diod. 15 . 79 . 3 ), and we hear about some Orchomenian exiles who in 424 planned to set up democracies in Siphai (no. 218 ) and Chaironeia (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 3 ; cf. Hansen ( 1995 a ) 22 ). The principal body of government was a boule , to which only propertied citizens were admitted ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 2 , 3 ). The Aristotelian collection of politeiai included a Constitution of the Orchomenians (Arist. frr. 578 -82 ). Pausanias'reference at 9 . 34 . 10 to two Orchomenian phylai , if trustworthy,must refer to his own day (Jones, POAG 78 -79 ). Orchomenian citizens were appointed proxenoi by Delphi (no. 177 ) ( F.Delphes iii . 4 394 (C4s, but heavily restored)). The protecting god of Orchomenos was Zeus with various epithets, of which Karaios ( SEG 32 478 (C4f)) and Soter (Tod 197 ( 330 / 29 )) are attested in Classical sources (Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) iii. 120 -24 ). Other major divinities attested in the Archaic and Classical periods are (a) the Charites (Pind. Ol . 14 . 3 -4 ; Ephor. fr. 152 ), whose sanctuary according to Paus. 9 . 38 . 1 was the oldest in Orchomenos (Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 140 -41 ); (b) Dionysos,whose sanctuary housed a cult image by Myron (Paus. 9 . 30 . 1 (rC5m)); musical contests are attested c. 400 (Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 180 n. 2 ), and a biennial rite in which the priest of Dionysos pursued women in ritual flight (and if he caught one might kill her) must antedate the Classical period (Plut. Mor . 299 F; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 179 -81 ). An extra-urban sanctuary of the Classical period c. 3 . 5 km north of Orchomenos has been assigned to Dionysos (Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 181 ). Asopichos of Orchomenos is recorded as victor in the Olympic Games of 488 (Pind. Ol . 14 ; Olympionikai 182 ). The only explicit reference in written sources to walls is ωχυρω µ ένος at Diod. 16 . 58 . 1 , which shows that Orchomenos was fortified during the Phokian occupation, 353 -346 . Substantial remains of a polygonal and irregular trapezoidal wall enclose the acropolis and the western part of the town; it is crowned by a keep of ashlar masonry. The existing walls enclose an area of less than 40 ha,but the lower city must have extended further to the south, and the settlement may have covered altogether c. 90 ha (Bintliff ( 1997 a ) 243 ). The date of the wall is disputed. Fossey ( 1988 ) 353 suggests the Archaic period for the polygonal masonry and the Classical for the ashlar; Scranton ( 1941 ) prefers C4m,whereas Lauffer ( 1974 ) 297 -99 prefers to identify the remains with the walls erected in the 330 s after the sack of Thebes in 335 (Arr. Anab . 1 . 9 . 10 ). For the Archaic and Classical periods the degree of urbanisation is virtually unknown, partly because the Classical remains were destroyed by the later Byzantine occupation and partly because the relevant material from Bulle's excavations was never published (Lauffer ( 1974 ) 311 ). Remains have been found of Archaic temples, one of them possibly the shrine of the Charites or of Dionysos (Fossey ( 1988 ) 354 ), and a theatre of C4s (Spyropoulos in AR 20 ( 1973 -74 ) 20 ), apparently dedicated to the Charites ( BCH 98 ( 1974 ) 224 ; Isler ( 1994 ) 268 ). The settlement can be traced back to the Neolithic period, and there are remains of the Geometric, Archaic and Classical periods (Fossey ( 1988 ) 353 -59 ). Orchomenos struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard from c. 500 to 480 and from c. 400 (or earlier, supra 432 ) to 374 (or later), and bronze coins c. 338 -315 .

214,Oropos (Oropios),Boiotia,38.2,23.45,1301,6321,"214 . Oropos (Oropios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 20 , long. 23 . 45 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: B. The toponym is ' Ωρωπός , οasper (Hdt. 6 . 101 . 1 ; Dem. 16 . 11 ; SEG 19 363 (C4s); SEG 3 117 . 14 ( 303 / 2 )), or, once, ηasper (Steph. Byz. 601 . 3 ) denoting either the town (Thuc. 8 . 60 . 1 ) or the territory (Hyp. 3 . 16 ). The cityethnic is ' Ωρώπιος (Thuc. 2 . 23 . 3 ; I.Oropos 1 -2 = IG vii 4250 -51 = RO 75 A-B ( 338 -335 ); cf. Rhodes, DGS 116 ). All attestations of Oropos as a polis are Heltic. Oropos is called a polis in the urban sense by Heracl. Cret. 7 ( GGM i . 100 (C3s)) and in the political sense by Diod. 14 . 17 . 3 (rC4 ), and in some citizenship decrees of 322 -312 ( I.Oropos 4 . 7 -8 , 5 . 8 -9 , 6 . 9 -10 = IG vii 4256 -57 and SEG 15 . 264 (all C4l)). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in two proxeny decrees of C4m ( I.Oropos 1 -2 ) and externally in many literary sources (Thuc. 2 . 23 . 3 ; Isoc. 14 . 20 ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a sepulchral inscription of C2 ( SEG 15 303 ) and externally in an Attic naval catalogue of C5l ( IG i³ 1032 . 170 ) and in a list of aphedriateuontes of 312 -304 : [ Κ ] ρατυacuteλλω Α µ φιδα µ ίω ' Ωρωπίω ( IG vii 2724 a. 5 ( c. 280 -270 )). The name of the territory is ' Ωρωπία (Thuc. 4 . 99 . 1 ) or ' Ωρωπός (Hyp. 3 . 16 ), οasper (Steph. Byz. 711 . 2 ) or ηasper (Steph. Byz. 601 . 3 ). It is sometimes referred to as being contiguous with Boiotia ( SEG 37 100 . 142 ( c. 330 )) and sometimes as being part of Boiotia (Paus. 1 . 34 . 1 ). Thucydides' account of the aftermath of the battle of Delion shows that Oropos was a border district between Attika and Boiotia (Thuc. 4 . 99 . 1 ). The size of the territory has been assessed at c. 110 km ² (Fossey ( 1988 ) 28 ). A survey has been conducted in the territory (Cosmopoulos ( 2001 )). According to the Boiotian historian Nikokrates ( FGrHist 376 ) fr. 1 , Oropos was originally a colony of Eretria (no. 370 ), and this piece of information is supported by a study of the local dialect, which was neither Boiotian nor Attic but a form of Ionic very close to that spoken by the Eretrians (Wilamowitz-Möllendorff ( 1886 ) 97 -103 ). Oropos fell to Athens probably after 507 / 6 (since the settlement did not become an Attic deme), perhaps before 490 (Hdt. 6 . 101 . 1 ), but perhaps only after the Persian destruction of Eretria (Knoepfler ( 1985 ) 52 ). During most of C5 Oropos was an Athenian dependency (Thuc. 2 . 23 . 3 ), but in 412 / 11 the city was conquered by the Boiotians, assisted by some Oropians (Thuc. 8 . 60 . 1 ; Gehrke, Stasis 125 ), and enjoyed a short period of independence (Lys. 31 . 9 ) until 402 , when the losing side in a civil war appealed to Thebes. The Thebans captured the city and forced its population to leave their settlement on the coast and move 7 stades inland. The Oropians were first allowed to retain their political institutions, probably as a Theban dependency, but after a few years Oropos was annexed to the Boiotian Federation and all Oropians were made citizens of Thebes (Diod. 14 . 17 . 1 -3 ; Theopomp. fr. 12 ). When the Boiotian federation was dissolved in 386 after the King's Peace, Oropos must have regained its independence, but some time between 375 and 373 the Oropians preferred to join Athens once again rather than be forced by Thebes to join the new Boiotian Federation (Isoc. 14 . 20 , 37 ; Knoepfler ( 1986 b ) 90 -93 ; SEG 36 442 ). Already in 366 (Diod. 15 . 76 . 1 ), however, Oropos was captured by the Eretrian tyrants (Aeschin. 3 . 85 ; Dem. 18 . 99 ). Faced with the threat of a major Athenian attack, they agreed to hand over Oropos to the Thebans and submit to international arbitration. The Thebans garrisoned the city, but the arbitration came to nothing,and Thebes annexed Oropos once again (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 1 ; Diod. 15 . 76 . 1 ; schol. Dem. 18 . 99 , 176 , Dilts; 21 . 64 , 204 , Dilts). Two proxeny decrees passed by the Oropians in their ekklesia (RO 75 A-B) in probably 359 / 8 (Coulton ( 1968 ) 182 ) strongly suggest that Oropos,though depending on Thebes, was still a polis , and not just a municipality (Hansen ( 1995 a ) 39 ). After the defeat at Chaironeia, Oropos was transferred to Athens, perhaps already by Philip in 338 (Paus. 1 . 34 . 1 ; schol. Dem. 18 . 99 , 176 , Dilts; Robert ( 1960 ) 195 ), perhaps only in 335 after Alexander's destruction of Thebes (Knoepfler ( 1993 ) 295 ). During this period Oropos was ruled by a demarchos ( IG ii² 1672 . 272 -3 ). Oropos regained its independence in 322 , had it confirmed in 319 (Diod. 18 . 56 . 6 ), but became a member of the Third Boiotian Federation in the years 312 -304 (Diod. 19 . 78 . 3 ; IG vii 2724 a. 5 ( c. 280 -270 )). In C4s Oropos awarded proxenia to a member of the Makedonian royal family and to a Makedonian nobleman ( I.Oropos 1 -2 ). Remains of an undated fortification wall enclosing the acropolis are still visible along the west side, but only as a fall in the land with some debris.All remains of ancient structures have disappeared (Fossey ( 1988 ) 30 and letter of Jan. 1995 ). Oropos was famous for its sanctuary of Amphiaraos situated east of the city. The Amphiareion was originally an underground oracle,allegedly consulted by Kroisos of Lydia (Hdt. 1 . 46 . 2 ) and by Mys of Persia (Hdt. 8 . 134 ), in C4s by Euxenippos on behalf of the Athenian polis (Hyp. 3 . 14 -17 ). It was rebuilt and reorganised in C5s as a predominantly iatromantic sanctuary (Ar. fr. 21 , PCG ) administered by a hiereus and a neokoros ( I.Oropos 276 -77 (C4f); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 19 -26 ; Petrakos ( 1968 ) 61 -129 ). The visible remains are mostly of C5l-C4s, and include a temple, an altar, separate baths for men and women, a small theatre, a Doric stoa and a larger theatre behind the stoa ( I.Oropos 290 -93 (C4s); Petrakos ( 1974 ) 26 -57 ; Travlos ( 1988 ) 301 -18 ). In 329 / 8 the Athenians instituted the Great Amphiaraia as a Panhellenic quadrennial festival with competitions in athletics and music ( I.Oropos 298 ). A contemporary list of victors records participants from, e.g. Sinope (no. 729 ), Kolophon (no. 848 ), Argos (no. 347 ) and Thebes (no. 221 ) in addition to numerous Athenians (no. 361 ) ( IG vii 414 = I.Oropos 520 ; cf. Knoepfler ( 1993 ))."

The identification of Pharai with modern Ag. Pandeleimon is uncertain (Fossey ( 1988 ) 96 ; Barr .). Pharai is not called a polis in any extant source, but the existence of a C4mint strongly suggests that it must have been a polis , at least in the period after the King's Peace of 386 . According to Strabo ( 9 . 2 . 14 -15 ), Pharai, Heleon, Harma and Mykalessos (no. 212 ) formed a τετρακω µ ία which lay in the territory of Tanagra (no. 220 ). All sherds and tombs found in the area date from the Archaic and Classical periods (Fossey ( 1988 ) 97 ). Pharai struck silver obols on the Aiginetan standard between c. 386 (or earlier) and 374 (or later): obv . Boiotian shield; rev . amphora. Legend: ΦΑ (Head, HN ² 347 ; SNG Cop. Boeotia 211 ).

The toponym is Πλαταιαί , αιasper (RO 88 . 34 -35 (C4m); IG iv² . 1 629 (C2 ); Hdt. 9 . 25 . 2 ), but some authors use the singular: Πλάταια , ηasper (Hom. Il 2 . 504 ; Thuc. 2 . 2 . 1 et alibi ). The toponym denotes either the town (Thuc. 2 . 2 . 1 ) or the polity (Thuc. 2 . 2 . 3 ) or the territory (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 48 ). The city-ethnic is Πλαταιευacuteς (ML 27 . 6 ( 479 ); SEG 9 2 . 44 (C4s); IG vii 1664 . 2 -3 (C3 ); Hdt. 8 . 44 . 1 ; Thuc. 2 . 3 . 1 ; Lys. 23 . 2 ), and the ktetikon Πλαταικός is used as an ethnic only in the feminine ( IG ii² 10096 (C4m)); for one possible exception, see Aeschin. 3 . 162 . Plataiai is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 8 . 50 . 2 ; Thuc. 2 . 5 . 4 , 3 . 68 . 3 ; Aen. Tact. 2 . 3 ) and in the political sense (Thuc. 2 . 2 . 2 , 3 . 57 . 2 ; Isoc. 8 . 17 , 14 . 1 ; Dem. 16 . 25 , 59 . 98 ); cf. polites at Thuc. 2 . 2 . 2 , 3 . 65 . 3 . At RO 88 . 34 (C4 ), polis is used in the urban and political senses simultaneously. The term άστυ is used by Hdt. 7 . 233 . 2 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins of C4e ( infra ; cf. also IG vii 1664 . 2 -3 (C3 )) and externally on the Serpent Column (ML 27 . 6 ( 479 )). For the individual and external use, see, e.g. ' Εχίλαος Φιλωνίδου Πλαταιευacuteς in a Troizenian citizenship decree of 369 ( Syll . ³ 162 . 2 -3 ( 369 )). Patris is used about the community at Isoc. 14 . 13 . The name of the territory is γηtilde Πλαταιίς (Thuc. 2 . 71 . 4 ); χώρα Πλαταιίς (Thuc. 3 . 58 . 5 ); Πλαταιαtildeσιν (Thuc. 4 . 72 . 1 ); εν ταῖς Πλαταιαῖς (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 48 ). In 506 the river Asopos was made the border between Plataiai and Thebes (Hdt. 6 . 108 . 6 ; Paus. 9 . 4 . 4 ). T o the west Plataiai bordered on Thespiai (no. 222 ) (Hdt 8 . 50 . 2 ) and to the east on Hysiai (no. 208 ) (Hdt. 6 . 108 . 6 ), which was then a part of Attika (Hdt. 5 . 74 . 2 ). The size of the territory has been assessed at c. 170 km ² (Fossey ( 1988 ) 100 ). It is debated whether Plataiai too was a part of Attika from 519 onwards (for: Badian ( 1993 ) 117 ; against: Hammond ( 1992 ) 145 ). But at least from 479 Plataiai was a part of Boiotia. Plataiïs came to constitute two of the eleven Boiotian districts and included the small towns in the Parasopia which by then had entered into a sympoliteia with Plataiai; viz . Skolos (no. 219 ), Erythrai (no. 203 ), Eteonos/Skaphai (no. 204 ) and, undoubtedly, Hysiai ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ). In 429 King Archidamos summoned the Plataians to show him the borders of Plataian territory (Thuc. 2 . 72 . 3 ). In 427 / 6 the territory was annexed by Thebes (Thuc. 3 . 68 . 2 -3 , 5 . 17 . 2 ). Plataiai is described as a small town (Thuc. 2 . 77 . 2 ), and according to Poseidippos (fr. 29 , C3e) it deserved to be called a polis only during the celebration of the Eleutheria ( infra ). Six hundred Plataian hoplites fought at Plataiai in 479 (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 6 ). When the Thebans made their nocturnal attack on Plataiai in 431 , the urban population must have totalled at least some 2 , 000 persons (Thuc. 2 . 3 . 2 ; Hansen ( 1997 ) 27 -28 ), and there were 400 to defend the city when the siege began in 429 (Thuc. 2 . 78 . 3 ). In 519 (Thuc. 3 . 68 . 5 ; Hornblower ( 1991 ) 464 -65 ) Plataiai entered into an alliance with Athens (Thuc. 2 . 73 . 3 , 3 . 68 . 5 ; Hammond ( 1992 ) 144 ) whereby the Plataians were granted Athenian citizenship collectively (Thuc. 3 . 55 . 3 , 63 . 2 ; Amit ( 1973 ) 75 -78 ; Hornblower ( 1991 ) 449 ); the grant probably implied that a Plataian who moved to Athens was inscribed as a citizen without an individual decree passed by the people. The Plataians fought side by side with the Athenians at Marathon (Hdt. 6 . 108 . 1 ), and those who died in battle were buried with the Athenian (manumitted) slaves (Paus. 1 . 32 . 3 ; Hammond ( 1992 ) 147 -50 ). In 480 the Persians occupied Plataiai, and destroyed the city by fire (Hdt. 8 . 50 . 2 ). Plataians fought in the battle of Plataiai in 479 (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 6 ), and after the battle Pausanias had all the victors take an oath that guaranteed the independence of the Plataian polis (Thuc. 2 . 71 . 2 ). At some time between the Persian and the Peloponnesian Wars, when the First Federation was organised as described by the Oxyrhynchus historian, Plataiai had some kind of sympoliteia with the small towns in the Parasopia, controlled two of the eleven districts of Boiotia, and provided two Boiotarchs ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ; Kirsten ( 1950 ) 2302 -3 ). It is apparent, however, from Thucydides' account (Thuc. 2 . 2 . 4 , 3 . 65 . 2 ; Buck ( 1979 ) 153 -54 ) that Plataiai had left the Federation when in the spring of 431 the city was attacked by the Thebans (Thuc. 2 . 2 -6 ), assisted by some Plataian collaborators (Thuc. 2 . 2 . 2 -3 ) of oligarchic convictions (Thuc. 3 . 65 . 2 ; Gehrke, Stasis 132 ). During this period Plataiai was a democracy in which major decisions were made by the people in assembly (Thuc. 2 . 72 . 2 ; see Amit ( 1973 ) 66 -71 ). In the years 429 -427 Plataiai was besieged by the Lakedaimonians and the members of the Peloponnesian League (Thuc. 2 . 71 -78 , 3 . 20 -24 , 3 . 52 -68 ). After its capture in 427 , the men were killed, while the women were exposed to andrapodismos (Thuc. 3 . 68 . 2 ; Dem. 59 . 103 ). In 426 the city was razed to the ground (Thuc. 3 . 68 . 3 ) and settled by some Megarians plus a few Plataians who were loyal to Sparta (Thuc. 3 . 68 . 3 ). Some Plataian evacuees of 431 (Thuc. 2 . 6 . 4 ) and some who in 428 escaped the siege (Thuc. 3 . 24 . 2 ) were all granted Athenian citizenship (Dem. 59 . 103 -4 ; Isoc. 12 . 94 ; Osborne ( 1982 ) D 1 ) and inscribed in the Attic tribes and demes (Lys. 23 . 2 -3 ). After the destruction of Skione (no. 609 ) in 421 , the Athenians gave the place to the Plataians (Thuc. 5 . 32 . 1 ), but many remained in Athens (Lys. 23 . 5 -7 ). The Plataians were restored to their native city only after the King's Peace of 386 (Paus 9 . 1 . 4 ), and perhaps in connection with Sparta's occupation of the Kadmeia in 382 (Isoc. 14 , hypoth.). They remained loyal to the Lakedaimonians after the liberation of Thebes in 379 (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 14 ), and when the Thebans put pressure on the Plataians to join the Second Federation,they refused (Isoc. 14 . 8 -9 ). As a result, Plataiai was conquered and destroyed once again by the Thebans (Xen. Hell . 6 . 3 . 1 , 3 . 5 ; Isoc. 14 . 1 , 5 , 7 , 19 , 35 , 46 ), probably in 373 (Paus. 9 . 1 . 5 -8 ; Tuplin ( 1986 ) 321 n. 2 ) rather than in 374 (Diod. 15 . 46 . 6 ). This time the Plataians were allowed to go into exile (Paus. 9 . 1 . 7 ). They found refuge in Athens once again, and had their previous grant of citizenship renewed (Diod. 15 . 46 . 6 ; cf. Isoc. 14 . 51 -52 ). The town was still deserted and unfortified in 343 (Dem. 19 . 21 , 112 , 325 ), but the Plataians were repatriated by Philip II (Paus. 4 . 27 . 10 , 9 . 1 . 8 ), undoubtedly in consequence of the peace of 338 . They took an active part in the destruction of Thebes in 335 (Arr. Anab. 1 . 8 . 8 ; Diod. 17 . 13 . 5 ), whereupon the members of the Corinthian League decided to rebuild and refortify Plataiai (Arr. Anab . 1 . 9 . 10 ).Yet it may have taken another four years before the town and its walls were re-erected in 331 (Plut. Alex . 34 . 2 , Arist . 11 . 9 ). Plataiai provided one of the naopoioi of 336 / 5 and must accordingly have joined the Boiotian Federation already before the destruction of Thebes ( CID ii 32 . 32 ). Plataiai is attested in 331 as providing one of the hieromnemones ( CID ii 86 . 13 ) and in C3e as providing one of the aphedriateuontes ; it must accordingly have been a member of the Third Federation ( IG vii 2724 . 5 -6 ( c. 280 -270 )). Plataian citizens were appointed proxenoi by Aigina (no. 358 ) (Hdt. 9 . 85 . 3 ), Lakedaimon (no. 345 ) (Thuc. 3 . 52 . 5 ), and Chios (no. 840 ) ( PEP Chios 50 (C4m)). The protecting god of Plataiai was Hera (Plut. Arist . 18 . 1 (r 479 )), whose sanctuary before the destruction of Plataiai in 427 was outside the city (Hdt. 9 . 52 . 1 ), whereas the temple for Hera built by the Thebans in 427 / 6 was probably inside the walls alongside a new katagogeion measuring 200 × 200 feet (Thuc. 3 . 68 . 3 ). The goddess was worshipped by the Plataians at a festival called the 'Little' Daidala. At irregular intervals were held the Greater Daidala, in which several Boiotian poleis participated-in the end perhaps all Boiotian poleis . The key features were a procession carrying a log dressed like a woman and a sacrifice in which the animals were burned up completely, together with the wooden altar on which they were placed (Paus. 9 . 2 . 7 -3 . 9 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 242 -50 ). The hostel built by the Thebans indicates that the Daidala were an interpolis festival already in C5s, and C6 terracotta figurines have been interpreted as evidence of the festival in the Archaic period (Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 244 ). What we know about the festival, however, belongs in the Heltic period (Knoepfler ( 2001 a )). After the victory in 479 Pausanias made a sacrifice to Zeus Eleutherios in the agora of Plataiai (Thuc. 2 . 71 . 2 -4 ), and thereafter the Plataians carried out annual rituals in honour of the fallen (Thuc. 3 . 58 . 4 ; Isoc. 14 . 61 ); but a regular cult of Zeus Eleutherios and the associated festival of Eleutheria were not instituted until C3 (Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) iii. 124 -43 ). The most famous temple in Plataiai was that of Athena Araia,with a cult image by Pheidias and paintings by Polygnotos and Onasias (Paus. 9 . 4 . 1 -2 ; Plut. Arist 20 . 3 ). Plataiai was a fortified city when attacked by Thebes in 431 (Thuc. 2 . 4 . 4 , 75 . 4 ), but in 426 the walls were demolished (Thuc. 3 . 68 . 3 ), and were not re-erected until after the King's Peace of 386 , now with Spartan help (Paus. 9 . 1 . 6 ). This circuit, however, was destroyed once again by the Thebans in 373 (Isoc. 14 . 19 , 35 ; Dem. 6 . 30 ), and new walls were built only after the sack of Thebes in 335 (Arr. Anab . 1 . 9 . 10 ). Remains of all three phases are still to be seen: ( 1 ) Plataiai had no proper acropolis, but the oldest part of the settlement to the northwest, an area of 10 ha, was enclosed by a wall in Lesbian masonry-probably the one that was demolished in 426 . ( 2 ) A new and much larger wall in polygonal masonry with interval towers enclosed an area of 80 ha. ( 3 ) Refounded in 335 , the city was protected by a wall of coursed ashlar blocks enclosing an area of 70 ha (Fossey ( 1988 ) 102 -7 ). The settlement can be traced back to the Neolithic period and there are remains of the Geometric,Archaic and Classical periods (Fossey ( 1988 ) 109 ). Traces of a (still undated) orthogonal town plan have been found in recent excavations ( AR ( 1999 -2000 ) 57 ). Plataiai struck coins on the Aiginetan standard from c. 386 (or earlier) to 374 (or later). Denominations: hemidrachm, diobol,obol; obv . Boiotian shield; rev . head of Hera. Legend: ΠΛΑ (Head, HN ² 347 ; SNG Cop. Boeotia 212 -14 )."
217,Potniai (Potnieus),Boiotia,38.2,23.2,353,1710,"217 . Potniai (Potnieus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 20 , long. 23 . 20 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. The toponym is Ποτνιαί , αιasper ( Hell.Oxy. 20 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 51 ). The city-ethnic is Ποτνιευacuteς ( ArchDelt 3 ( 1917 ) 64 (C6 )). Potniai is called a polis in late sources only (Strabo 9 . 2 . 24 ; schol. Eur. Or . 317 -18 ; Steph. Byz. 533 . 21 ), and Paus. 9 . 8 . 1 has just ερείπια . The reason for including Potniai in this inventory of poleis is the C6 attestation of a city-ethnic inscribed on a poros column drum dedicated to Apollo: [ Απόλ ] λονι Ποτνι ˜ ες ( ArchDelt 3 ( 1917 ) 64 ; cf. Hansen ( 1995 a ) 32 , 48 ). The only other attestation of the ethnic is as an epithet to Glaukos, the heroic founder of Anthedon: Γλαυtildeκος Ποτνιευacuteς (Aesch. frr. 450 -53 , Mette; cf. Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 228 ). Wehave no information about the name of the territory. Potniai was one of the small unwalled settlements whose population was moved to Thebes ( Hell. Oxy . 20 . 3 ) in connection with the major synoecism at the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War (Demand ( 1990 ) 83 -85 ; Moggi, Sin . 197 -204 prefers a date c. 426 -424 ). The absence of physical remains of the Heltic period (Fossey ( 1988 ) 209 ) may indicate that, unlike the other small towns synoecised with Thebes in 431 , Potniai was not resettled. Potniai was famous for its sanctuary of Demeter and Kore (Paus. 9 . 8 . 1 ), which was an ancient one (Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 159 -60 ). The settlement can be traced back to the Protogeometric period (Fossey ( 1988 ) 209 ), but po-ti-ni-ja on a Theban Linear B tablet suggests that Potniai was inhabited in the Mycenaean period too (Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 159 )."
218,Siphai (Siphaieus),Boiotia,38.1,23.05,570,2828,"218 . Siphai (Siphaieus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 10 , long. 23 . 05 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: A. The toponym is Σῖφαι , αιasper (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 2 ), but the singular form is also attested (Steph. Byz. 573 . 1 ), and according to Paus. 9 . 32 . 4 the toponym was Τίφα . The toponym denotes either the town (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 3 ) or the territory (Arist. Part . an . 696 a 5 ). The only preserved attestation of the city-ethnic is Σιφειευacuteς ( IG vii 207 = Michel 170 (C3s)). Siphai is called a polis in the political sense by Thuc. 4 . 76 . 2 -3 , 89 . 2 (cf. Hansen ( 1995 a ) 21 -23 ), and in the urban sense implicitly at Ps.-Skylax 38 , where Σίφαι καιgrave λι µ ήν is a convincing emendation of MSS Σφάσις καιgrave λι µ ήν . In Ps.-Skylax καιgrave λι µ ήν , an ellipsis of πόλις καιgrave λι µ ήν (Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 , 145 ), invariably goes with the preceding and not the following toponym ( pace Müller in GGM ). The territory is called Σῖφαι (Arist. Part. an . 696 a 5 ; Schwandner ( 1977 ) 519 -20 ). It constituted the coastal region of the territory of Thespiai (no. 222 ) (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 3 ), and its size has been assessed at c. 25 km ² (Fossey ( 1988 ) 134 ). Steph. Byz. 573 . 1 calls Siphai an επίνειον τηtildeς Θεσπιακηtildeς . A C4f inventory of Thespian hestiatorion equipment includes some in Siphai ( SEG 24 361 . 25 ), which supports the assumption that Siphai was a dependent polis in Thespian territory. From the abortive attempt in 424 to introduce a democracy, we can infer that Siphai must have had an oligarchic constitution. The democratic faction was supported by Athens, but the stasis was quelled by armed assistance from the other Boiotians (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 2 -3 , 89 . 2 , 101 . 3 ; Hansen ( 1995 a ) 21 -24 ). Siphai was walled in 424 ( προδώσειν : Thuc. 4 . 76 . 3 ). The existing circuit in ashlar masonry with square towers (of which seven are preserved) encloses both the acropolis and the settlement below to the north, east and south. A wall to the south separated the acropolis from the lower city. To the west was the Corinthian Gulf, and no traces of a wall have been found here. The wall is of C4 and, partly for historical reasons, Schwandner suggests a date between 363 and 330 , but the nearby tower at Mavrovouni (Ano-Siphai) from c. 400 points to earlier fortifications at Siphai as well (Schwandner ( 1977 ) 548 -51 ). The circuit encloses an area of c. 3 ha,of which only a part was used for settlement. The harbour was presumably to the south of the city.The settlement can be traced back to EH i -ii , and there are remains of the Geometric, Archaic and Classical periods (Fossey ( 1988 ) 171 ). Siphai had no mint, but stray finds on the acropolis of Thespian coins (Schwandner ( 1977 ) 547 n. 32 ) may suggest that such coins were legal tender in Siphai."
219,Skolos,Boiotia,38.2,23.25,440,2069,"219 . Skolos Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 20 / 38 . 15 , long. 23 . 25 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. Down to c. 404 probably north of the river Asopos, after 404 south of the river, see infra . The toponym is Σκῶλος , οasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 497 ; Eust. Il . 1 . 404 . 24 , van der Valk), denoting either the town (Xen. Ages . 2 . 22 ) or the polity ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 ). The toponym may have been derived from σκόλοπες 'palisade' (letter from Schachter). Apart from Steph. Byz. 580 . 8 , there is no attestation of an ethnic. The only classification of Skolos as a polis is in Steph. Byz. 580 . 7 . According to Strabo 9 . 2 . 23 it was a κώ µ η τηtildeς Παρασωπίας , and Paus. 9 . 4 . 4 has just ερείπια . What justifies the inclusion of Skolos in this inventory is only its membership of the sympoliteia headed by Plataiai (no. 216 ) ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ; Hansen ( 1995 a ) 16 ). Wehave no information about the name of the territory, which must have been very small.Down to 479 Skolos was in Theban territory (Hdt. 9 . 15 . 2 , 65 . 1 ) and probably situated north of the river Asopos, which was the southern border of the territory of Thebes (Hdt. 6 . 108 . 6 ; cf. most recently Munn ( 1987 ) 121 -24 ). After the Persian Wars Skolos became part of Plataian territory and a member of the sympoliteia which for some time constituted two of the eleven Boiotian districts ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ). But by 431 Skolos must have been annexed by Thebes once again, since it was one of the small unwalled settlements whose population was moved to Thebes ( Hell. Oxy. 20 . 3 ) in connection with the major synoecism at the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War (Demand ( 1990 ) 82 -85 ; Moggi, Sin . 197 -204 ). By 395 Skolos had been repopulated.It still belonged to Thebes ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ), but since both Strabo 9 . 2 . 23 and, more importantly, Paus. 9 . 4 . 4 (cf. Wallace ( 1979 ) 89 ) place Skolos south of the river Asopos, the refounded village was probably located south of the Asopos in land that had been Theban territory since the destruction of Plataiai in 426 ."
220,Tanagra (Tanagraios),Boiotia,38.2,23.35,1510,6897,"220 . Tanagra (Tanagraios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 20 , long. 23 . 35 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A. The toponym is Τάναγρα , ηasper (ML 35 , 36 = Lazzarini ( 1976 ) 998 ( c. 458 ); Thuc. 4 . 97 . 1 ), denoting either the town (Heracl. Cret. 8 , GGM i . 101 ) or the polity (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 49 ) or the territory (Thuc. 1 . 108 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is Ταναγραῖος ( LSAG 93 and 95 no. 12 (C6 ); SEG 9 2 . 32 (C4s); Dem. 25 . 60 ) but in Boiotian inscriptions from C4 onwards mostly Ταναγρηtildeος ( IG vii 3055 . 25 (C4m), 2723 . 2 -3 (C3e)), attested already in C5f ( SEG 29 1788 . 7 ; for the date, see Vottéro ( 2001 ) 183 ), and sometimes Ταναγρεῖος ( IG vii 522 . 10 (C3s)). Roller ( 1989 a ) does not record the city-ethnic. Tanagra is called a polis in the urban sense (Aristophanes Boeotus ( FGrHist 379 ) fr. 2 bis = P Oxy . 2463 . 26 ; cf. Heracl. Cret. 8 -10 , GGM i . 101 (C3s)) and in the territorial sense (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 49 ), and is listed as a polis in the political sense (Thuc. 4 . 91 . 1 , 93 . 4 ; Hell . Oxy . 19 . 2 -3 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on a stamped tile of C5f ( SEG 29 1788 . 7 : δα µ οσία Ταναγρήων ) and in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ), and externally on a late C6shield at Olympia commemorating a victory over an unknown enemy ( LSAG 93 and 95 no. 12 ). For the individual and external use of the city-ethnic,see e.g. Σ [ κ ] υθρίωνι Φορ µ ίδα Τανα [ γραίω ] ι , naopoios at Delphi in 335 ( CID ii 76 . ii . 19 -20 ). The territory is called Τάναγρα (Thuc. 3 . 91 . 3 -4 ) or ηasper Ταναγραία (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 4 ) or (later) ηasper Ταναγραϊκή (Strabo 9 . 2 . 11 ). During the First Federation the territory of Tanagra constituted one of the eleven Boiotian districts ( Hell. Oxy. 19 . 3 ); it comprised Delion (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 4 ), Aulis (Nicocrates ( FGrHist 376 ) fr. 1 ; Strabo 9 . 2 . 8 ), Salganeus (Nicocrates ( FGrHist 376 ) fr. 1 ), and what was later called the Tetrakomia , i.e. Heleon, Harma, Mykalessos (no. 212 ) and Pharai (no. 215 ) (Strabo 9 . 2 . 14 ; Fossey ( 1988 ) 43 -99 and 222 -23 ). Tanagra was bordered on the east by Oropos (no. 214 ) (Heracl. Cret. 7 -8 , GGM i . 101 ), on the west by Skolos (no. 219 ), belonging to Thebes (Hdt. 9 . 15 . 2 , 5 . 79 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 49 ) and on the north by Anthedon (no. 200 ) (Nicocrates ( FGrHist 376 ) fr. 1 ) and Glisas (Hdt. 9 . 43 . 2 ), belonging to Thebes (Strabo 9 . 2 . 31 ). Inclusive of the small dependent poleis , its size has been assessed at c. 530 km ² (Fossey ( 1988 ) 28 ). Tanagra was allied with Thebes in 506 and earlier (Hdt. 5 . 79 . 2 ). The city was a member of the First Federation ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ), during which the principal body of government was a boule , to which only propertied citizens were admitted ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 2 , 3 ). It was a member of the Second Federation (Isoc. 14 . 9 ), providing one Boiotarch ( SEG 25 553 = 32 476 . 14 (C4f); for the date, see SEG 45 431 and Vottéro ( 2001 ) 71 ), and of the Third Federation ( IG vii 2724 . 7 ( c. 280 -270 )). Tanagran citizens were appointed proxenoi by Delphi (no. 177 ; SGDI 2674 ( c. 328 )) and Eretria (no. 370 ) ( IG xii . 9 203 (C4s)). The Aristotelian collection of politeiai seems to have included a Constitution of Tanagra (Plut. Mor . 299 C; Hansen ( 1995 a ) 53 ), which reported a tradition that the territory of Tanagra had once been inhabited καταgrave κώ µ ας (Moggi, Sin . 82 -84 ). During the crisis of 330 -326 , Tanagra received 10 , 000 medimnoi of grain from Kyrene (no. 1028 ) (RO 96 . 32 ). The protecting god of Tanagra seems to have been Hermes,with the epithets Kriophoros and Promachos,each with his own temple-that of Promachos near the theatre (Paus. 9 . 22 . 1 -2 (rC5m); LSAG 92 and 94 no. 7 (C7l-C6e); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) ii. 44 -50 ; iii. 50 ). Other major divinities attested in the Archaic and Classical periods are Artemis Eileithyia ( IG vii 546 (C5 ), 458 (C4 -C3 ); Paus. 9 . 22 . 1 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 193 ), Athena Longatis ( SEG 31 497 (C4l-C3e)), Demeter Gephyraia (Hdt. 5 . 57 -61 ; REG 12 ( 1899 ) 53 -115 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 162 -63 ); Dionysos ( IG vii 550 (C5 ); Paus. 9 . 20 . 4 (rC5 ); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 183 -85 ), Herakles ( SEG 34 367 : kantharoi inscribed ιasperαρός and ' Ηρακλέους (C6s); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) ii. 12 ; Andriomenou ( 1985 ) 113 ). According to Thuc. 1 . 108 . 2 -3 , Tanagra was a walled city in 457 , but following the battle of Oinophyta the Tanagrans had their walls demolished by the Athenians (cf. Diod. 11 . 82 . 5 ). The existing circuit of 2 . 2 km with forty-three towers was of mudbrick on a mostly isodomic ashlar sockle; it can be dated to the period c. 425 -375 and may have been erected after the King's Peace in 386 (Roller ( 1974 ), ( 1987 )). Xenophon's mention at Hell . 5 . 4 . 49 of τοgrave τεῖχος , however, must refer to the Theban stockade and not to the walls of Tanagra (Munn ( 1987 ) 124 -26 ). The city walls enclose an area of 30 ha (Roller ( 1987 ) 223 ). Except, perhaps, for a temple of Hermes Promachos near the theatre (Paus. 9 . 22 . 2 ), all architectural remains seem to be later than the C4 circuit; and the orthogonal town plan, with insulae of 52 × 102 m, was clearly devised to fit the existing walls. Nothing of Archaic and C5 Tanagra is visible today (Roller ( 1989 b ) 157 ); but a surface survey of the town has been carried out by a team from Leiden, and a geo-prospection team has reconstructed the C4street and insula plan across the city ( Teiresias 32 ( 2002 ) 1 ). A depression in the ground is all that is left of a theatre seen by early travellers. It seems to be an integral part of the urban plan of C4f (Roller ( 1989 b ) 152 -54 ). Herakleides describes Tanagra as a town inhabited by farmers ( 9 , GGM i . 101 , 9 ). Outside the city walls a cemetery has been excavated with some 500 graves, the majority from C6l and C5s (Andriomenou ( 1985 )). Tanagra struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard from c. 500 to 446 , and from before 410 to 374 (or later) (Hansen ( 1995 a ) 20 -21 ), and bronze coins from c. 338 to 315 . Denominations: drachm, hemidrachm, obol. ( 1 ) Silver, c. 500 -480 : obv . Boiotian shield with ΤΤ or ΤΑ in the side openings; rev . mill-sail incuse. Legend: Τ or ΤΤ (some).( 2 ) Silver, c. 480 -456 : obv . Boiotian shield with ΤΤ or ΤΑ in the side openings; rev . spokes of a wheel. Legend: ΒΟ or ΒΟΙ or ΤΑ . ( 3 ) Silver, c. 456 -446 and C5l-C4f: obv . Boiotian shield; rev . forepart or head of horse (mostly). Legend: ΤΑ or ΤΑΝ or ΤΑΝΑ . ( 4 ) Bronze, c. 338 -315 : obv . Boiotian shield; rev .

C. 560 Tanagra joined Megara (no. 225 ) in colonising Herakleia Pontike (no. 715 ) (Paus. 5 . 26 . 7 ; Burstein ( 1976 ) 15 -18 )."
221,Thebai (Thebaios),Boiotia,38.2,23.2,3687,16906,"221 . Thebai (Thebaios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 20 , long. 23 . 20 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A. The toponym is Φηtildeβαι , αιasper ( LSAG 93 and 95 no. 16 ( c. 470 ); Hom. Il . 5 . 804 ); the singular Θήβη or Θήβα is sometimes found in poetry (Hom. Il . 4 . 378 ; IG vii 2470 . 1 ( c. 300 )). The toponym denotes either the town(Hdt. 1 . 92 . 1 ) or the polity (Dem. 19 . 325 ) or the territory (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 25 ). The toponym is attested in linear B tablets. The composite ' Υπόθηβαι (Hom. Il 2 . 505 ) may refer to the early town built at the base of the Kadmeia = Thebai proper (letter from Schachter). The cityethnic is Θηβαίος ( LSAG 92 and 94 no. 7 (C6f); Hdt. 5 . 79 . 2 ), in the Boiotian dialect often Θειβηtildeος ( SEG 28 465 . 4 (C4s)). Thebes is called a polis in the urban sense (Hes. Scut . 105 (C6 ); Thgn. 1 . 1209 ; Pind. Pyth . 12 . 26 ; Bacchyl. 9 . 54 ; Hdt. 9 . 86 . 1 ; Dem. 18 . 216 ), in the political sense (Hdt. 9 . 13 . 3 ; Thuc. 3 . 62 . 3 -4 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 5 . 8 ; Arist. Rh . 1398 b 18 -20 ; Dem. 19 . 138 -41 ; RO 88 . 33 (C4 ); SEG 28 265 . 3 -4 (C4m, but C4l by Gullath ( 1982 ) 112 -13 )), and in the territorial sense (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 49 ; Isoc. 14 . 35 ). The term polisma is found at Men. Sam . 325 , and άστυ is used by Dem. 18 . 215 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins of C5s (Head ( 1881 ) 31 -32 ) and externally on a dedication in Olympia of C6s ( SEG 24 300 ). For the individual and external use of the city-ethnic, see Ducat ( 1971 ) no. 232 : ' Επιχάρες h ο Θεβ [ αῖος ] (dedication in Ptoion (C6s)). Patris is found in Pind. Isthm . 1 . 12 ; Xen. Hell . 7 . 5 . 18 , An . 3 . 1 . 4 ; Dem. 18 . 177 ; Aeschin. 2 . 164 ; CEG ii 635 (C4 ). The territory is called Θηβαιdieresisacuteς (Hdt. 9 . 65 . 1 ; Thuc. 3 . 58 . 5 ) or Θηtildeβαι (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 25 ) or in later sources sometimes Θηβαία (Strabo 9 . 2 . 26 ). Before 506 Thebaïs extended south of the Asopos, but in 506 the river was made the border between Thebes and Plataiai (no. 216 ) (Hdt. 6 . 108 . 6 ; Paus. 9 . 4 . 4 ), and the territory of Thebes may then have comprised both Haliartos (no. 206 ) (inference from Hdt. 5 . 79 . 2 ) and presumably Akraiphia (no. 198 ) with Apollo's sanctuary at Ptoion (Hdt. 8 . 135 . 1 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 69 ; cf. also Strabo 9 . 2 . 34 ; Paus. 9 . 23 . 5 ). To the east, Theban territory may have reached the coast and included Delion (Hdt. 6 . 118 . 2 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 46 ). After the battle of Plataiai, Thebes was probably deprived of most of its former territory including the Tetrakomia (Hdt. 9 . 43 . 2 ; Fossey ( 1988 ) 222 -23 , probably relating to the period c. 450 -430 ; cf. Hansen ( 1995 a ) 37 with n. 137 ) and Delion (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 4 ). But at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War the Thebaïs must have comprised all the small towns that joined the synoecism and had their populations moved to Thebes ( Hell . Oxy . 20 . 3 ). The size of its territory c. 435 has been assessed at c. 650 km ² (Bakhuizen ( 1994 ) 314 ). In 427 / 6 the territory of Plataiai was incorporated into Thebes (Thuc. 3 . 68 . 2 -3 , 5 . 17 . 2 ). In 395 the Thebaïs constituted two of the eleven Boiotian districts and controlled the two Plataian districts as well ( Hell. Oxy. 19 . 3 ) plus Oropos (no. 214 ) (Diod. 14 . 17 . 1 -3 ) and Aulis (Xen. Hell . 3 . 5 . 5 ). Thebes suffered its next major set-back during the Spartan occupation in 382 -379 (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 25 -36 , 4 . 1 -12 ), but when the Boiotian Federation had been re-established in 378 -374 , Thebes extended its territory to include Plataiai (from 373 : Xen. Hell . 6 . 3 . 1 ; Paus. 9 . 1 . 5 -8 ), Thespiai (after 377 : Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 46 -48 , but before the autumn of 371 : Xen. Hell . 6 . 3 . 5 ; Isoc. 8 . 17 ), Kreusis (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 3 ) and Oropos (from 366 : Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 1 ). We have no information about Anthedon (no. 200 ) (Gullath ( 1989 ) 164 ), and we do not know whether Orchomenos (no. 213 ) was annexed by Thebes after its destruction in 364 (Diod. 15 . 79 . 3 -6 ). During the Third Sacred War, Koroneia (no. 210 ) and Orchomenos were held by the Phokians,but in 346 Philip handed them back to the Thebans (Dem. 5 . 21 -22 ). Thebaïs must now have been bordered by Thisbai, Haliartos,Akraiphia, Tanagra (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 49 ) and Athens ( πόλις αστυγείτων : Aeschin. 3 . 133 ; Din. 1 . 38 ) and most have covered c. 800 km ² . In 338 Thebes lost Plataiai, Orchomenos (Paus. 4 . 27 . 10 ), Thespiai and Oropos (Paus. 1 . 34 . 1 ), and after the destruction of Thebes in 335 , what remained of its territory was given to the neighbouring cities (Hyp. 6 . 17 ; Diod. 18 . 11 . 3 -4 ; Paus. 1 . 25 . 4 ; Gullath ( 1982 ) 77 -82 ). After the victory at Plataiai in 479 , Thebes was besieged by the Greek army until it surrendered the leaders of the pro-Persian faction (Hdt. 9 . 86 -88 ). Shortly after the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War many small unfortified Boiotian towns were synoecised with Thebes,which thereby doubled its population. The towns merged with Thebes included Erythrai (no. 203 ), Eteonos/Skaphai (no. 204 ), Skolos (no. 219 ), (Au)lis, Schoinos and Potniai (no. 217 ) ( Hell . Oxy . 20 . 3 ; Demand ( 1990 ) 83 -85 ; Moggi, Sin . 197 -204 prefers a date c. 426 -424 ). From 382 to 379 Thebes had to suffer a Spartan occupation (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 25 -36 , 4 . 1 -12 ); and bythe peace of 338 a Makedonian garrison was placed on the Kadmeia (Diod. 16 . 87 . 3 ). In 335 Thebes was conquered by Alexander and razed to the ground (Din. 1 . 24 ; Arr. Anab . 1 . 7 -9 ; Diod. 17 . 7 -14 ; Plut. Alex . 11 . 6 -12 ; Gullath ( 1982 ) 60 -85 ). More than 6 , 000 men were killed, and the remaining population, some 30 , 000 men, women and children, were exposed to andrapodismos and sold into slavery (Din. 1 . 24 ; Arr. Anab . 1 . 9 . 9 ; Diod. 17 . 13 . 3 , 14 . 1 ; Plut. Alex . 11 . 12 ). Thebes was the leading member of the First Federation (Thuc. 4 . 91 . 1 ; Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 ); it re-established the Federation immediately after the liberation of the city in 379 (Plut. Pelop . 13 . 1 ) and dominated all the other member states (Isoc. 14 . 8 -10 ; Aeschin. 3 . 142 ); and in spite of the defeat in 338 , Thebes was still a member of the Third Federation between 338 and the destruction of the city in 335 (Arr. Anab . 1 . 7 . 11 ; CID ii 74 . i . 72 ( 337 / 6 )). Membership of the Boiotian Federation did not prevent Thebes from joining one of the major leagues or from entering into alliance with other poleis : during the 370 s Thebes was a member of the Second Athenian Naval Confederacy ( IG ii² 40 , 43 . 24 -25 , 79 ; IG ii² 1607 . 155 ) and in 339 Athens concluded an alliance with Thebes, not with the Boiotian Federation (Aeschin. 3 . 142 ; Staatsverträge 345 ). Theban laws were traditionally ascribed to Philolaos of Corinth (Arist. Pol . 1274 a 31 -32 ), who probably lived in C7s. The Aristotelian collection of politeiai included a Constitution of Thebes (Arist. frr. 506 -7 ). Down to the Spartan occupation of Kadmeia in 382 -379 Thebes was an oligarchy, in C6l-C5e of the narrow type ( dynasteia : Thuc. 3 . 62 . 3 ), later a more moderate oligarchy (ibid.; Arist. Pol . 1278 a 25 ) ruled by a boule based on a property qualification ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 2 ). A bronze phiale of C6f is dedicated by λε/Koppaτοιgrave Θεβαῖοι , perhaps members of the nobility (Lazzarini ( 1976 ) no. 920 , cf. p. 156 ), perhaps a body of officials ( LSAG 92 and 94 no. 7 ; cf. Schachter ( 1989 ) 79 ), or, rather, a military elite (Schachter, forthcoming). The Athenian victory at Oinophyta in 457 (Thuc. 1 . 108 . 3 ; Pl. Menex . 242 B) and stasis in Thebes (Thuc. 3 . 62 . 5 , 4 . 92 . 6 ) were followed by a brief period of democracy (Arist. Pol . 1302 b 28 -9 ). The Athenians were expelled, autonomia recovered, exiles recalled and oligarchy restored after the Athenian defeat at Koroneia in 447 / 6 (Thuc. 1 . 113 . 2 -4 , 3 . 62 . 3 ). The principal body of government was a boule , to which only propertied citizens were admitted ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 2 , 3 ). In C4e the leading oligarchs were divided into a proAthenian and a pro-Lakedaimonian faction ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 1 , 20 . 1 ), and after a protracted stasis the pro-Lakedaimonians came to power in 382 with the Spartan occupation of Thebes (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 25 -36 ). Between 382 and 379 the constitution was again a dynasteia (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 46 ). From 379 onwards Thebes was a democracy (Diod. 15 . 79 . 3 ; Polyb. 6 . 43 ; Buckler ( 1980 ) 20 ). In collusion with a faction in Thebes, some Theban exiles made an abortive attempt in 364 to reintroduce an aristocratic constitution (Diod. 15 . 79 . 3 -5 ). Thebes had a boule (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 29 ), which prepared the matters to be put to the assembly (Diod. 17 . 9 . 1 ). An oracular response refers to a meeting of the popular assembly in 506 (Hdt. 5 . 79 . 1 ). It is unknown what powers it had during the oligarchy down to 379 , but from then on major decisions were made by the people in assembly (Aeschin. 2 . 105 ; Dem. 18 . 213 ; Ar. Anab . 1 . 7 . 2 ). An eponymous archon is attested in C4s ( SEG 28 466 ( c. 338 )) and polemarchs from 382 (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 25 ; Schaefer ( 1956 ) 1108 -11 ). Thebes awarded proxenia to citizens from Opous (no. 386 ) (schol. Pind. Ol . 9 . 123 c (C5f)), from Athens (no. 361 ) (Demosthenes:Aeschin. 2 . 141 ; Thrason: Aeschin. 3 . 138 ), and from unknown poleis ( IG vii 2409 (C4m-C3m); cf.Vottéro ( 2001 ) 159 ; SEG 28 465 (C4s)). Theban citizens were appointed proxenoi by Athens (no. 361 ) (Pindar, Isoc. 15 . 166 ), Delphi (no. 177 ) ( F.Delphes iii . 1 356 ( 327 )); and Karthaia (no. 492 ) ( IG xii . 5 542 . 27 (C4m)). The protective divinities of Thebes were probably Demeter Thesmophoros and Dionysos Kadmeios (Pind. Isthm . 7 . 1 -5 ; Eur. Bacch . 1 -12 ; Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 29 ; Paus. 9 . 15 . 5 -6 ; Brackertz ( 1976 ) 73 -78 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 168 , 187 ), but Athena Onka (Aesch. Sept . 164 -65 ) and Athena Pronoia ( ArchDelt 3 ( 1917 ) 36 . 2 ) are also attested as the protectors of Thebes (Soph. OT 18 -19 ; SEG 32 493 (C4l); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 129 -32 ). Other major divinities attested in the Archaic and Classical periods are Herakles Promachos, whose sanctuary was outside the walls (Pind. Nem . 4 . 22 -24 ; Isoc. 5 . 32 ; Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 7 ; Paus. 9 . 11 . 4 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) ii. 14 -30 ); Aphrodite, the divine patron of the Theban polemarchs, whose sanctuary was on the Kadmeia (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 4 -7 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 38 -41 ); Apollo Ismenios, whose sanctuary was on the Ismenion hill ( IG vii 2455 (C6 ); SEG 22 417 (C6 ); Pind. Pyth . 11 . 1 -11 ; Paus. 9 . 10 . 2 ; Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 77 -85 ). The major extra-urban cults were Zeus Hypatos (Paus. 9 . 19 . 3 ), in whose sanctuary on Mt. Hypaton some remains of the Classical period have been found (Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) iii. 102 ); and the Kabiroi: a mother goddess,her consort and two attending Kabiroi,usually represented as Hermes and Pan. It was a mystery cult reserved for the initiated and situated at the Kabirion, a natural cavity c. 5 . 5 km west of Thebes. Monumental architecture at the sanctuary dates from the Heltic and Roman periods. The cult is attested from the Geometric to the Roman imperial period ( IG vii 2457 (C6 -C5 ), cf. SEG 36 458 ; Schachter ( 1986 -94 ) ii. 66 -110 , ( 2003 )). Theorodokoi were appointed in 359 to host theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 94 .a. 4 ); in 360 / 59 Thebes was granted promanteia by the Delphians (no. 177 ) ( F.Delphes . iii . 4 375 ). The Theban Ismenias was hieromnemon in 341 ( CID ii 43 . 229 ). Citizens of Thebes are frequently attested as victors at the major Panhellenic festivals, e.g. at the Isthmian Games (Pind. Isthm . 1 , 3 -4 , 7 (in 474 , 458 and 454 )), at the Nemean Games (schol. Pind. Isthm . 223 . 10 , Drachmann ( 470 s)), at the Olympic Games (Paus. 5 . 8 . 7 ( 680 ); see Olympionikai 33 , 69 , 136 , 206 , 352 , 427 , 441 ), at the Pythian Games (Pind. Pyth . 11 ( 474 ); Paus. 10 . 7 . 7 (r 378 ), 7 . 8 (r 346 )), and at the Amphiareia ( IG vii 414 . 4 , 24 , = I.Oropos 520 ( 329 / 8 )). The city dedicated a treasury at Delphi to commemorate the victory at Leuktra (Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 129 -30 ). Thebes is called a fortified city in c. 540 (Thgn. 1 . 1209 ) and again in 479 (Hdt. 9 . 41 . 2 , 9 . 86 -88 ), but it is uncertain whether the references are to the acropolis wall or to a wall enclosing the lower city as well, referred to at Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 53 . In C4 the city had two circuits (Arr. Anab . 1 . 7 . 9 -10 , 8 . 5 -6 ): an acropolis wall around the Kadmeia with the seven famous gates (Pind. Pyth . 11 . 12 ; Paus. 9 . 8 . 4 ) enclosed an area of c. 32 ha, and a wall around the lower city enclosed an area of 350 ha (Bintliff ( 1997 a ) 243 ). Only a few traces are left (Symeonoglou ( 1985 ) 119 ). The acropolis wall seems to have followed the line of the late Helladic cyclopean wall, and the surviving traces of polygonal and isodomic masonry may be no more than Archaic and Classical repairs of the late Helladic wall (cf. Hes. Scut . 105 ). The short south side of the acropolis wall seems to have been a part of the city wall as well (Arr. Anab . 1 . 7 . 9 -10 ). The great city wall was of mudbrick superimposed on a foundation of isodomic masonry and covered with tiles. The masonry suggests a C5 date. The synoecism of 431 must be the terminus ante quem , and the most likely terminus post quem seems to be the liberation of Boiotia from Athenian domination in 446 (Symeonoglou ( 1985 ) 118 -22 ). The city wall was demolished in 335 (Aeschin. 3 . 157 ), but the acropolis wall was probably left to protect the Makedonian garrison on the Kadmeia (Hyp. 6 . 17 ; Arr. Anab . 1 . 9 . 9 ). In the Archaic period much of the Kadmeia was inhabited (Fossey ( 1988 ) 204 ), but some Thebans,including Pindar, lived in the lower city (Paus. 9 . 25 . 3 ), which became densely populated after the erection of the greater circuit in C5m and the synoecism of c. 431 ( Hell . Oxy . 20 . 3 ). In the Classical period Thebes had at least twenty-three sanctuaries, twelve on the Kadmeia and eleven in the lower city (Symeonoglou ( 1985 ) 123 -37 ). South-east of the Kadmeia are remains of the temple of Apollo Ismenias, built in C8s, rebuilt c. 700 and again in C4 (Symeonoglou ( 1985 ) site 8 pp. 236 -8 ), and in the lower town were found the foundations of a temple of the Classical period (Symeonoglou ( 1985 ) site 229 p. 299 ). The Theban boule (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 29 ), as well as the federal council ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 4 ) and the Boiotarchs (Aeschin. 3 . 145 ), had their meeting place on the Kadmeia.In lower Thebes was the polemarcheion (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 6 ), a hippodrome (Paus 9 . 23 . 2 ; Symeonoglou ( 1985 ) 140 and cat. no. 106 ), a C5stadion and gymnasion (Paus. 9 . 23 . 1 ; Symeonoglou ( 1985 ) 140 cat. nos. 65 , 169 ); an earlier stadion and gymnasion (of C6 ?) was situated outside the walls (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 25 ; Symeonoglou ( 1985 ) 108 -9 ). The agora in the lower city was flanked with several stoas (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 29 ; Diod. 12 . 70 . 5 ). Thebes had a theatre (Paus. 9 . 16 . 6 ), which in C4 was used for meetings of the assembly (Plut. Mor . 799 E-F); traces have been found in the northern part of the lower city (Symeonoglou ( 1985 ) 189 -90 ). The city got most of its water through an impressive system of subterranean aqueducts already famous in antiquity (Heracl. Cret. 13 , GGM i . 102 ) and still partly preserved (Symeonoglou ( 1985 ) 141 -44 ). Thebes struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard from c. 500 to 335 . Denominations: stater, drachm, hemidrachm, obol, hemiobol, tetartemorion, in C4 also tritemorion; obv . mostly Boiotian shield; rev . down to 479 : mill-sail; thereafter Herakles or Dionysos or amphora with symbols relating to Herakles or Dionysos.Legend: first Θ , later various abbreviations of the city-ethnic or occasionally the full form: ΘΕΒΑΙΟΝ . An abbreviated personal name, denoting the issuing magistrate, appears on the C4 amphora-type coins, and forty-five separate magistrates can be identified (Hepworth ( 1986 ) 35 ). A series of probably Theban coins struck c. 386 -379 have a kantharos on the rev . and the legend ΒΟΙ or ΒΟΙΩ . Some rare gold coins of C5l have obv . head of bearded Dionysos; rev . infant Herakles strangling serpents. Legend: ΘΕ . A small series of C4 bronze obols have obv . head of young Herakles; rev . club and other symbols and magistrate's name (Head ( 1881 ) 11 , 16 -18 , 23 -24 , 29 -42 , 54 -55 , 61 -72 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) 109 -14 ; Schachter ( 1989 ) 85 ; SNG Cop. Boeotia 241 -355 ). C. 560 Thebes joined Megara (no. 225 ) in colonising Herakleia Pontike (no. 715 ) ( Suda Η 461 ; cf. Burstein ( 1976 ) 15 -18 )."
222,Thespiai (Thespieus),Boiotia,38.15,23.1,1956,8915,"222 . Thespiai (Thespieus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 15 , long. 23 . 10 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Θεσπιαί , αιasper (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 10 ; IG vii 1862 (Roman)), but Θέσπεια at Hom. Il . 2 . 498 and Hdt. 8 . 50 . 2 . The toponym denotes either the town ( IG iv² . 1 94 .a. 6 ; Dem. 6 . 30 ) or the polity (IsoC8 . 17 ) or the territory (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 41 ). The city-ethnic is Θεσπιευacuteς ( F.Delphes iii . 4 148 (C5f); Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 20 ). At Hes. Op . 222 , πόλις probably denotes Thespiai. In sources of the Classical period Thespiai is called a polis in the urban sense (Hdt. 8 . 50 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 6 . 3 . 1 ; Dem. 16 . 25 ) and in the political sense ( IG i³ 72 . 6 , 16 (C5l); Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 46 ; Hell . Oxy . 19 . 2 -3 ; Isoc. 8 . 17 ; Dem. 16 . 25 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a proxeny decree of C3m ( SEG 32 496 . 2 -3 ) and externally on the Serpent Column (ML 27 . 6 : Θεσπι ˜ ες ( 479 )). The individual and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in an Athenian proxeny decree of C5m for four named Thespians ( IG i³ 23 ) and in Delphic inscriptions where a Thespian appears as naopoios at Delphi in 334 ( CID ii 79 A. 15 ). In the feminine, the ktetikon Θεσπική is sometimes used ( IG ii² 8834 (C4 )). Patra ( = patris ) has been restored in CEG ii 788 ( c. 350 ). The territory is called ηasper Θεσπικηgrave γηtilde (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 3 ); ηasper τῶν Θεσπιῶν χώρα (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 42 ) or just ηasper Θεσπική (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 4 ); Anth. Pal . iii . 19 . 2 (r 480 ) has Θεσπιάς . During the First Federation, Thespiai constituted two of the eleven Boiotian districts ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 ), including Siphai (no. 218 ) (Thuc. 4 . 76 . 3 ), Leuktra (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 4 ), Eutresis (no. 205 ) and Thisbai (no. 223 ; Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ), Chorsiai (no. 202 ) ( SEG 24 361 , but cf. 47 520 ), Kreusis (Ps.-Skylax 38 , as restored by Roesch ( 1980 ); Livy 36 . 21 . 5 ; but Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 3 shows that in 371 it belonged to Thebes), Askra (Hes. Op . 639 -40 with 222 ; Arist. fr. 580 ), Keressos (Paus. 9 . 14 . 1 -4 ; Plut. Cam . 19 . 4 ; Mor . 866 F), Donakon (Paus. 9 . 31 . 7 ) and perhaps Hippotai (Plut. Mor 775 A; Schachter ( 1996 a ) 104 ). Including the dependent poleis of Chorsiai, Thisbai, Siphai and Eutresis (no. 205 ), its territory covered c. 425 km ² . Excluding these, it came to some 200 km ² . Thespiai bordered on Haliartos (no. 206 ) to the north, on Thebes to the east (Hdt. 5 . 79 . 2 ), on Plataiai (no. 216 ) to the south-east (Hdt. 8 . 50 . 2 ), and on Thisbai to the south-west (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 3 -4 ). Thespiai was allied with Thebes in 506 and earlier (Hdt. 5 . 79 . 2 ). Seven hundred Thespians were killed at Thermopylai in 480 (Hdt. 7 . 202 . 1 ; cf. Anth. Pal . iii . 19 ), and the Thespians fled to the Peloponnese when the Persians attacked Boiotia and burned down the city of Thespiai (Hdt. 8 . 50 . 2 ). A force of 1 , 800 light-armed Thespians fought in the battle of Plataiai in 479 (Hdt. 9 . 30 . 1 ), and the Thespians are duly recorded on the Serpent Column commemorating the victory (ML 27 . 6 ). Thespiai was resettled and the Thespians admitted extra citizens to make up for the losses during the war (Hdt. 8 . 75 . 5 ; Schachter ( 1996 a ) 115 ). The city was a member of the First Federation and provided two Boiotarchs ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 -4 ). The Thespians suffered severe losses in 424 in the battle of Delion (Thuc. 4 . 96 . 3 , 133 . 1 ) and 101 names are recorded in the public funeral monument set up after the battle ( IG vii 1888 ). The Thespians fought in the Boiotian army in the battle of the Nemea in 394 (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 20 ; cf. SEG 2 186 , 47519 ). Thespiai was garrisoned by the Spartans in 379 and 378 , under the supremacy of a harmost (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 15 , 41 ), but by the mid-370 s Thebes had regained control of the neighbouring poleis , probably including Thespiai (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 63 ). By 372 the Thespians had been forced by the Thebans to join the Second Federation (Isoc. 14 . 9 : συντελεῖν εις ταgraveς Θήβας ), providing one Boiotarch ( SEG 25 553 . 14 (C4f: for the date, see SEG 45 431 and Vottéro ( 2001 ) 71 )). Before the autumn of 371 (Xen. Hell . 6 . 3 . 5 , 6 . 4 . 10 ) the city was sacked by the Thebans and depopulated (Diod. 15 . 46 . 6 ; Isoc. 6 . 27 ; Dem. 16 . 4 , 25 , 28 ). The Thespians, or some of them, withdrew to nearby Keressos (Paus. 9 . 14 . 2 ), but probably only after the sack of Thespiai (Tuplin ( 1986 ) 333 -34 ; Buck ( 1994 ) 110 with n. 46 ). In 359 , however, a Thespian theorodokos hosted theoroi sent from Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 94 .a. 6 ), and Aischylos of Thespiai was a victor in the Olympic Games, probably in 348 ( IAG 26 ; Olympionikai 444 ); so Demosthenes' contention ( 19 . 325 ) that the city was still not rebuilt in 346 must be taken with a grain of salt. The Thespians took an active part in the destruction of Thebes in 335 (Diod. 17 . 13 . 5 ), and in C3e the city was resettled (Plut. Dem . 39 . 5 ; IG vii 1747 and 1751 , military catalogues of C3e). The constitution of Thespiai was oligarchic and based on a property qualification ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 46 ). A democratic uprising in 414 was immediately quelled by the Thebans (Thuc. 6 . 95 . 2 ; Gehrke, Stasis 172 ). In 378 the constitution is classified as a dynasteia , and the democratic faction as living in exile in Thebes (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 46 ). The principal body of government was a boule , to which only propertied citizens were admitted ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 2 , 3 ). An eponymous archon is attested c. 386 ( SEG 24 361 . 3 ; Sherk ( 1990 ) 287 ). The Aristotelian collection of politeiai included a Constitution of Thespiai (Heracl. Lemb. 76 = no. 59 , Gigon). Thespian citizens were appointed proxenoi by Athens (no. 361 ) ( IG i³ 23 ) and Delphi (no. 177 ) ( F.Delphes iii . 1 96 ( 318 -306 ), 416 (C4l)). Apollo Archegetas seems to have been the protecting god of Thespiai. His cult was associated with the foundation of the polis , and was performed in a Doric peristyle temple of C5 , c. 2 km south-west of Thespiai ( SEG 2 237 (C5f); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 88 -89 , ( 1996 a ) 103 ). Other major cults attested in the Archaic and Classical periods are the nine Muses, whose sanctuary was in the Valley of the Muses c. 6 km west of Thespiai (Hes. Op . 654 -59 ; Paus. 9 . 30 . 1 (rC4e); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) ii. 151 -58 ), Herakles ( BCH 50 ( 1926 ) 390 . 4 ; SEG 15 324 (C5f); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) ii. 34 -35 ), Dionysos ( IG vii 1794 (C5 ); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 192 -95 ), Zeus Karaios ( SEG 32 505 (C4l)); Zeus Saotes ( Anth . Pal . 6 . 344 ( 330 / 29 ); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) iii. 150 -53 ), and the Daimones (Michel 1102 ( c. 300 ); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 149 ). Surveys have shown that 'the early city consisted of at least four separate nuclei, spread out over a total area of about 100 ha' . In C5 and C4 they were merged together into one large conurbation (Snodgrass ( 1987 -89 ) 57 ). Remains of the Geometric and Archaic periods,however,are scarce,and it has been suggested that the centre of Thespiai before 480 was at the temple of Apollo, and that the settlement was moved to its Classical site only after the Persian destruction in 480 (Schachter ( 1996 a ) 103 -4 ). The walls were demolished by the Thebans in 423 (Thuc. 4 . 133 . 1 ), re-erected with Spartan help in 378 (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 41 ), demolished once more by the Thebans (Dem. 6 . 30 ; Isoc. 14 . 19 , 35 ), probably before 373 / 2 (the date of Isoc. Plat .) and not yet rebuilt in 343 (Dem. 19 . 112 ). Three huge square blocks of the Classical city wall were discovered in 1987 (Bintliff and Snodgrass ( 1988 ) 67 ). The settlements covered an area of at least 50 and perhaps more than 100 ha (Bintliff ( 1997 a ) 243 ). Thespiai struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard from c. 500 to 480 and from 386 (or earlier) to 374 (or later), and bronze coins from c. 338 to 315 . ( 1 ) Silver, c. 500 -480 , denominations: stater, drachm, hemidrachm, obol; obv . Boiotian shield, some with Θ in one of the openings of the shield; rev . the letter Θ in mill-sail incuse square. The epichoric letter ( ), originally interpreted as a Φ and associated with Pharai (no. 215 ), but now interpreted as a Θ signifying Thespiai (Etienne and Knoepfler ( 1976 ) 219 ).

223,Thisbai (Thisbeus),Boiotia,38.15,23.0,624,2888,"223 . Thisbai (Thisbeus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 15 , long. 23 . 00 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: B. The toponym is Θίσβη , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 502 ) or more frequently Θίσβαι in the plural ( Hell. Oxy. 19 . 3 ; F.Delphes iii . 3 103 . 3 ( 300 -280 )), denoting the polity ( Hell . Oxy . 19 . 3 ) or the territory (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 3 ). The cityethnic is Θισβευacuteς ( IG vii 2724 .b. 6 ( c. 280 -270 ); SEG 15 , 282 . 4 ( 263 -255 )). The earliest attestation of Thisbai as a polis is in a treaty with Chorsiai of C2e ( SEG 3 342 . 4 = Migeotte ( 1984 ) no. 11 ), and the only attestation in a literary source is Paus. 9 . 32 . 2 . The occurrence in C4l of a Thisban among the aphedriateuontes , however, shows that Thisbai was a polis at least from the beginning of the Third Federation ( IG vii 2724 b. 6 ( c. 280 -270 )), and the reference at Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 to what was probably a sympoliteia between Thespiai (no. 222 ), Eutresis (no. 205 ) and Thisbai suggests that during the First Federation Thisbai was a dependent polis dominated by Thespiai (Roesch ( 1965 ) 37 ; Siewert ( 1977 ) 463 ; Hansen ( 1995 a ) 16 ); cf. τοῖ Θεσπιέσσιν καιgrave τοῖρ συgraveν αυτοgraveς ( SEG 31 358 . 5 (C5f)). The size of its territory has been assessed at just over 100 km ² (Fossey ( 1988 ) 176 ). A funeral epigram of c. 500 indicates that the population of Thisbai consisted of citizens ( astoi ) and foreigners ( xenoi ) ( CEG 112 ). The only cults at Thisbai attested in sources of the Archaic and Classical periods are of Athena ( IG vii 2230 (C6 -C5 ); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 133 ) and, perhaps, Demeter Achaia ( BCH 50 ( 1926 ) 418 n. 4 (C3s); Schachter ( 1981 -94 ) i. 170 ; for the date, see Vottéro ( 2001 ) 256 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in Thisbai's copy of a treaty with Chorsiai ( SEG 3 342 = Migeotte ( 1984 ) no. 11 (C2e)), but externally only in a Roman inscription ( IG vii 2870 . 13 ( ad 155 )). For the individual and external use, see e.g. Πυacuteρρακος ' Ιθουδα µ ίω Θισβεῖος in a list of aphedriateuontes ( IG vii 2724 b. 4 ( c. 280 -270 )). The territory was called Θίσβαι (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 3 ). Thisbai is attested as a member of the First Federation ( Hell. Oxy . 19 . 3 ) and of the Third Federation ( IG vii 2724 b. 4 ( c. 280 -270 )). A circuit of c. 2 . 5 km with interval square towers enclosed the city, which was situated with a rocky hill to the north, the foot of Mt. Helikon to the south, and in the narrow corridor between the two. Most of the wall is of pseudo-isodomic trapezoidal or ashlar work, but one round tower on the northern hill (the acropolis) is in Lesbian masonry (Maier ( 1958 )). The circuit enclosed an area of c. 48 . 5 ha (Bintliff ( 1997 a ) 244 ). Maier ( 1958 ) 24 -25 suggests a date between c. 325 and 175 , but the tower indicates a date between 375 and ## II.

224,Aigosthena (Aigosthenitas),"Megaris, Korinthia, Sikyonia",38.1,23.15,334,1627,"224 . Aigosthena (Aigosthenitas) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 10 , long. 23 . 15 . Size of territory: probably 1 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Αιγόσθενα , τά (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 18 ). The city-ethnic is Αιγοσθενίτας ( IG vii 1 . 5 ( c. 300 ); 43 . 2 (C3 )) or ' Ηγοσθενίτης ( IG vii 207 . 4 (C3s)). Aigosthena was situated in the territory of Megara (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 18 : τηtildeς Μεγαρικηtildeς εν Αιγοσθένοις ; cf. 6 . 4 . 26 ). In a difficult chapter, Ps.-Skylax 39 (on which see FlenstedJensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 -43 ) refers to a plurality of poleis in Megaris under the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε , and the toponym Aigosthena has been plausibly restored from the MS reading λιγόθθειναι which follows this heading; accepting this,Aigosthena is here listed as a polis in the urban sense in a C4source. C3sources use polis in the political sense about the city ( IG vii 207 . 4 , 10 (C3s); 208 . 19 , 21 ; 213 . 10 , 219 . 5 (C3s-C2e)) and in C3s a citizen of Aigosthena served as Delphic theorodokos ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) ii . 28 ). This suggests that Aigosthena may in fact have been a polis by C4 , as indicated by Ps.-Skylax. However, an inscription of c. 300 describes Aigosthena as a kome of Megara ( IG vii 1 . 19 ), so the city may have had a double status as both a kome and a polis , and in this case a dependent polis within the territory of Megara (Hansen ( 1995 ) 74 -75 ); alternatively, the city developed into a polis only in the Heltic period. The date of the impressive fortifications at Aigosthena is uncertain, but probably C4l-C3e ( PECS s.v.; Winter ( 1971 ) 142 n. 56 ); on the site, see Benson ( 1895 )."
225,Megara (Megareus),"Megaris, Korinthia, Sikyonia",,,2844,13676,"225 . Megara (Megareus) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 00 , long 23 . 20 . Size of territory: 4 . Type:A.The toponym is Μέγαρα , τά ( IG i³ 1353 (C5s); Hdt. 9 . 14 ). The ethnic is Μεγαρευacuteς (Hdt. 9 . 21 . 1 ; Thuc. 1 . 103 . 4 ; CID ii 4 . 1 . 6 ( 361 / 60 ); SGDI 3034 (C4 )). Megara is called a polis in the political sense by the C6m poet Theognis ( 53 -58 , etc.), in a late copy of a rC5 inscription ( IG vii 53 = Tod 20 . 15 ) and in CID ii 5 . i . 3 -4 , 6 ( 360 ). Thuc. 1 . 103 . 4 and Xen. Vect . 4 . 46 refer to Megara as a polis in the urban sense.The Aristotelian collection of politeiai included one of the Megarians (fr. 561 ). Thgn. 219 refers to his fellow Megarians as πολιητέων , but also as αστοῖσιν ( 24 ; cf. T od 20 . 13 ( c. 479 )). At Thgn. 788 , patre ( = patris ) is used about Megara, and at Dem. 18 . 291 -92 it is implicitly described as patris . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found in Tod 20 . 5 , 13 ( c. 479 ) and on C4 coins ( infra ) and in a C4l inscription: οasper δαtilde µ ος [ οasper Μ ] εγαρέων ( IG vii 1 . 12 , 17 ); the external collective use is attested on the Serpent Column (ML 27 . 4 ( 479 / 8 )) and in, e.g., Hdt. 9 . 21 . 1 and Thuc. 1 . 103 . 4 . The internal individual use of the city-ethnic may be found as early as Theognis' self-description: Θευacuteγνιδός . . . τουtilde Μεγαρέως ( 22 -23 ); the external individual use is attested in Hdt. 3 . 60 . 3 (rC6s), on a C4 gravestone ( Χαῖρις Θεγείτου Μεγα [ ρ ] ευacute [ ς ] ( SGDI 3034 , from Sparta)) and in CID ii 63 . 16 (C4m). The territory is called ταgrave Μέγαρα ( εγ Μεγάρω &lt; ν &gt;: IG I ³ 1353 (C5m); Thuc. 2 . 31 . 1 ) or ηasper Μεγαρίς (Hdt. 9 . 14 ; Thuc. 4 . 70 . 1 ) or ηasper Μεγαρική (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 18 ). It is called χώρα in Ps.-Skylax 39 . Megara was situated on the Isthmus of Corinth, bounded bythe Corinthian Gulf on the north,Mts.Kithairon,Pateras and Kerata on the east, separating Megarian territory from Attika and Boiotia, the Saronic Gulf on the south, and Mt. Gerania on the west, dividing Megaris and Corinthia. Legon ( 1981 ) 59 -70 argues that Krommyon, Mt. Gerania and the Perachora peninsula were controlled by Megara after the Dorian invasions and were taken by Corinth (no. 227 ) in the conflicts of C8 . Salmon ( 1984 ) 46 -48 places the transition at least a century earlier. The Dorians seem to have settled the Megarid in five komai : ' Ηραεῖς , Πιραεῖς , Μεγαρεῖς , Κυνοσουρεῖς and Τριποδίσκιοι (Plut. Quaest. Graec . 17 ; cf. Arist. Poet . 1448 a 30 ff; Legon ( 1981 ) 47 -55 ; Jones, POAG 94 -96 ). Another version of the early settlement pattern may be inferred from Strabo ( 9 . 1 . 10 ), where he reports that the Megarians interpolated a passage in Homer's Iliad linking Salamis with Polichna, Aigiroussa, Nisaia and Tripodes,to prove the pre-Dorian antiquity of their claim to Salamis.The implication is that the latter four places were all within Megarian territory. Rigsby ( 1987 ) 98 -102 argues that this couplet presents a more accurate picture of the Megarid in the Dark Ages than does Plutarch's testimony. Synoecism appears to have occurred in C8 through the union of five komai , including the kome of Megara (Plut. Quaest. Graec . 17 ; cf. Moggi, Sin . 29 -34 ). Attested place-names in the Megarid include Aigiros, perhaps in the region of Vathikhoria,based on the incident of the 'waggon-rollers' (Plut. Quaest. Graec . 59 ); Aigosthena (no. 224 ), in C4 a kome of Megara ( IG vii 1 . 19 ) and possibly a dependent polis of Megara as well ( supra ); Eirenea, a village (Paus. 7 . 22 . 8 ); Kynosoura,Archaic-Classical evidence is lacking, but a C3 inscription ( IG iv² . 1 42 ) refers to the hekatostyes of Kynosoura (see Legon ( 1981 ) 53 and nn. 23 and 32 ); Nisaia, the Saronic Gulf port of Megara (Thuc. 4 . 69 ; Paus. 1 . 39 . 4 ) associated with the island or promontory of Minoa (Thuc. 4 . 67 ; Paus. 1 . 44 . 3 ; Legon ( 1981 ) 29 -32 ); Pagai (no. 226 ) ( IG i³ 1353 . 5 (C5m)) was possibly a dependent polis of Megara by C4 ( infra ); Panormos, a harbour between Pagai and Aigosthena (Paus. 7 . 22 . 10 ); and Tripodiskos, tentatively identified in a central depression of Mt. Gerania, near the western edge of the Megarian plain (Thuc. 4 . 70 . 1 ; Paus. 1 . 43 . 8 ; Plut. Quaest. Graec . 17 ; Nicopoulou ( 1969 ), ( 1970 ); and Rigsby ( 1987 )). Megara's estimated peak population (C5 ) was 40 , 000 , including 15 , 000 slaves and free non-citizens (Legon ( 1981 ) 23 -24 , 167 -68 , 258 -59 , 268 -71 ). Megara is attested as a member of the Peloponnesian League in C5e (e.g. Thuc. 1 . 103 . 4 ), probably having accepted the obligatory bilateral alliance with Sparta (no. 345 ) in C6l at approximately the same time as Corinth (no. 227 ) (see Legon ( 1981 ) 143 -45 ). Megara broke away from the Peloponnesian League to become an ally of Athens (no. 361 ) in 461 , but returned to the League in 448 (Thuc. 1 . 103 . 3 -114 ; cf. Diod. 11 . 79 and 12 . 5 ). In C4 and beyond Megara frequently shifted allegiance and attempted to maintain neutrality among its larger neighbours and more distant powers (Legon ( 1981 ) 257 -79 , 285 -95 , 299 -303 ). Megara awarded proxenia to citizens of, e.g., Argos (no. 347 ) ( IG vii 2 (C4l)), and Megarian citizens were appointed proxenoi by Athens (no. 361 ) in C4f ( SEG 40 57 ) and by Delphi (no. 177 ) in 320 -310 ( F.Delphes iii . 1 161 ). A citizen of Megara served as Epidaurian theorodokos in 360 / 59 ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i a. 2 ). Megara mustered 3 , 000 hoplite troops at full mobilisation during the C5e battles of the Persian Wars (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 6 , 31 . 5 ), but less than half this number under similar circumstances in C4e (Legon ( 1981 ) 268 -71 , based on Diod. 15 . 31 and Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 11 -22 ). Six strategoi are attested in C4s ( IG vii 1 -7 ; cf. Heath ( 1912 -13 )). Naval power is attested for Megara as early as its C7l sea battle with Samos (no. 864 ) (Plut. Quaest. Graec . 57 ). Megara contributed twenty triremes to the Greek fleets at Artemision (Hdt. 8 . 1 . 1 ) and Salamis (Hdt. 8 . 45 ). The Megarians maintained that citizenship had been granted to only two non-Megarians: the hero Herakles and Alexander the Great (Plut. Mor . 826 C). The denial of citizenship to Hermon the metic is recorded by Dem. 23 . 212 , but see Paus. 10 . 9 . 4 . For Athenians living as metics in Megara, see also Dem. 29 . 3 ; Lycurg 1 . 21 ; Plut. Mor . 605 D. A casualty list of c. 425 -400 ( SEG 39 411 ) attests to a group of έποικοι (l. 22 ), i.e. free non-citizens. The existence of the three Dorian phylai at Classical Megara is attested by SEG 39 411 , a casualty list of c. 425 -400 listing the fallen soldiers under the rubrics Ηυλλ ˜ ες , etc. A hekatostys is attested in C3s ( IG iv² . 1 42 . 18 -21 ), but evidence from Megarian colonies ( infra ) suggests that such units existed at a much earlier date (Jones, POAG 94 ). Plut. Mor . 295 B reports the early existence of five komai ( ' Ηραεῖς , Πιραεῖς , Μεγαρεῖς , Κυνοσουρεῖς , Τριποδίσκιοι ) in Megaris, and one of these, Tripodiskos, is called a kome at Thuc. 4 . 70 . 1 as well. There is no compelling evidence that these komai functioned as civic subdivisions or as units of public organisation (Jones, POAG 95 -96 ; Hansen ( 1995 ) 72 -73 ), though it is worth noting that the C6 -C5 poet Sousarion refers to himself as a Μεγαρόυεν Τριποδίσκιος (fr. 1 , West). The Megarian constitution was oligarchic for most of the period between C7 and C5 , briefly interrupted by the tyranny of Theagenes in C7s (Thuc. 1 . 126 ; Arist. Pol . 1305 a , Rh . 1357 b ; Plut. Quaest. Graec . 18 ; Paus. 1 . 40 . 1 , 41 . 2 ) and by the 'unbridled democracy' in C6e (Arist. Pol . 1300 a 15 -19 , 1302 b 31 -32 , 1304 b 35 -40 ; Plut. Quaest. Graec . 18 and 59 ). Legon ( 1981 ) 105 -19 argues that much of the Theognidea , e.g. 43 -48 , 43 -60 and 182 -92 , also refers to the latter regime; cf. Robinson ( 1997 ) 114 -17 . A democratic faction seized power in 427 and had the leading oligarchs exiled.Renewed stasis in 424 , however, resulted in the Athenian conquest of Nisaia and the long walls, whereupon the Megarians opened their gates to the Lakedaimonians under Brasidas. A radical oligarchic constitution was introduced, and, of the leaders of the democratic faction, some went into exile while others were executed (Thuc. 3 . 68 . 3 , 4 . 66 -74 ; Gehrke, Stasis 106 -10 ). This oligarchy was still in power in C4e (Thuc. 4 . 74 . 3 , cf. 5 . 31 . 6 ; Dem. 18 . 96 ). Diod. 15 . 40 . 4 reports an attempted coup that was defeated by the demos in 375 , though it is more likely to have occurred in 369 after Leuktra (Legon ( 1981 ) 276 -78 ). C. 343 an attempt to introduce a pro-Makedonian faction into power was reported to Athens and thwarted by an Athenian relieving force under Phokion that fortified Nisaia and reconstructed Megara's long walls from the city to Nisaia (Dem. 19 . 294 -95 ; Plut. Phoc . 15 . 1 ; cf. Legon ( 1981 ) 289 -94 ). The institution of ostracism is reported by schol. Ar. Eq . 855 ( ωστρακοφόρουν . . . καιgrave Μεγαρεῖς ), a report now supported by the finding of an inscribed C5l-C4e ostrakon at Megara (Kritzas ( 1987 )). Decrees of C4l show that decisions were made by the boule and the demos in accordance with a probouleumatic procedure ( IG vii 1 -14 ; Rhodes, DGS 109 -12 ), but these decrees reflect the constitution after 307 . Other institutions known from C4 and later sources include a high court,'the three hundred' (Dem. 19 . 295 ), the aisymnatai ( IG vii 15 ), five demiourgoi in C4 ( IG vii 41 ) and five polemarchoi in C3 ( IG vii 27 -28 ). A basileus is attested as the eponymous official ( IG vii 1 -14 ); cf. a grammateus boulas kai demou ( IG vii 1 -14 ); a grammateus tou damou ( IG vii 29 ); and a grammateus ton synhedron ( IG vii 31 ). The town centres on the twin hills of Karia and Alkathoa, both under 300 m (Threpsiades and Travlos ( 1934 ) and ( 1936 ), which are encircled by a 3 . 5 km perimeter wall (of C4 ?) enclosing an area of 140 ha (Alexandris ( 1970 )). Long walls from the perimeter wall to the port of Nisaia, approximately 1 . 5 km distant, were built in C5m (Thuc. 1 . 103 . 4 ), destroyed in 424 / 3 (Thuc. 4 . 109 . 1 ), and briefly rebuilt in C4m (Plut. Phoc . 15 ); a section of the long walls has been uncovered; see P. Zoridis in ArchDelt 38 Chron. 1983 ( 1989 ) 39 -40 with plate 22 B; cf. AR ( 1990 -91 ) 12 . The site and main physical features of the town of Megara are well known.Excavations have identified the agora, stoas, major arteries and portions of the circuit wall (Threpsiades and Travlos ( 1936 )). The fountain house of Theagenes (C6 ) is Megara's most famous surviving monument (Gruben ( 1964 )). The divinities honoured include Apollo, Artemis, Athena, Demeter, Dionysos and Zeus (Paus. 1 . 39 -44 ; Hanell ( 1934 )). The principal divinity was Apollo Pythios (Paus. 1 . 42 . 5 ; Syll . ³ 653 . 22 (C2 ); Meyer ( 1931 ) 201 -2 ). On Alkathoa have been found the remains of a temple of Athena (Lauffer ( 1989 ) 415 ). Orsippos was victor at Olympia in 720 ( IG vii 52 ; Paus. 1 . 44 . 1 = Olympionikai 16 ; cf. nos. 23 , 48 , 49 , 468 ). A Megarian treasury was built at Olympia in C6l-C5e (Paus. 6 . 19 . 12 -14 ; Bol ( 1974 )) and one at Delphi in C5 -C4 (Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 126 -28 ). In C4l the trumpeter Herodoros of Megara won the prize in all the four major Panhellenic games, ten times according Ath. 414 F-415 A, seventeen times according to Poll. 4 . 89 -90 ); Ath. probably refers to the Olympia and Pythia,Poll. to the Isthmia and Nemea. From the time of the First Sacred War in C6e, Megara seems to have been frequently at odds with Delphi (no. 177 ) over the question of tolls levied on pilgrims to the sanctuary, and to have been involved in territorial disputes with its neighbours, Athens (no. 361 ) and Corinth (no. 227 ) (see Legon ( 1981 ) for details). The Megarians dedicated a statue of Apollo at Delphi in C5m for a victory over the Athenians at Nisaia (Paus. 10 . 15 . 1 ); cf. MEFR ( 1983 ) 631 , 1 . 1 . In C4m Megara contributed money to the rebuilding of Apollo's temple at Delphi after its collapse in 369 ( CID ii 4 . i . 6 , ii . 55 ( 360 )), and Megarians appear among the naopoioi ( CID ii 31 . 34 ( 354 / 3 , etc.)). Megara may have minted the disputed C6 'waggon wheel' coins (Head, HN ² 393 ), but its first authenticated coinage is dated to C4 : obv . head of Apollo; rev . Apollo's lyre. Legend: ΜΕΓΑΡΕ on the didrachm, ΜΕΓΑ and ΜΕΓ on smaller coins (Head, HN ² 329 -30 ; SNG Cop. AtticaAegina 459 -65 ). Megara was an active coloniser from C8s to C7m,founding Megara Hyblaia (no. 36 ), one of the earliest Sicilian colonies c. 750 (Thuc. 6 . 2 . 2 ; Strabo 5 . 270 -82 ; Hellan. fr. 82 ; cf. Vallet and Villard ( 1952 ) for discussion of literary and archaeological evidence). Megara also sent the oecist Pammilos for Selinous (no. 44 ) in Sicily in C7m (Thuc. 6 . 4 . 2 ), but concentrated its further colonising activities in the Hellespontine and Black Sea regions. Megara was principal or sole founder of Kalchedon (no. 743 ) c. 675 (Thuc. 4 . 75 . 2 ; Strabo 12 . 4 . 2 ; Pompon. 1 . 101 ), Selymbria (no. 679 ) c. 660 (Ps.-Skymnos 715 -16 ), Byzantion (no. 674 ) c. 658 (Hdt. 4 . 144 . 2 ; Hsch. Patria Constantinoupoleos 5 . 3 ), Astakos (no. 737 ) (Memnon ( FGrHist 434 ) fr. 12 ), Herakleia Pontike (no. 715 ) in C6m (Paus. 5 . 26 . 7 ) and possibly Olbia (no. 753 ). Since Megara was not a major factor in later Greek history, many of its early foundations were disputed in late sources. See Hanell ( 1934 ), esp. 161 -204 , for cult and calendar evidence that confirms Megarian influence in the colonies."
226,Pagai (Pagaios),"Megaris, Korinthia, Sikyonia",38.05,23.1,343,1668,"226 . Pagai (Pagaios) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 05 , long. 23 . 10 . Size of territory: probably 1 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Παγαί , αιasper ( IG i³ 1353 . 5 (C5m)) or Πηγαί , αιasper (Thuc. 1 . 111 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 39 ). The city-ethnic is Παγαῖος (C2 coins: Head, HN ² 417 ). Pagai was situated in Megaris, according to Hellan. fr. 44 and Ps.-Skylax 39 . In a difficult chapter (on which see Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 -43 ), Ps.-Skylax 39 (C4 ) refers to a plurality of poleis in Megaris by the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε , and among the toponyms which follow this heading Πηγαί is securely preserved; it is thus likely that Pagai is here listed as a polis in the urban sense. Several sources indicate that Pagai was a polis in the political sense in the Heltic period: it legislated ( IG vii 190 ), one of its citizens served as Delphic theorodokos ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) ii . 29 ( 230 -220 )), and it was a member of the Achaian Confederacy (Head, HN ² 417 ). That it may already have been a polis by C4 is suggested by Ps.-Skylax 39 . An inscription of c. 300 refers to a plurality of komai in Megaris ( IG VII 1 . 19 ); it seems likely that, like Aigosthena (no. 224 ), Pagai was one of these komai , and so the city may have had a double status as both a kome and a polis and in this case a dependent polis within the territory of Megara (Hansen ( 1995 ) 74 -75 ); alternatively, the city developed into a polis only in the Heltic period. An Archaic inscription suggests a cult of Apollo Lykeios ( IG vii 35 ). On the site are remains of undated walls (Hammond ( 1973 ) 438 -40 ). Thuc. 1 . 103 . 4 shows that Pagai was fortified in C5m. ## 2 . Corinthia"
227,Korinthos (Korinthios),"Megaris, Korinthia, Sikyonia",37.55,23.55,3735,17634,"227 . Korinthos (Korinthios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 55 , long. 23 . 55 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A. The toponym is Κόρινθος , ηasper (Anac. 195 , Gentili; Simon. fr. 40 , Page; Hdt. 3 . 50 . 3 ), also spelled /Koppaόρινθος (ML 24 = IG i³ 1143 ( 480 / 79 )). The cityethnic is Κορίνθιος ( IG iv 355 (C5e); Hdt. 1 . 23 ), also spelled /Koppaορίνθιος ( SEG 41 540 B. 1 (C6m); SEG 23 264 a. 3 ( 540 -525 )). Corinth is called a polis in the urban sense by Hdt. 8 . 61 . 2 and Thuc. 1 . 13 . 5 . The territorial sense is a connotation at Thuc. 1 . 13 . 5 (second occurrence). The political sense is attested in C6m (Thgn. 893 ) and later by Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 2 and CID ii 4 . ii . 35 and 58 . Aristotle also included Corinth in his collection of 158 politeiai (frr. 521 -22 ). The term asty is used for Corinth on a C5e gravestone found on Salamis (ML 24 = IG i³ 1143 ) and by Simon. fr. 10 , West. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C4 bronze coinage ( infra ), and externally in a C6 oracle reported by Hdt. 5 . 92 β 3 and on the Serpent Column (ML 27 . 2 ( 479 / 8 )). The external individual city-ethnic is attested, e.g. in SEG 41 540 B. 1 (C6m) and SEG 23 264 a. 3 ( 540 -525 ), in IG iv 355 (C5e) and in Thuc. 6 . 104 . 1 . Corinth is called patris in Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 6 ; Dem. 18 . 291 -92 , 20 . 52 -54 ; and CEG ii 720 (C4f; cf. SEG 27 298 , 30 579 (with a suggestion of a slightly earlier date)). The territory is called ηasper Κορινθία (Thuc. 4 . 42 . 1 , 45 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 8 ) or Κόρινθalternateος : Anakreon uses the phrase ευρυχόροιο Κορίνθalternateου (fr. 195 , Gentili). Estimated area was 900 km ² (Beloch ( 1922 ) 276 ), situated in the northeastern Peloponnese, and extending on to the Isthmus of Corinth (see Wiseman ( 1978 ) for a thorough survey). The boundary between Corinth and Megaris was Mt. Gerania. The peninsula of Perachora on the Isthmus passed into Corinthian control no later than C8l (Legon ( 1981 ) 67 -69 ). Salmon ( 1984 ) 46 -48 would place the transition at least a century earlier. On the east, the Corinthian coast was washed by the Saronic Gulf, in the north-west by the Corinthian Gulf. The river Nemea formed Corinth's western boundary with Sikyon (no. 228 ) (Strabo 8 . 6 . 25 ). The complexities of Corinth's southern boundaries with Kleonai (no. 351 ), Argos (no. 347 ) and Epidauros (no. 348 ) are discussed by Salmon ( 1984 ) 3 -6 . Horoi are recorded along the border between Corinth and Argos by Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 60 . No other poleis are recorded as having existed within Corinthian territory in the Archaic and Classical periods. Located settlements in the territory of Corinth (see Wiseman ( 1978 )) comprise Boukephalos ( Bucephalus : Plin. HN 4 . 18 ; Barr ., AC); Kromna ( Κρώ µ να : Lycoph. Alex . 522 with schol; Barr ., AC; cf. SEG 22 219 ( 325 -280 ), a sepulchral inscription over or a dedication by Αγάθων Κρω µ νίτης ); Krommyon ( Κρο µµ υών : Thuc. 4 . 45 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 55 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 13 , 19 , τεῖχος ; Strabo 8 . 6 . 22 ; Barr ., AC); Oinoe ( Οινόη : Xen. Hell . 4 . 5 . 19 ; Strabo 8 . 6 . 22 ; Barr . C); Schoinous ( Σχοινουtildeς : Strabo 8 . 6 . 4 , 22 ; λι µ ήν Barr ., AC); Sidous ( Σιδουtildeς : Ps.-Skylax 55 ; Xen.

Hell . 4 . 4 . 19 ; Strabo 8 . 6 . 22 , κώ µ η ; Paus. 2 . 5 . 4 ; Barr ., AC), which developed into a polis in the Heltic period (see SEG 13 348 (C1 ) and Head, HN ² 418 ); and Therme ( Θερ µ ά : Xen. Hell . 4 . 5 . 8 ; Barr ., AC); furthermore, Lechaion (Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 7 ; Pl. Menex . 245 E) and Kenchreai ( Κεγχρεία ( ι ): Thuc. 8 . 23 . 1 , 5 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 5 . 1 ), the two harbours of Corinth (Ps.-Skylax 40 , 55 ; Paus. 2 . 2 . 3 ; Strabo 8 . 6 . 22 ; Barr . AC). Note also that Hdt. 5 . 92 β 1 refers to a δηtilde µ ος called Πέτρη , and that Theopomp. fr. 173 refers to two κῶ µ αι µ εγάλαι καιgrave πολυάνθρωποι called Asai and Mausos; Asai is unlocated ( Barr .), whereas Barr . (following Wiseman ( 1978 ) 81 ) tentatively identifies Mausos with the C site at modern Mapsos. The estimated C5 population is 70 , 000 , including slaves and any non-citizens (Salmon ( 1984 ) 165 -69 ). The three Dorian phylai (Hylleis, Pamphyloi and Dymanes), are attested only indirectly, through their presence in Corinthian colonies (Salmon ( 1984 ) 57 ). In C6 , probably during the reign of the Kypselidai, the three Dorian phylai were replaced for political and military purposes by eight territorially defined phylai , in which districts of the various regions of the Corinthia were intentionally mixed by means of subdivisions designated as hemiogdoa and triakada (C2 decree found at Delos and reported by Robert ( 1948 ), ( 1960 ); cf. Jones ( 1980 ), POAG 97 -103 ). There is no compelling evidence that subordinate settlements ( supra ) functioned as units of public administration (Salmon ( 1984 ) 417 n. 18 ), though a sub-ethnic ( Κρω µ νίτης ( SEG 22 219 ( 325 -280 )) was presumably coined from the toponym of one of them. Corinth was among the most steadfast allies of Sparta (no. 345 ) and most active members of the Peloponnesian League throughout C5 (Salmon ( 1984 ) 240 -380 ). Corinth was probably allied to Sparta by C6m (ibid. 240 ff), some time before they jointly participated in the Samian expedition c. 525 / 4 (Hdt. 3 . 44 -46 ). Corinth's prominence in the Peloponnesian League is widely attested in Herodotos (e.g. 5 . 92 -93 ) and Thucydides (e.g. 1 . 67 -72 , 119 -25 . 1 ). In 421 Corinth was an equal party to an alliance with Mantinea (no. 281 ), Elis (no. 251 ), Chalkidike and Argos (no. 347 ) (Thuc. 5 . 27 ff), but did not repudiate the alliance with Sparta. In 395 Corinth broke away from Sparta and was instrumental in organising a series of bilateral alliances linking Corinth, Argos, Athens (no. 361 ) and Boiotia, but dissolved these arrangements and made a new alliance with Sparta at the time of the King's Peace (Diod. 14 . 82 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 17 , 5 . 1 . 36 ; Andoc. 3 . 22 ; cf. Salmon ( 1984 ) 348 ff). Corinth attempted to remain neutral in C4m (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 7 -10 ; Salmon ( 1984 ) 379 -82 , 427 -28 ), but joined Athens against Makedonia, probably without concluding a formal alliance (Dem. 18 . 237 ; Aeschin. 3 . 95 ; Strabo 9 . 2 . 37 ; cf. Salmon ( 1984 ) 383 ). Corinth was garrisoned by the Makedonians after Chaironeia (Polyb. 38 . 3 . 3 ; Ael. VH 6 . 1 ). The founding of Corinth was described in myth.Aletes is alleged to have consulted the oracle at Dodona,and received Zeus's blessing for a foundation at Corinth (Paus. 2 . 4 . 3 ; Pind. Ol . 13 . 14 ; Satyros P Oxy . 2465 fr. 3 . 2 12 -20 ). The proverb ' δέχεται καιgrave βῶλον Αλήτης '(Diogenian. 4 . 27 ; Zen. 3 . 22 ; Douris ( FGrHist 76 ) fr. 84 ) may be traced back to Eumelos (Salmon ( 1984 ) 38 ). Based on a king list (Diod. 7 . 9 ), however, Bacchis may have been the actual founder, c. 900 . Legend attributed the Corinthian synoecism to King Aletes at the time of the foundation. Salmon ( 1984 ) 57 -58 concludes that Corinthia was unified from the time of the Dorian conquest, c. 900 (Phot. Lexicon : πάντα όκτω ). During the Persian War Corinth mustered 5 , 000 hoplites at Plataiai in 479 (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 3 ) and forty triremes at Artemision and Salamis (Hdt. 8 . 1 , 43 ). In the Peloponnesian War Corinth sent 3 , 000 hoplites and thirty triremes to Leukimme (Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 ), ninety triremes to Sybota (Thuc. 1 . 46 . 1 ), forty triremes and 1 , 500 hoplites to restore the tyrant of Astakos (no. 116 ) (Thuc. 2 . 33 . 1 ), and 2 , 000 hoplites to Boiotia after Delion in 424 (Thuc. 4 . 100 . 1 ). Some 3 , 000 Corinthian hoplites fought at Nemea in 394 (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 17 ). Corinth appointed eight strategoi to command its forces, one per tribe (Thuc. 1 . 46 . 2 , 2 . 33 . 1 , 7 . 7 . 1 , 19 . 4 , 34 . 2 ). Salmon ( 1984 ) 232 -33 suggests that they 'acted as a college, without an overall commander' . Few diplomatic envoys are named in the sources,but Hdt. 5 . 93 . 1 (rC6l) describes Sokles as αποgrave Κορίνθalternateου πρεσβευacuteων , and Aineas, son of Okytos, and Euphamidas, son of Aristonymos,were signers of the Peloponnesian truce with Athens in 423 (Thuc. 4 . 119 . 2 ). Corinth awarded proxenia to citizens of Korkyra (no. 123 ) (Thuc. 3 . 70 . 1 ), and Corinthian citizens were appointed proxenoi by Karthaia (no. 492 ) ( IG xii 5 542 . 14 (C4m)) and Delphi (no. 177 ) ( F.Delphes iii . 1 178 -79 (C4l)). In 356 a theorodokos was appointed to host theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 95 . 2 ). Monarchy gave way to the Bacchiad aristocracy in C8m (Diod. 7 . 9 ; Salmon ( 1984 ) 55 -56 ). The tyranny of the Kypselids lasted from C7m to C6e (Arist. Pol . 1315 b 22 -26 ; Salmon ( 1984 ) 186 -230 ). Thereafter, an oligarchic constitution characterised Corinth throughout C6 , C5 and C4 , interrupted only by a brief period of democracy 392 -386 ( infra ) and the tyranny of Timophanes in 366 (Arist. Pol . 1306 a 21 -24 ). A Council of Eighty comprised of eight probouloi and seventy-two ordinary members (Nic. Dam. ( FGrHist 90 ) fr. 60 . 2 ; cf. Will ( 1955 ) 609 -15 ) existed by C4 and probably goes back to the time of the tyranny. This Council is probably the γερουσία mentioned by Diod. ( 16 . 65 . 6 , 9 ) as involved in the dispatch of Timoleon to Sicily in 346 / 5 (Salmon ( 1984 ) 231 ). Thuc. 5 . 30 . 5 mentions a Corinthian ξυacuteλλογος in 421 , which must be an assembly. Isopoliteia with Argos (no. 347 ) in C4e (Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 6 ; Diod. 14 . 92 . 1 ) led to joint administration of the Isthmian Games and some reciprocal political rights, but its further significance is disputed. Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 6 took it as a step toward the merger of the two poleis . Salmon ( 1984 ) 357 -71 disputes this interpretation. Corinthian exiles are attested at the time of these events: 150 of these exiles fought under the Spartan Praxitas to retake Corinth (Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 9 ). The isopoliteia was dissolved by the terms of the King's Peace (Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 32 -34 ). Salmon ( 1984 ) 354 -62 argues that even the revolution of 392 (Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 2 -5 ; Diod. 14 . 86 . 1 -2 ) did not overturn the oligarchy, but Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 6 supports the view of Kagan ( 1962 ) 447 -53 and Hamilton ( 1979 ) 260 -78 that a democratic regime came to power briefly. Corinth suffered threats and outbreaks of stasis during the tyranny of Periander (Hdt. 5 . 92 ζ -η ; Arist. Pol . 1284 a 26 -33 , 1311 a 20 -22 , 1313 a 36 -37 , b 21 -23 ), in connection with the overthrow of the tyranny (Nic. Dam. ( FGrHist 90 ) fr. 60 ), and in C4f during and after the Corinthian War: stasis between pro-Lakedaimonian and anti-Lakedaimonian factions broke out in 395 ( Hell. Oxy . 10 . 3 ), and the core of the pro-Lakedaimonian faction was massacred in 392 (Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 1 -5 ; cf. Buckler ( 1999 )). Later in 392 the Corinthian exiles and their allies conquered Lecheion and won a battle fought against the Corinthians in the city (Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 9 -11 ). The anti-Lakedaimonian democrats were expelled in turn after the King's Peace in 386 , when the proSpartan oligarchy had been restored (Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 34 ). Corinthian exiles are found in Argos (Diod. 15 . 40 . 3 ) and in Athens (Dem. 20 . 51 -57 ), and an attempted return in 375 ended in bloodshed (Diod. 15 . 40 . 3 ; for the date, see Stylianou ( 1998 ) 330 -31 ). Another stasis occurred in 366 / 5 , when Timophanes was appointed commander of a standing force of 400 mercenaries,but then set himself up as tyrant of Corinth, whereupon he was murdered by his brother Timoleon (Plut. Tim . 4 . 4 ; Arist. Pol . 1306 a 22 -24 ; Diod. 16 . 65 . 3 -8 ). The Akrokorinth was a 'natural fortress' (Salmon ( 1984 ) 220 ) and traces of what are most likely Archaic fortifications have been found there (Carpenter in Bon et al . ( 1936 ) 1 ff). Kypselos is credited with building the earliest fortifications around the city (rubble-filled stone with an average width of 2 . 4 m) and joining it to the Akrokorinth (A. N. Stillwell ( 1948 ) 14 ). Remains are dated to C7f (ibid.; Lang ( 1996 ) 171 ). The Classical city walls of Corinth were approximately 7 . 5 km in length, enclosing an urban area of 600 -700 ha (Carpenter in Bon et al . ( 1936 ) 1 -83 ). In C5m,long walls were built between Corinth and the port of Lechaion (Parsons in Bon et al . ( 1936 ) 84 -125 ). These were breached by Praxitas in 392 (Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 13 ). Public buildings included the bouleuterion (Diod. 16 . 65 . 6 (r 346 )), the Kyklopeian Springs constructed by the Bacchiads in C8 -C7 , the Sacred Spring, the springs of Glauke (Paus. 2 . 3 . 5 ) and Peirene (Paus. 2 . 3 . 3 ; cf. Salmon ( 1984 ) 78 -80 on the springs); and remains have been found of a stadion of C5f (Romano ( 1993 ) 43 ). Pausanias visited what remained of the Corinthian agora ( 2 . 2 . 5 -3 . 1 ); the north stoa was built in several stages in C5 ; the early stage of the north building consisted of a stoa and shops (R. Stillwell et al . ( 1941 ) 212 -28 ), the south stoa built in C4l (Broneer ( 1954 ) 1 . 4 and Williams ( 1980 ) 121 ), and a theatre (Paus. 2 . 3 . 6 ). The earliest theatre was built in C5l (R. Stillwell ( 1952 ) 131 -33 ; cf. TGR ii. 152 -55 ). Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 3 mentions a theatre in the context of Corinthian stasis in 392 . Among the temples and shrines observed by Pausanias were the shrine of Tyche ( 2 . 2 . 7 ), the temple of Aphrodite (Strabo 8 . 6 . 20 ), the temple of Athena of the Bridle, and the temple of Zeus Supreme ( 2 . 4 . 5 ). Pausanias omits mention of the temple of Apollo built under the tyranny in C6m,which superseded an earlier temple of Apollo built in C7 by the Bacchiads (Salmon ( 1984 ) 78 -79 , 180 ). At Isthmia, the Corinthians built a temple of Poseidon and a sanctuary of Kyklopes (Ps.-Skylax 55 ; Paus. 2 . 2 . 2 ). At Perachora, Kypselos built the temple and altar of Hera Akraia in C6 . Among the cults attested in Corinth are those associated with Aphrodite, Hera, Medea,Athena, Bellerophon,Apollo, Poseidon,Ephesian Artemis,Dionysos,Hermes,Zeus of the Underworld,Zeus the All-Highest,Demeter,Kore,the Fates, Necessity and Violence, Pelagian and Egyptian Isis, and Serapis. (See Odelberg ( 1896 ) and Will ( 1955 ) 81 -236 .) Corinth was custodian of the sanctuary at Isthmia and presided over the Isthmian Games (Thuc. 8 . 9 -10 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 5 . 1 -2 ; Paus. 2 . 2 . 2 ). Consultation of the oracle at Delphi by the Bacchiad regime (C6e) is recorded by Hdt. 5 . 92 β 3 . Corinthian victories are reported in the Olympic Games ( Olympionikai 13 , 14 , 147 , 152 , 154 , 229 , 249 -50 , 367 c), the Pythian Games (Pind. Ol . 13 . 37 ; Anth. Pal . 13 . 19 ), the Nemean Games (Pind. Ol . 13 . 44 ; Anth. Pal . 13 . 19 ), the Panathenaic Games ( Anth. Pal . 13 . 19 ), and, of course, the Isthmian Games (Pind. Ol . 13 . 41 ; Anth. Pal . 13 . 19 ). The earliest known treasury at Delphi was dedicated by the Corinthian tyrant Kypselos (Hdt. 1 . 14 . 2 ; Plut. Mor . 164 A, 400 D-E).He also dedicated a gold colossus at Olympia in C7m (Pl. Phdr . 236 B). The Olympieion allegedly built by Periander, near Corinth, was destroyed in C4e (Paus. 2 . 5 . 5 ). Corinth had one of the most prolific mints in ancient Greece (see Kraay ( 1976 ) 78 -88 ). C6f and later silver coins bore an image of Pegasos and the letter /Koppa on the obv ., and a helmeted Athena on the rev ., with Aphrodite substituted for Athena on drachms and smaller denominations. The Corinthian weight standard was adopted in much of northwest Greece. Minting ceased during the greater part of the Peloponnesian War in C5l and resumed in C4e (Kraay ( 1976 ) 85 -86 ). On C4 bronze coinage we find Κ , ΚΟΡ , and ΚΟΡΙΝΘΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² xlvii and 399 ff; SNG Cop. Corinth 1 -67 ). Corinth was involved in the colonisation of Syracuse (no. 47 ), oecist Archias (Thuc. 6 . 3 . 2 ); Apollonia (no. 77 ), which was either a Corinthian foundation (Thuc. 1 . 26 . 2 ; Plin. HN 3 . 145 ; Plut. Dio 41 . 45 . 1 ; Steph. Byz. 105 . 21 -22 ) or a joint foundation with Korkyra (Strabo 7 . 5 . 8 ; Ps.-Skymnos 439 -40 ); Elea (no. 95 ); possibly Alyzeia (no. 112 ); Ambrakia (no. 113 ), oecist Gorgos (Strabo 7 . 7 . 6 ; Ps.-Skymnos 453 -55 ; Thuc. 2 . 80 . 3 ); Anaktorion (no. 114 ) in C7l-C6e (Nic. Dam. ( FGrHist 90 ) fr. 57 . 7 ; Strabo 10 . 2 . 8 ); Plut. Mor . 552 E credits Periander with this foundation, but Anaktorion may have been jointly founded with Korkyra (Thuc. 1 . 55 . 1 ); possibly Astakos (no. 116 ); Korkyra (no. 123 ), oecist Chersikrates (Thuc. 1 . 26 ; Ap. Rhod. 4 . 1212 with schol.; Timaeus ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 80 ); Leukas (no. 126 ), founded by Kypselos (Hdt. 8 . 45 ; Thuc. 1 . 30 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 34 ); Sollion (no. 137 ); Chalkis (no. 145 ); Molykreion (no. 150 ); and Poteidaia (no. 598 ) in C6e, said to have been founded by Periander (Nic. Dam. ( FGrHist 90 ) fr. 59 . 1 ). Corinth maintained active relations with its colonies. Thus, a Corinthian, Phalios, son of Eratokleides, was oecist at the Korkyran colony of Epidamnos in C7lm (Thuc. 1 . 24 . 1 -2 ); in C5e, Corinth and Korkyra arbitrated between Syracuse and Hippokrates of Gela (Hdt. 7 . 154 . 3 ); as late as C5s, magistrates called επιδη µ ιουργοί were sent to Poteidaia (Thuc. 1 . 56 . 2 ), and in 346 / 5 Timoleon was sent to Syracuse on that city's own request to end the political chaos there (Diod. 16 -65 ; see Talbert ( 1974 )). See further Graham ( 1964 ) 118 -53 . ## 3 . Sikyonia"
228,Sikyon (Sikyonios),"Megaris, Korinthia, Sikyonia",38.0,22.45,2607,12392,"228 . Sikyon (Sikyonios) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 00 , long. 22 . 45 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Σικυών , οasper (Pind. Ol . 13 . 109 ; Thuc. 1 . 111 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 14 ) or ηasper (Pind. Nem . 9 . 53 ); in local script up to C4l, it appears as Σεκυών ( SEG 11 257 (C5f)). The ethnic is Σικυόνιος (ML 27 . 3 ( 479 / 8 )), Σικυώνιος ( IG v . 1 1565 = Tod 120 ; Hdt. 5 . 69 . 1 ), or Σεκυώνιος ( SGDI 3162 ; Griffin ( 1982 ) 62 ); Σε/KoppaυΓaltονιιος is found in LSAG 140 and pl. 23 (C7 ). In Classical sources Sikyon is called a polis in the political sense by Thuc. 8 . 3 . 2 and Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 44 ; the urban sense is found at Ps.-Skylax 41 , and asty appears in Xen. Hell . 7 . 3 . 4 and Theopomp. fr. 176 ; polis in the territorial sense is found in Xen. Hell . 7 . 3 . 3 ( οasperacuteλην . . . τηgraveν πόλις ). The term asty is used for Sikyon at Xen. Hell . 7 . 3 . 4 and Theopomp. fr. 176 and 311 . Xenophon refers to the politeia at Hell . 7 . 1 . 44 ( καταgrave τουgraveς αρχαίους νό µ ους ηasper πολιτεία ηtildeν ), and Aristotle included Sikyon in his collection of 158 politeiai (Arist. fr. 598 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found in IG iv 429 . 3 (C4s); the external collective use is attested in IvO 649 (C5f), on a C5m bronze greave dedicated at Olympia (Griffin ( 1982 ) 62 ; cf. SEG 31 369 ), and on the Serpent Column (ML 27 . 3 ( 479 / 8 )); the external individual use is found on a C7 graffito from Delphi: Σε/KoppaυΓaltονιιος ( LSAG 140 and pl. 23 ), in IG i³ 741 (C5e), on a C4f limestone base at Delphi: [ Κλ ] έων επόησε Σικυώνιος (Tod 120 ), and in the historians (e.g. Hdt. 5 . 69 . 1 ; Thuc. 7 . 19 . 4 ). Sikyon is called patra ( = patris ) in CEG ii 811 ( 356 ) and is implicitly called patris at Dem. 18 . 291 -92 (cf. IG ii² 448 . 55 -56 ( 318 / 7 )). The territory is called Σικυών (Hdt. 1 . 145 , 5 . 67 . 1 ; Thuc. 5 . 81 . 2 ) or Σικυωνία (Thuc. 4 . 101 . 3 ); it is called χώρη at Hdt. 5 . 67 . The size of the territory has been estimated at 360 -400 km ² (Beloch ( 1922 ) 276 ). Sikyon's eastern boundary was the river Nemea, which divided its territory from Corinthia (Strabo 8 . 6 . 25 ). Sikyon was bounded by the Corinthian Gulf on the north, and by the river Sythas and the territory of Pellene (no. 240 ) on the west (Paus. 7 . 27 . 12 ). In the south, Sikyon was separated from the territory of Phleious (no. 355 ) by mountains-Apesas, Spiria and Trikaranon (Skalet ( 1928 ) 28 ). The main area of occupation and the city of Sikyon were located in a triangular coastal plain bounded by the rivers Asopus and Helisson (Skalet ( 1928 ) 1 -4 ). Urban sites within Sikyonia included Titane, probably the most important site after Sikyon itself,but with little remaining (Paus. 2 . 11 . 3 ; Barr ., AC); Ephyra (Strabo 8 . 3 . 4 ; not in Barr .), Plataiai (Strabo 9 . 2 . 31 ; not in Barr .), Donoussa (Gonoussa; not in Barr .) (Paus. 5 . 18 . 7 , 7 . 26 . 6 ; Hom. Il . 2 . 573 ), and Phoibia (alias Bouphia: Steph. Byz. 184 . 5 = Ephor. fr. 81 ; not in Barr .) called a πόλισ µ α (town) by Paus. 9 . 15 . 2 . Forts identified in the sources are Epieikia (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 14 , 4 . 13 ); Derai (Gerai), a stronghold (Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 22 ); and Thyamia (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 1 , 23 , 4 . 1 . 11 ). The free population in C5 and C4 is estimated at 20 , 000 (Beloch ( 1922 ) 276 ). The three Dorian phylai -Hylleis, Pamphyloi and Dymanes-are attested, and an additional tribe, Aigialeis, established for the pre-Dorian population (Hdt. 5 . 68 ). These were abolished by the tyrant Kleisthenes, but restored after the fall of the tyranny in C6m (Hdt. 5 . 68 ). Sikyon was dominated by Argos (no. 347 ) until the period of the Sikyonian tyranny, when Kleisthenes (C6e) fought a war with Argos (Hdt. 5 . 67 -68 ). It was a member of the Peloponnesian League from C6l to 369 (the earliest notice of Sikyon's membership being in 494 , when it supplied ships to the Spartan king, Kleomenes: Hdt. 6 . 92 . 1 ). In the reorganisation of the Peloponnesian League in 377 , Sikyon was paired with Phleious (no. 355 ) and the communities of Akte in one of the ten divisions (Diod. 15 . 31 . 2 ). Sikyon was included as a subordinate party in the Athenian/Spartan alliance of 369 (Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 1 , 15 -23 , 2 . 2 ). After Sparta's defeat at Leuktra in the same year, Sikyonia was invaded by Epameinondas, conquered and forced to join the Theban alliance (Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 18 , 22 , 44 ; 2 . 2 , 3 . 2 ; Diod. 15 . 69 . 1 ). A Theban harmost is attested in Sikyon c. 366 (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 11 and 3 . 4 , 9 ). By the time of Alexander's death a Makedonian garrison held Sikyon ( IG ii² 448 ). An inscription from C4l records a treaty between Athens (no. 361 ) and Sikyon ( Staatsverträge no. 445 ). In 480 , Sikyon sent twelve ships to the Hellenic fleet at Artemision (Hdt. 8 . 1 . 2 ) and, later, fifteen to Salamis (Hdt. 8 . 43 ). In 479 , Sikyon mustered 3 , 000 hoplites at Plataiai (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 4 , 31 . 3 ). At Nemea, a century later, Sikyon mustered only 1 , 500 hoplites (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ). The tyrant Orthagoras was a general ( polemarchos ) according to P Oxy . 11 , 1365 , and Herodotos calls Perileos, the Sikyonian general who died at Mykale in 479 , strategos (Hdt. 9 . 103 . 1 ). In C4m Euphron asked the people of Sikyon to choose strategoi , which they did (Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 45 ). Few Sikyonian diplomats are named, but Damotimos, son of Naukrates, and Onesimos, son of Megakles, are recorded as signers of the one-year truce in 423 (Thuc. 4 . 119 . 2 ); cf. Thuc. 1 . 28 . 1 for Sikyonian presbeis . Αγαθalternateοκλεῖς Α µ ουacuteνταο was Sikyonian proxenos at Thespiai (no. 222 ) in Boiotia ( IG vii 1724 ); and three Sikyonian proxenoi are noted in Messenia in C4s or later (Paus. 4 . 14 ). Kleandros and Sokles were proxenoi and theorodokoi of the Pisatans (no. 262 ) c. 365 -363 ( Syll . ³ 171 ; Perlman ( 2000 ) 64 -65 , 175 ). There is no evidence of grants of citizenship by Sikyon, or of free non-citizens. A citizen of Sikyon was granted citizenship by Athens (no. 361 ) in 323 / 2 ( IG ii² 448 ), and another by Eretria (no. 370 ) in C4s ( Eretria xi 1 ). The Dorian aristocracy of C8 -C7 gave way to tyranny in C7m.Sikyon experienced a century of tyrannical rule (Arist. Pol . 1315 b ; Diod. 8 . 24 ; cf. Skalet ( 1928 ) 51 -62 and Griffin ( 1982 ) 40 -59 , esp. 43 -47 on chronology) under Orthagoras, Myron,Aristonymos, Isodemos, Kleisthenes and Aischines. The tyrant Kleisthenes reformed the tribal structure in C6f (Hdt. 5 . 67 -68 ; Jones, POAG 103 -6 ). After the overthrow of the tyranny of Aischines in C6m (Plut. De Herod. Mal . 21 ), probably through Spartan intervention, oligarchy prevailed in Sikyon through most of C6 , C5 and C4 . Fearing that Sikyon might go over to Argos, the Spartans intervened again in 417 to establish a more extreme oligarchic regime (Thuc. 5 . 81 . 2 ). We do not know how long this regime remained in power, but Sikyon is referred to as supporting Sparta several years later, during the Sicilian campaign, under compulsion (Thuc. 7 . 58 . 3 ). There was an unsuccessful revolution in Sikyon in 375 / 4 (Diod. 15 . 40 . 4 ; for the date, see Stylianou 1998 ) 330 -31 ), and the oligarchy survived a shift to the Theban alliance in 369 except for the brief democratic/tyrannical coup of Euphron in 367 (Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 44 -46 , 3 . 4 -12 ; Diod. 15 . 70 . 3 ; Plut. Arat . 53 ). Outbreaks of stasis occurred in C6m when the tyranny was abolished (Plut. Mor . 859 D), in 417 when a more narrow form of oligarchy was established (Thuc. 5 . 81 . 2 ), c. 375 when a coup failed, probably planned by a democratic faction (Diod 15 . 40 . 4 ), in 367 -366 when Euphron established a short-lived tyranny (Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 44 -46 , 2 . 11 -15 , 2 -12 ), and c. 340 when a proMacedonian group was headed by the 'traitors' Aristratos and Epichares (Dem. 18 . 48 , 295 ). Artemis was the chief goddess of Sikyon, and Apollo the most revered god. The presence of Athena Polias or Poliouchos is disputed (for: Odelberg ( 1896 ) 31 ; against: Hitzig-Blümner, Pausanias 1 . 2 , p. 537 ). SEG 11 257 . 6 (C5f) attests to athletic games at Sikyon (cf. Pind. Nem . 9 ). The Sikyonians consulted the Delphic oracle on several important occasions in rC6m (Parke and Wormell ( 1956 ) nos. 23 (cf. Diod. 8 . 24 and Plut. Mor . 553 A) and 28 ; Pliny, HN 36 . 9 ). Sikyonians are listed among the temple-builders ( naopoioi ) who restored the temple of Apollo at Delphi in C4m, e.g. Ξενότι µ ος Σικυώνιος ( CID ii 31 . 12 ( 356 / 5 )). A collective donation of money by Sikyon towards this purpose is recorded in CID ii 8 . ii . 9 (C4m). Tellis won the stadion at Olympia in 708 ( Olympionikai 20 ); Myron, the tyrant, was chariot victor in 648 (Paus. 6 . 19 . 2 ; Olympionikai 52 ), and Kleisthenes, his descendant, won the chariot race in 576 or 572 (Hdt. 6 . 126 . 2 ; Olympionikai 96 ). Pythokritos, son of Kallinikos, the fluteplayer,won six consecutive victories at the Pythian Games in C6 , and was honoured with a statue at Olympia (Paus. 6 . 14 . 9 -10 ). Boukelos won the boys' boxing some time between 412 and 360 (Paus. 6 . 13 . 7 ; Hyde ( 1921 ) 120 ; Olympionikai 360 ). Sostratos was most prolific of all, winning the pancratic contests at Isthmia, Nemea, Olympia ( Olympionikai 420 , 425 , 433 ) and Delphi (Paus. 6 . 4 . 2 ). Sikyon built a prominent treasury at Delphi (Paus. 10 . 11 . 1 ). Archaeology has established a C5s building, but older C6f foundations beneath may be remains of a Sikyonian treasury of Kleisthenes' time, though the traditional attribution of the building to Sikyon is uncertain (Griffin ( 1982 ) 106 -11 ). A treasury at Olympia was dedicated by the Sikyonian Olympic victor and tyrant 'Myron and the Sikyonian demos ' in C7m (Paus. 6 . 19 . 1 -6 ), but letter-form dating assigns the archaeological remains to C5f (Jeffery ( 1990 ) 143 -44 ). There may have been an earlier C7l structure (Herrman ( 1972 ) 99 -100 ). The town of Sikyon had a two-level acropolis. A C5 wall surrounded the city, and another wall protected the acropolis. The city walls enclosed an area of approximately 175 ha (this wall is mentioned in Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 14 ; Aen. Tact. 29 . 12 ; Diod. 11 . 88 . 2 (r 453 )). The agora is mentioned at Hdt. 5 . 67 . 1 . The harbour must have had its own fortifications (see Skalet ( 1928 ) 7 ). In C4l, the city was relocated by Demeterios Poliorketes: the outer city wall was demolished, the lower acropolis wall was strengthened ( 2 . 5 m thickness),and a new wall was built surrounding the upper acropolis. The urban population moved from the old city on the plain below the acropolis to what had been the lower acropolis (Diod. 20 . 102 ; Plut. Demetr . 25 ; Strabo 8 . 6 . 25 ; Paus. 2 . 7 . 1 ; cf. Skalet ( 1928 ) 2 -3 ; Griffin ( 1982 ) 23 -24 , 78 ). The remains of public buildings in the city and on the acropolis are surveyed by Griffin ( 1982 ) 6 -24 . Most of the visible ruins date from Heltic and Roman times, including a theatre on the slope of the acropolis ( TGR ii. 291 -92 ; cf. Paus. 2 . 7 . 5 ; cf. Polyb. 29 . 24 . 6 and 25 . 2 ); but there is an Archaic temple rebuilt in the Heltic period. Paus. 2 . 9 . 6 mentiones a bouleuterion in the agora and a stoa ascribed to Kleisthenes, the C6 tyrant who also had a part of the prytaneion turned into a sanctuary for Melanippos (Hdt. 5 . 67 ). The C4l remains of a quadrangular hypostyle hall on the east side of the agora are usually identified with the bouleuterion referred to by Pausanias (Gneisz ( 1990 ) 351 -52 ). Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 45 describes a gathering of the demos in the agora in 367 -366 . Pausanias describes ( 2 . 11 . 1 -2 ) the remains of older temples on the original acropolis, whose precise location is still in dispute (Griffin ( 1982 ) 21 -24 ). These sacred buildings include the temple of Athena, the sanctuaries of Artemis and Apollo, Hera, and Demeter, and the shrines of Karneian Apollo and Hera Prodromia. The earliest Sikyonian coinage dated to C6l. Sikyon used the Aiginetan weight standard (Kraay ( 1976 ) 329 ). C5silver coinage had types: obv . Chimaera, or Apollo kneeling with his bow and arrows; rev . dove (a symbol of Artemis) and the letter Σ . C4e coinage with legend ΣΕ or ΣΙ . See Head, HN ² 409 -12 and SNG Cop.

229,Aigai (Aigaios),Achaia,38.2,22.2,699,3530,"229 . Aigai (Aigaios) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 20 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: [A]. The precise location of Aigai, which Paus. 7 . 27 . 12 situates close to the river Krathis, is uncertain, although it should probably be sought at either modern Akrata (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 174 ; Barr .) or Kokinies near the village of Ambelos (Rizakis ( 1995 ) 214 ). The toponym is normally Αιγαί (Hom. Il . 8 . 203 ; Hdt. 1 . 145 ; Ps.-Skylax 42 ), αιasper (Strabo 8 . 7 . 4 ), though Αιγά , ηasper is also attested ( IG ii² 8404 (C4 -C3e); Strabo 8 . 7 . 5 ). The city-ethnic is Αιγαῖος (Classical coins ( infra ); Strabo 8 . 7 . 4 ). The only Classical source to call Aigai a polis is Ps.-Skylax at 42 , where Αιγαί is the third toponym listed after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense. However, the appearance of coinage c. 500 should probably be seen as a strong indication that Aigai was already a polis in the political sense by this date (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 174 , though see Martin ( 1995 )). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested on coins from c. 500 onwards. The toponym is already attested in Hom. Il. 8 . 203 , and Hdt 1 . 145 (C5s) records Aigai as one of the original twelve Achaian mere -a term that is often used synonymously with chora in Achaian contexts, but need not necessarily imply the existence of an urban centre (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 168 -69 ). According to Paus. 7 . 25 . 12 and 8 . 15 . 9 , Aigai was abandoned due to 'weakness' , and its inhabitants incorporated within the polis of Aigeira (no. 230 ), where they were nevertheless permitted to retain their own ethnic (Strabo 8 . 7 . 4 ). The date at which this happened is not easy to determine: a terminus post quem may be provided by Aigai's inclusion in Ps.-Skylax's list of Achaian poleis ( 42 )-a section which should probably be dated to the years around 370 (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 167 ), and it may not be coincidental that coinage issues cease at about the same time (Head, HN ² 412 ). Aigai is omitted from Polybios' list of Achaian poleis ( 2 . 41 . 7 -8 ), which purports to describe the Achaian Confederacy prior to the time of Philip II and Alexander.On the other hand, IG ii² 8404 (C4 -C3e) commemorates a man who is described as an Αχαιοgraveς εξ Αιγαtildeς , which might suggest that Aigai had not yet been abandoned by the beginning of C3 if indeed the inscription is C3e. There is no explicit literary testimony for any colonial foundations originating from Aigai, but the homonymy between the river Krathis near Aigai and the river Krathis in the territory of Sybaris (no. 70 ) in South Italy has sometimes been taken to imply that some of the founders of Sybaris originated from the region of Aigai (Dunbabin ( 1948 ) 24 ; Bérard ( 1957 ) 141 ; Koerner ( 1974 ) 464 ; Giangiulio ( 1989 ) 166 -67 ). Aigai struck silver coins from c. 500 to c. 370 (Head, HN ² 412 ). Minted on the Aiginetan standard and including triobols and obols, this coinage had previously been assigned to Aigion (no. 231 ) by both Imhoof-Blumer ( 1883 ) 157 and Jeffery ( 1990 ) 222 , though the original attribution to Aigai has recently been defended by Rizakis ( 1995 ) no. 530 and Kroll ( 1996 ) 52 n. 14 . The obv . is a punning type depicting the forepart of a goat and accompanied by the legend AIG; the rev . depicts the ivy-crowned head of a bearded Dionysos and has the legend ΑΙΓΑΙΟΝ or ΑΙΓΑΙΩΝ (Rizakis ( 1995 ) no. 530 ; SNG Cop. Phliasia-Laconia 125 -26 )."
230,Aigeira (Aigeirates),Achaia,38.1,22.2,777,3871,"230 . Aigeira (Aigeirates) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 10 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. Aigeira, which ancient authors situated on a steep hill (Polyb. 4 . 57 . 5 ; Strabo 8 . 7 . 5 ), is located east of modern Krathio (Rizakis ( 1995 ) 215 -16 ; Barr .) The toponym is Αίγειρα , ηasper (Hdt. 1 . 145 ; Ps.-Skylax 42 ; Polyb. 2 . 41 . 8 ; Paus. 7 . 26 . 4 ), though Αίγιρα is attested in BCH 22 ( 1898 ) 261 n. 1 ( 325 (cf. BCH 62 ( 1938 ) 340 -41 )) and IG xii . 9 1187 . 34 (C3 ). The city-ethnic is regularly Αιγειράτης from C4 onwards ( infra ). Classified by Hdt 1 . 145 as one of the original twelve Achaian mere , it is listed by Ps.-Skylax 42 as the second toponym after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense; Theophr. Phys. op. 12 . 122 also uses polis in the urban sense, and the internal use of the collective city-ethnic on coinage from c. 330 ( infra ) would indicate that Aigeira was by this period also a polis in the political sense; Polyb. 2 . 41 . 7 -8 (rC4 ) calls it a polis in the political sense and attests to its membership of the Achaian Confederacy prior to the time of Philip II and Alexander. A citizen of Aigeira was appointed proxenos by Delphi (no. 177 ) in 325 ( Αχαιοgraveς εξ Αιγίρας : BCH 22 ( 1898 ) 261 n. 1 with BCH 62 ( 1938 ) 340 -41 ). Paus. 7 . 26 . 2 says that Aigeira was formerly called ' Υπερησία -a name known from Hom. Il. 2 . 573 -though he seems to date this shift in nomenclature to the period of the Ionian settlement of Achaia (i.e. the Heroic Age). It is therefore surprising that he should attach the ethnic Hyperesieus to an athlete from Aigeira named Ikaros who won the stade in 688 (Paus. 4 . 15 . 1 ; Olympionikai 28 ). The term could be archaising, or it could indicate a period prior to the synoecism of Aigeira (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 173 ). Such a synoecism is not explicitly attested by any source, though is perhaps suggested by the existence of a homonymous port ( επίνειον ) of Aigeira some two and a half miles from the acropolis (Paus. 7 . 26 . 1 ). It may be that the name Hyperesia was originally applied to the acropolis areaknown in later periods as the άκρα (Polyb. 4 . 58 . 4 ) or the άνω πόλιν (Paus. 7 . 26 . 1 ) and almost certainly to be associated with the plateau excavated since 1972 by the Austrian Archaeological Institute (see Alzinger ( 1972 -73 ), ( 1976 -77 ), ( 1981 -82 ), ( 1983 ), ( 1985 ), ( 1986 ); Bammer (forthcoming))but that after synoecism the επίνειον of Aigeira gave its name to the whole polis (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 173 ). The population of Aigeira expanded again when the polis incorporated the inhabitants of Aigai (Strabo 8 . 7 . 4 ). The date at which this happened is not easy to determine (cf. Aigai (no. 229 )). The archaeological evidence from the acropolis shows settlement dating back more or less continuously to the Neolithic period. Reappraisal of evidence from the acropolis has cast doubt upon the interpretation of foundations dating to C7s as those of a temple which Paus. 7 . 26 . 5 assigns to Artemis and Iphigeneia, and also upon the identification of an earlier C8structure as a temple (Bammer (forthcoming), contra Gogos ( 1986 ); Alzinger ( 1982 ) 13 -18 , ( 1985 ) 426 -30 , 449 -50 ). This evidence is more likely to relate to continuous settlement.Walls are certainly attested at Aigeira by C2 (Polyb. 4 . 57 . 3 , 58 . 7 ), and their circuit-encompassing a separately acropolis wall enclosing 3 . 5 ha-has been traced on the ground (Alzinger ( 1985 ) 392 ); recent investigations suggest that city walls existed prior to Heltic times ( AR ( 2001 -2 ) 36 ). Aigeira began minting bronze coins c. C4m: obv . helmeted Athena or veiled female head; rev . forepart of a goat or standing goat in a wreath. Legends: ΑΙΓΙ or ΑΙΓΙΡΑΤΑΝ (Head, HN ² 412 ; SNG Cop. Phliasia-Laconia 127 )."
231,Aigion (Aigieus),Achaia,38.15,22.05,777,3867,"231 . Aigion (Aigieus) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 15 , long. 22 . 05 . Size of territory: 2 or 3 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Αίγιον , τό (Hom. Il . 2 . 574 ; Hdt. 1 . 145 ; Ps.-Skylax 42 ). The city-ethnic is usually Αιγιευacuteς ( SEG 40 54 ( 399 / 8 ); Diod. 19 . 66 . 3 ; Strabo 8 . 7 . 5 ) but IG ii² 7946 ( c. 400 ) has Αιγαιευacuteς . Located at modern Egio ( Barr .), Aigion was one of the original twelve Achaian mere (Hdt. 1 . 145 ). It is first described as a polis in the urban sense in Ps.-Skylax 42 , where it is listed as the fourth toponym after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε ; Polyb. 2 . 41 . 7 -8 (rC4 ) calls it a polis in the political sense, and attests to its membership of the Achaian Confederacy prior to the time of Philip II and Alexander. The external collective use of the city-ethnic ( Αιγιέες ) is attested in a supposedly C7 Delphic oracle cited by Ion of Chios ( apudAnth.Pal . 14 . 73 ; Zenob. 1 . 57 ), but it is debatable whether Aigion's status as a polis in the political sense can really be retrojected as far back as C7 -the date supposedly attributed to this apocryphal and much-cited Delphic consultation. The external collective use of the city-ethnic is attested in Diod. 19 . 66 . 3 (r 313 ). The external individual use of the city-ethnic is found in an Athenian proxeny decree of 399 / 8 for Αριστέας οasper Αχαιοgraveς οasper Αιγιευacuteς ( SEG 40 54 ); cf. IG ii² 7946 ( c. 400 , epitaph). Strabo says that Aigion was synoecised from seven or eight demoi ( 8 . 3 . 2 ; Moggi, Sin . 125 -27 ), but although a number of rural sites appear in the archaeological record (see Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 177 ), we are poorly informed as to their ancient names. Rescue excavations are beginning to yield a clearer picture of the urbanisation of Aigion (Papakosta ( 1991 )). The evidence of Polyb. 11 . 9 . 8 reveals that a bouleuterion -probably housing meetings of the Achaian Confederacy (Walbank ( 1967 ) 280 ; Hansen and Fischer-Hansen ( 1994 ) 38 )-was in existence by C3 at least, while Pausanias' description ( 3 . 12 . 7 , 7 . 24 . 1 ) of the mnema of Talthybios in the agora of Aigion ought to suggest that the agora already existed by the late Classical period. Diod. 19 . 66 . 3 suggests that the city was fortified by C4l and mentions private houses within the circuit. The sanctuary of Zeus Homarios, which belonged to Aigion, although it lay outside the city (Aymard ( 1935 )), was certainly in existence by 280 , when the koinon of the Achaians met there (Strabo 8 . 7 . 3 ). It is not entirely certain, however, that it had always served as a common meeting place for the Achaians. The fact that the issue of the earliest Achaian federal coinage, depicting the head of Zeus, cannot be pushed back further than the 360 s may suggest that the sanctuary of Poseidon at Helike (no. 235 ) had formerly been a place of union for the Achaians and that this function was transferred to the Homarion after the destruction of Helike in 373 (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 196 , but see Walbank ( 2000 )). From C5 , an inscribed bronze oinochoe provides evidence for a sanctuary of Aigeus, although it is not known whether this signifies the hero or is a cult epithet for Poseidon (Robinson ( 1942 ); Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 177 ). Xenophon of Aigion was victorious in the pankration at the Olympic Games of 380 (Paus. 6 . 3 . 13 ; Olympionikai 400 ). A series of silver triobols, struck on the Aiginetan standard, was formerly assigned to Aigion (Imhoof-Blumer ( 1883 ) 157 ; Jeffery ( 1990 ) 222 ), but is now attributed to Aigai (no. 229 ) (Rizakis ( 1995 ) no. 530 ; Kroll ( 1996 ) 52 n. 14 ). According to Paus. 6 . 3 . 12 , Kaulonia (no. 55 ) in South Italy was colonised by Typhon of Aigion, though this receives no other literary support (Anderson ( 1954 ) 78 ; Koerner ( 1974 ) 464 ; Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 208 -9 )."
232,Ascheion (Ascheieus),Achaia,,,130,609,"232 . Ascheion (Ascheieus) Unlocated. Type: B. The toponym is Αacuteσχεον , τό ( CID ii 51 . 8 ( 339 / 8 )) or Αacuteσχειον ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) ii . 63 ( 230 -220 )). The city-ethnic is Ασχειευacuteς ( F.Delphes iii . 1 413 (C4s)) or Ασχευacuteς ( SEG 1 74 ( 229 / 8 )). Ascheion is never identified explicitly as a polis , though a Delphic decree granting proxenia to two of its citizens ( F.Delphes iii . 1 413 (C4s)) suggests that it was a polis in C4 ; there may also be some retrospective value in the fact that two men of Ascheion are listed as Delphic theorodokoi in BCH 45 ( 1921 ) ii . 63 ( 230 -220 )."
233,Boura (Bourios),Achaia,38.1,22.15,616,2982,"233 . Boura (Bourios) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 10 , long. 22 . 15 . Size of territory: 2 or 3 . Type: A. Situated near Keryneia (no. 236 ) by Paus. 7 . 25 . 8 and 40 stades from the sea by Strabo 8 . 7 . 5 , Boura should probably be located either near Ano Diakophto (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 175 ; Barr .) or on the left bank of the river Bouraïkos near Ag. Stephanos (Rizakis ( 1995 ) 209 -10 ). The toponym is Βουtildeρα , ηasper (Aesch. fr. 745 a, Mette; Hdt. 1 . 145 ; Polyb. 2 . 41 . 8 ). The city-ethnic is usually Βουacuteριος (Polyb. 2 . 41 . 13 ; SEG 1 74 ( 229 / 8 ), 12 1122 (C3 )), though Βουραῖος (Tzetz. Chil . 37 . 179 (rC4s)) and Βουρευacuteς (Paus. 7 . 25 . 8 -9 (r 373 )) are also found. Classified by Hdt 1 . 145 as a meros , it is called a polis in the urban sense by Theophr. Phys. op . 12 . 122 (r 373 ), and retrospective evidence is furnished by Polyb. 2 . 41 . 7 -8 (rC4 ), who uses polis in the political sense and attests to its membership of the Achaian Confederacy in the time prior to Philip II and Alexander, and by Diod. 15 . 48 . 3 (r 373 ), who uses the term in its urban sense. The external collective use of the city-ethnic is attested at Paus. 7 . 25 . 8 -9 (r 373 ); the external individual use is found at Tzetz. Chil . 37 . 179 (rC4s). Boura was affected severely by the earthquake of 373 which destroyed Helike (no. 235 ) (Paus. 7 . 25 . 8 -9 ), and is absent from the list of Achaian poleis in Ps.-Skylax 42 (C4f). Pausanias' comment ( 7 . 25 . 8 -9 ) that Boura was swiftly refounded by inhabitants who had been away on military service during the earthquake may find some confirmation in the archaeological record from Kastro (if, indeed, Kastro is to be identified with ancient Boura; see supra ) which appears to indicate virtual continuity from the late Archaic/early Classical period through until Roman times (Lauffer ( 1989 ) 160 ; Rizakis ( 1995 ) 209 -12 ; Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 175 ). If so, then Ovid's assertion ( Met . 15 . 293 -95 ) that a city named Buris was under water by his own day is either mistaken or indicates that Buris should not be identified with Boura. That Boura was a polis after its refoundation is virtually certain, since in C3 the collective city-ethnic is used internally ( SEG 1 1122 ), while the external use of the cityethnic for an individual is also attested ( SEG 1 74 ( 229 / 8 )); cf. also Tzetz. Chil . 37 . 179 (rC4s). Similarly, in C3m a citizen of Boura named Archedamos was granted proxenia by Thermon ( IG ix 1 . 1² 12 e); cf. also Polyb. 2 . 41 . 7 -8 . That Boura was a polis prior to its destruction is impossible to prove, although it is highly likely. There is no explicit testimony that Boura engaged in any colonial ventures to South Italy, though this is sometimes assumed on the basis of the homonymy between the river Sybaris in Sybarite territory and the Sybaris spring near Boura (Dunbabin ( 1948 ) 24 ; Bérard ( 1957 ) 141 ; Koerner ( 1974 ) 464 ; Giangiulio ( 1989 ) 166 -67 )."
234,Dyme (Dymaios),Achaia,38.1,21.35,1046,5263,"234 . Dyme (Dymaios) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 10 , long. 21 . 35 . Size of territory:? Type: [A]. Paus. 7 . 17 . 5 locates Dyme near the river Larisos, marking the border between Achaia and Elis, which has led to its being associated with modern Kato Achaia (Rizakis ( 1995 ) 156 ; Barr .). The toponym is normally ∆υacute µ η , ηasper (Hdt 1 . 145 ; Thuc. 2 . 84 . 5 ; Ephor. fr. 84 ; Ps.-Skylax 42 ), though ∆υacute µ α ( IdiCos ED 232 . 14 (C2 )), ∆υacute µ αι (Plut. Cleom . 14 . 4 ) and ∆υ µ αῖαι ( Etym. Magn. 291 . 12 -16 ) are also attested. The city-ethnic is ∆υ µ αῖος (Ephor. fr. 84 ; SEG 14 375 (C4l)). Hdt. 1 . 145 lists it among the original twelve mere of Achaia, but the only Classical source to call it a polis in the urban sense is Ps.-Skylax 42 , where it is listed as the seventh toponym after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε ; Polyb. 2 . 41 . 7 -8 (rC4 ) calls it a polis in the political sense, and attests to its membership of the Achaian Confederacy prior to the time of Philip II and Alexander (cf. SEG 14 375 (C4l)). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found abbreviated on C4m coins ( infra ); the external collective use is found in Ephor. fr. 84 ; the external individual use is found in Theopomp.fr. 194 and probably in SEG 14 375 (C4l). Strabo says that Dyme was synoecised from eight demoi ( 8 . 3 . 2 ; Moggi, Sin . 121 -25 ), and there are other indications in generally late sources that the toponym was adopted relatively late. Thus Paus. 7 . 17 . 5 says that Dyme's original name was Paleia, while Steph. Byz. (s.v. ∆υacute µ η ) say that its original name was Stratos; Strabo 8 . 7 . 5 compromises by hypothesising that Dyme was originally called Paleia and then Stratos. ² It is possible that Paleia and Stratos were the names of two of the demoi that were synoecised, along with the πολίχνη of Teuthea (Strabo 8 . 3 . 11 ; Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 186 -87 ). Determining the date of this synoecism is not easy: the toponym Paleia is attested as the πατρίς of an athlete named Oibotas on the base of a dedication referring to an Olympic victory in 756 but erected in 460 (Paus. 7 . 17 . 7 , cf. 6 . 3 . 8 ; Olympionikai 6 ), though the name of Dyme appears to be familiar already to Hecat. fr. 121 ( c. 500 ). Koerner ( 1974 ) 469 argues that Dyme must have been synoecised prior to 496 , the year in which Pataikos of Dyme won the trotting race at Olympia (Paus. 5 . 9 . 1 ; Olympionikai 171 ), though Pausanias does not attach the city-ethnic to Pataikos' name but merely says that he was an Achaian from Dyme. Demand ( 1990 ) 61 -64 suggests that the synoecism that Strabo imagines must have involved the incorporation of Olenos (no. 238 )-an event that would have to postdate Hdt. 1 . 145 . On the other hand, the city-ethnic, which is certainly used on coinage dating to C4m ( infra ), is already attached to Oibotas' name on the retrospective victory dedication mentioned above. This should indicate that Dyme was a synoecised polis by 460 . At this point, the demoi may have been reorganised within the three phylai of Stratis (or Spatis), Dymaia and Thesmiaia, which are attested in C3 ( Syll. ³ 531 , with Jones, POAG 130 -32 ). By C3 , an eponymous magistrate named the theokolos is attested (Sherk ( 1990 ) 258 ), though there is no way of determining the antiquity of this office. ² The phrase καιgrave έτι πρότερον Πάλ [ ι ] εια , οasperacuteτι άρ ' ενΩsubiotaώκησαν &lt; εν &gt; τοῖς Παλ &lt; ε &gt; ειώταις does not appear in all manuscripts. It is included in the Budé edition but omitted from the Loeb. A late tradition told of a war between Dyme and Elis (no. 251 ) in 668 (Euseb. Chron . 1 . 28 ; Philostr. Gymn . 7 ), though this provides no explicit indications of Dyme's status in the Archaic period. In 367 , it was 'liberated' along with Naupaktos (no. 165 ) and Kalydon (no. 148 ) by Epameinondas of Thebes (Diod. 15 . 75 . 2 ). According to Steph. Byz. (s.v. ∆υacute µ η ), the original name of the chora was ∆υacute µ η , while for Polyb. 2 . 51 . 3 and Paus. 7 . 17 . 3 it was ∆υ µ αία . The chora included the polichne of Teuthea (Strabo 8 . 3 . 11 ) and the phrourion of Teichos (Polyb. 4 . 59 . 4 ). The archaeological evidence suggests a dispersed settlement pattern until well into the Classical period (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 189 ), with the foundations of a small Archaic temple being found at Santameri, in the south of the territory of Dyme ( ArchDelt 22 B ( 1967 ) 216 ), and Classical elements-possibly to be associated with the temple of Athena Larisaia (Paus. 7 . 17 )-being found to the south-west, at Katarchia. An urban centre is attested c. 400 by Antimachos of Kolophon ( apud Steph. Byz. s.v. ∆υacute µ η ), who refers to ∆υacute µ ιον άστυ , though archaeological evidence suggests the existence of settlement in the area of the later centre already from the Archaic period (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 187 ). In 496 , Pataikos of Dyme won the trotting race at Olympia ( Olympionikai 171 ). On Oibotas of Paleia,see supra 473 -74 .

235,Helike (Helikeus),Achaia,38.15,22.1,692,3301,"235 . Helike (Helikeus) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 15 , long. 22 . 10 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. Paus. 7 . 24 . 5 locates Helike 40 stades from Aigion (no. 231 ), while Strabo 8 . 7 . 2 (following Herakleides) places it 12 stades from the sea. This should put it between the rivers Selinous and Kerynitis (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 175 ; Barr .). The city, which was overwhelmed by a tidal wave occasioned by an earthquake in 373 (Diod. 15 . 48 . 1 -49 . 4 ; Polyb. 2 . 41 . 7 ; Strabo 8 . 7 . 2 ; Paus. 7 . 24 . 6 ; Ael. NA 11 . 19 ), was normally supposed to lie under water (cf. Ov. Met . 15 . 293 -95 ), but sonar investigation suggests that it may actually lie inland under massive sedimentary deposits in the vicinity of Nea Keryneia (Petropoulos ( 1983 ); cf. Ptol. Geog . 3 . 14 . 36 , who lists Helike among the inland cities of Achaia). However, Rizakis ( 1995 ) 203 -4 finds all candidates for ancient Helike unconvincing. The toponym is usually ' Ελίκη , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 575 ; SEG 36 718 (C5e); Hdt. 1 . 145 ) or ' Ελίκα ( Syll . ³ 90 . 12 ), though Theophr. Phys. Op. 12 . 122 cites a verse which gives the toponym as ' Ελίκεια . The cityethnic is ' Ελικευacuteς (Diod. 15 . 49 . 3 ). Helike is called a polis in the urban sense in Heraclid. Pont.fr. 46 a (r 373 ) and Theophr. Phys. op . 12 . 122 (r 373 ), but is absent from Ps.-Skylax's list of Achaian poleis ( 42 ), which may suggest that this chapter was composed after 373 . Retrospective evidence is provided by Polyb. 2 . 41 . 7 (rC4 ), who calls it a polis in the political sense, and by Diod. 15 . 48 . 3 (r 373 ), who describes it as a polis in the urban sense. The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is probably found (abbreviated) on C4 coins ( infra ), and the external collective use is found in Diod. 15 . 49 . 3 (r ante 373 ). A citizen of Helike served as Delphic theorodokos in C5l ( Syll . ³ 90 . 12 ).According to Polyb. 2 . 41 . 6 -7 (rC4 ), Helike had been a member of the Achaian Confederacy. The early physical existence of Helike is attested in Hom. Il . 2 . 575 and in a C5e inscription ( SEG 36 718 ; see also Soter and Katsonopoulou ( 1999 )). Archaeological investigations have revealed the foundations of two small temples, one Archaic, the other Classical, at Nea Keryneia, which may possibly be associated with the acropolis of ancient Helike (Petropoulos ( 1990 )). The most important sanctuary at Helike was, however, that of Poseidon Helikonios (Hom. Il . 8 . 203 ; Diod. 15 . 49 . 2 -3 ; Strabo 8 . 7 . 2 ; Paus. 7 . 24 . 5 -6 ), and it is quite likely that this sanctuary acted as a common place of union for the Achaians prior to the destruction of Helike, when that function was assumed by the sanctuary of Zeus Homarios near Aigion (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 195 -96 , contra Aymard ( 1938 ) 286 -87 , 293 ; Walbank ( 2000 )). According to Strabo 6 . 1 . 13 , Is of Helike was the founder of Sybaris (no. 70 ) in South Italy. The reading ( οικιστηgraveς δ ' αυτηtildeς Οισ &lt;. . . οasper &gt; ' Ελικευacuteς ) is, however, unsure, and Bérard ( 1957 ) 141 n. 2 proposed either &lt; Συacuteβαρ &gt; ις or &lt; Σάγαρ &gt; ις .

236,Keryneia (Keryneus),Achaia,38.1,22.1,283,1406,"236 . Keryneia (Keryneus) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 10 , long. 22 . 10 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: C. Paus. 7 . 25 . 5 situates Keryneia above the road in an elevated position, and it is almost certainly to be located just south of the modern village of Mamousia, near Derveni (Rizakis ( 1995 ) 206 ; Barr .). The toponym is Κερυacuteνεια , ηasper (Paus. 7 . 25 . 5 ); epichoric form: Καρυacuteνεια (Polyb. 2 . 41 . 8 ). However, Κερυνία (Ael. VH 13 . 6 ) and Καρυνία (schol. Soph. OC42 ) are also attested. The epichoric city-ethnic is Καρυνευacuteς ( SEG 15 113 . 34 (C3l), 254 (C2s); Polyb. 2 . 41 . 14 (rC4s)). Καρυννευacuteς is also attested ( I.Magnesia 38 (C2l)). Keryneia is not described as a polis in any Archaic or Classical source, but Polyb. 2 . 41 . 7 -8 states that it was one of the poleis (in a political sense) that formed the Achaian Confederacy prior to the time of Philip II and Alexander. It was certainly a polis by C3 , when it began to strike Achaian Confederate coinage (Head, HN ² 417 ; SNG Cop. PhliasiaLaconia 236 -38 ). Its precise status in earlier times is unsure, though Paus. 7 . 25 . 3 -5 describes it as a πόλισ µ α and describes how it owed its strength to taking in refugees after the destruction of Mykenai (no. 353 ) in C5m (see also Anderson ( 1954 ) 73 ). Sculptural fragments appear to testify to the existence of an Archaic temple ( ArchDelt 39 B ( 1984 ) 99 )."
237,Leontion (Leontesios),Achaia,38.0,21.55,228,1089,"237 . Leontion (Leontesios) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 00 , long. 21 . 55 . Size of territory: ? Type: C. Leontion is probably to be located 3 km north of Kastritsi (Lauffer ( 1989 ) 380 ; Barr .). The toponym is Λεόντιον (Polyb. 2 . 41 ). The city-ethnic is Λεοντήσιος ( IvO 300 (C2f); SEG 15 254 (C2s)). No Archaic or Classical source calls Leontion a polis , but Polyb. 2 . 41 . 7 -8 records it as one of the poleis (in the political sense) that constituted the Achaian Confederacy in the period prior to Philip II and Alexander. The external use of individual ( SEG 26 530 ( 200 ); IvO 300 (C2f)) and collective ( SEG 15 254 ( 120 )) city-ethnics suggests strongly that it was a polis in the political sense by the end of C3 , though this dates to after its refoundation by Antigonos Gonatas (Strabo 8 . 7 . 5 ; cf. Baladié ad loc .; Lauffer ( 1989 ) 380 ; Rizakis ( 1995 ) 308 ). The walls date back only as far as the Heltic period, though a theatre appears to belong to C4 (Lauffer ( 1989 ) 380 ; TGR ii. 251 ). By the Roman period, the territory was called Λεοντησία (Strabo 8 . 7 . 5 ). ³"
238,Olenos (Olenios),Achaia,38.1,21.4,480,2357,"238 . Olenos (Olenios) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 10 , long. 21 . 40 . Size of territory: ? Type: B. Paus. 7 . 18 . 1 -2 and Strabo 8 . 7 . 4 situate Olenos between Dyme (no. 234 ) and Patrai (no. 239 ), and it is probably to be located west of modern Tsoukaleika (Rizakis ( 1995 ) 159 -60 ; Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 181 ; Barr .). The toponym is /acuteΩλενος , ηasper / οasper (Aesch. fr. 745 b, Mette; Hdt 1 . 145 ; Polyb. 2 . 41 . 7 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ολένιος ( IG v . 1 1 (C5s)), ' Ωλένιος ( SEG 14 375 . 10 (C4l)). No Archaic or Classical source calls Olenos a polis , but Polyb. 2 . 41 . 7 (rC4 ) calls it a polis in the political sense and attests to its membership of the Achaian Confederacy in the ³ The phrase ' Η δεgrave Τριταία τηtildeς Φαραϊκηtildeς εφάπτεται κα &lt; ιgrave Λ &gt; εοντησίας καιgrave Λασιωνίας does not appear in all manuscripts.

Furthermore, a citizen of Olenos who made contributions to Sparta (no. 345 ) in the middle phase of the Peloponnesian War is described as Αχαιοgraveς ' Ολένιος ( IG v . 1 1 ; cf. IG ii² 62 . 6 where the restoration τοgraveν ' Ωλ [ ένιον ] produces a pre-378 honorary decree for an Olenian) and this, together with the external application of the individual city-ethnic in a C4l inscription ( SEG 14 375 . 10 ), ought to suggest that Olenos was a Classical polis in the political sense. The external collective use of the ethnic is found in Aesch. fr. 745 c, Mette, and-referring to exiles-Ael. NA 5 . 29 (citing Theophr. fr. 109 ). Olenos is called a πόλισ µ α by the C3e poet Hermesianax (Paus. 7 . 18 . 1 ). Olenos was abandoned due to 'weakness' (Paus. 7 . 18 . 1 ), and its inhabitants were incorporated within Dyme (no. 234 ) (Strabo 8 . 7 . 1 ). Demand ( 1990 ) 61 -64 argues that this must have taken place after the time at which Herodotos was writing, though Strabo 8 . 7 . 1 seems to imply that Olenos still existed by 280 ; it had certainly been abandoned by C2 (Polyb. 2 . 41 . 7 ). The territory (called /acute Ωλενος γηtilde by Soph.fr. 300 , Radt) probably included the settlements of Peirai and Euryteiai (Paus. 7 . 18 . 2 ). According to an ancient commentator (schol. vet. Pind. Ol . 1 . 37 a), Pelops is supposed to have originated from the polis of Olenos."
239,Patrai (Patreus),Achaia,38.15,21.45,583,2814,"239 . Patrai (Patreus) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 15 , long. 21 . 45 . Size of territory: ? Type: [A]. The toponym is Πάτραι , αιasper (Thuc. 2 . 83 . 3 ; Ps.-Skylax 42 ). The city-ethnic is Πατρευacuteς (Hdt. 1 . 145 ; Thuc. 5 . 52 . 2 ; SEG 14 375 (C4l)), though Πατραιευacuteς appears to be attested in Polyb. 5 . 30 . 3 , 95 . 7 . Underlying the modern coastal city of Patras ( Barr .), Patrai is listed by Hdt. 1 . 145 as one of the original twelve mere of Achaia and is described as a polis (in the urban sense) by Ps.-Skylax 42 (C4f), where it is listed as the sixth toponym after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε . That it was considered to be a polis in the urban sense during C5l is rendered likely by Thucydides' notice ( 5 . 52 . 2 ) that in 419 the citizens of Patrai were persuaded by Alkibiades to extend their walls down to the sea; traces of these long walls have recently been found ( ArchDelt 52 ( 1997 ) Chron . 273 -75 ). Polyb. 2 . 41 . 7 -8 (rC4 ) calls it a polis in the political sense, and attests to its membership of the Achaian Confederacy prior to the time of Philip II and Alexander (cf. SEG 14 375 . 9 (C4l)). The external collective use of the city-ethnic is found in Hdt. 1 . 145 and Thuc. 5 . 52 . 2 , the external individual use in SEG 14 375 . 9 (C4l) and Paus. 6 . 4 . 6 (rC4s). According to tradition, Patrai was originally formed by the synoecism of Aroe,Antheia and Mesatis (Paus. 7 . 18 . 2 -6 ), three communities which shared the common cult of Artemis Triklaria (Paus. 7 . 19 . 1 ). In 279 , Patrai underwent a dioikismos , and its inhabitants settled in the polismata of Mesatis, Antheia, Boline, Argyra and Arba as well as Patrai (Paus. 7 . 18 . 6 ). This suggested to Curtius (( 1851 ) 437 , 453 ) that these polismata had formerly been demoi , which had earlier been incorporated through a second process of synoecism. Moggi, Sin . 89 -95 dates this latter synoecism to C6l or C5e, though it is worth noting that Herodotos' use in his list of Achaian mere ( 1 . 145 ) of the plural city-ethnic rather than the toponym may suggest that a multifocal settlement pattern still existed in C5m (Nilsson ( 1951 ) 22 -23 ). In 429 , the Peloponnesian fleet used Patrai, Panormos and Rhion as naval bases (Thuc. 2 . 83 . 3 , 86 . 1 -2 , 92 . 5 ), and this has suggested to Larsen ( 1953 ) 802 -3 that Patrai was by this time part of the Peloponnesian League. The territory was called Πατραϊκή (Theophr. Hist. pl . 9 . 15 . 8 , 20 . 2 ) and included the naval station of Panormosmodern Golimi-(Thuc. 2 . 86 . 1 , 4 , cf. 2 . 92 . 1 ) together with the settlements which were later to be resettled after dioikismos . In C4m,Cheilon of Patrai won a string of wrestling victories at the Isthmian, Nemean, Olympic ( Olympionikai 461 , 465 ) and Pythian Games (Paus 6 . 4 . 6 -7 )."

The city-ethnic is Πελληνευacuteς in Attic-Ionic (Thuc. 2 . 9 . 2 ; IG ii² 1388 A. 34 ( 398 / 7 )) and Πελλανευacuteς in the epichoric dialect ( SEG 3 83 ( 365 -335 ); IG ii² 220 ( 344 / 3 )); later sources retrospectively use Πελληναῖος (Cic. ad Att . ii 2 ; Plut. Mor . 399 B). Πελλπήνιος is also attested (Lycoph. Alex . 922 ). Almost certainly to be located on the Tserkova hill near the modern village of Pellini (Rizakis ( 1995 ) 225 ; Barr .), Pellene is the best-documented polis of Achaia. It is called a polis in the urban sense by Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 18 and Ps.-Skylax 42 , where it is listed as the first toponym after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε , and in the political sense by Thuc. 8 . 3 . 2 and Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 29 . In an honorific decree for some Pellenian presbeis passed by the Athenians in C4m ( IG ii² 220 ), [ ηasper πόλις τῶν Π ] ελλα [ νέων ] is restored in 15 -16 . Polyb. 2 . 41 . 7 -8 attests to its membership of the Achaian Confederacy in the time prior to Philip II and Alexander. There was a Πελληνέων πολιτεία among the 158 constitu- tions collected by Aristotle (frr. 583 -84 ), and Dikaiarchos (fr. 69 , Wehrli) wrote a similar work (Cic. ad Att . ii 2 ). Polites and demos are found in [Dem.] 17 . 10 . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found (abbreviated) on C4s coins ( infra ); the external collective use is attested in Thuc. 2 . 9 . 2 , 8 . 3 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 29 ; and IG ii² 220 . 8 ( 344 / 3 ). The external individual use is attested in Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 11 and IG ii² 1388 A. 34 ( 398 / 7 ) and SEG 3 83 ( 365 -335 ). The fact that a homonymous kome of Pellene existed between Pellene and Aigion (no. 231 ) (Strabo 8 . 7 . 5 ) may suggest that the polis of Pellene was the result of a series of synoecisms to which one of its constitutents gave its name (Koerner ( 1974 ) 468 ; Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 171 ). Other possible participants in this synoecism are Mysaion (Paus. 7 . 27 . 9 ), Kyros (Paus. 7 . 27 . 11 ), the harbour of Aristonautai (Paus. 7 . 26 . 14 , cf. 2 . 12 . 2 ), Poseidion-which is explicitly called a δηtilde µ ος (Paus. 7 . 27 . 8 )-and Olouros, which Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 17 describes as being besieged by the Pelleneis after its capture by the Arkadians (thus implying some form of urban settlement). According to tradition, Pellene was exposed to andrapodismos and destroyed by Sikyon (no. 228 ) in C6e, but refounded shortly afterwards (Zenob. 1 . 57 , citing Anaxandridas ( FGrHist 404 ) fr. 1 ; P Oxy . 1241 . iii . 2 -12 , citing Aristotle (not in Gigon), 1365 . 28 -45 ). This is not definitive proof of Pellene's status as a polis in the Archaic period ( contra Koerner ( 1974 ) 469 ), and it may be that the settlement that was destroyed was the kome of Pellene (Haussoullier ( 1917 ) 165 -66 ). At the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War in 431 , Pellene was the first Achaian city to join the Peloponnesian League (Thuc. 2 . 9 . 2 -3 ; cf. Ar. Lys . 996 ); it was still allied with Sparta (no. 345 ) shortly after the battle of Leuktra (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 2 ); action by its naval forces is attested at the battle of Abydos in 411 (Thuc. 8 . 106 . 3 ; Diod. 13 . 40 . 5 ; cf. Thuc. 2 . 9 . 3 , 8 . 3 . 2 , attesting to naval forces); infantry forces are attested at Thuc. 5 . 60 . 3 , at the battle of the Nemea in 395 (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 20 ), at Oneion in 369 (Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 15 -16 ) and at Lechaion in 369 (Paus. 9 . 15 . 4 ). In 367 , following the expulsion of oligarchs from the poleis of Achaia, Pellene allied herself with Thebes (no. 221 ) (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 11 ), though the oligarchs swiftly resumed power and forged new alliances with both Sparta and Elis (no. 251 ) (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 16 -18 ). In the 330 s, the Makedonians installed the tyrant Chairon ([Dem.] 17 . 10 ; Paus. 7 . 27 . 7 ; Ath. 509 B) and Pellene was the only Achaian city not to join King Agis' anti-Makedonian league (Aeschin. 3 . 165 ; Curt. 6 . 1 ). By and large, the constitution of Pellene was normally oligarchic, and according to Harp. s.v. Μαστηtildeρες , the Aristotelian Πελληνέων πολιτεία attested the existence of magistrates named mastroi (fr. 583 ). A period of democracy is implied by [Dem.] 17 . 10 . C4sees a number of citizens of Pellene appointed to diplomatic offices: apart from the hospitality afforded to presbeis of Pellene by Athens ( IG ii² 220 ( 344 / 3 )), a similar invitation to dine in the Athenian prytaneion is proffered to Andrion, son of Pausanias ( SEG 3 83 ( 365 -335 )); Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 16 refers to a proxenos of the Phliasians (no. 355 ); in 340 / 39 , Ekephylos, son of Charmides, was granted proxenia , politeia , promanteia and prodikia by Delphi (no. 177 ) ( BCH 23 ( 1899 ) 349 ); and shortly after 338 , Oikles was granted proxenia by the Boiotians ( SEG 25 553 ). Pellene's renown in the Panhellenic athletic circuit dates back as far as 542 , when Phanas won victories in the stade , the diaulos and the hoplitodromos at the Olympic Games (Euseb. Chron. 1 . 67 ; Olympionikai 142 -44 ). Sostratos won a victory in the boys' foot-race at Olympia in 460 (Paus. 6 . 8 . 1 ; Olympionikai 263 ), Promachos won the Olympic pankration in 404 (Paus. 7 . 27 . 5 ; Olympionikai 355 ) and in the third quarter of C4 the tyrant Chairon won two wrestling victories at Isthmia and four at Olympia (Paus. 7 . 27 . 5 ; Olympionikai 432 , 437 , 443 , 447 ). A victory in boys'boxing by Philip, described as Αζαgraveν εκ Πελλάνας , is recorded by Paus. 6 . 8 . 5 and dated to 436 in Olympionikai 319 (see Nielsen and Roy ( 1998 ) 36 -39 ). Pellene even hosted her own prize games, known variously as the Heraia (schol. Ar. Av . 1421 ), the Hermaia (schol. Ar. Av . 1421 ; schol. Pind. Ol . 9 . 116 c) or the Theoxenia (Paus 7 . 27 . 4 ; schol. Pind. Ol . 7 . 156 a). The games are already attested by C6l ( IG iv 510 ; Anth. Pal . 13 . 19 ; cf. Bacchyl. 9 . 33 , Jebb). A cult to (Zeus) Mellichios is known in C6 ( SEG 11 1272 ), but Apollo's importance at Pellene is suggested by the depiction of his head on silver and bronze coins dating to the period 370 -322 (Head, HN ² 415 ). Pellene struck coins in both silver (triobols) and bronze in C4s: obv . head of Apollo or a lyre; rev . tripod or ram's head in a wreath. Legend: ΠΕ or ΠΕΛ (Head, HN ² 415 -16 ; SNG Cop. Phliasia-Laconia 209 -23 )."
241,Pharai (Pharaieus),Achaia,38.05,21.45,362,1726,"241 . Pharai (Pharaieus) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 05 , long. 21 . 45 . Size of territory: ? Type: B. Paus. 7 . 22 . 1 situates Pharai near the river Peiros, and it is probably to be located at the modern village of Prevedos on the left bank of the river (Rizakis ( 1995 ) 186 ; Barr .). The toponym is regularly Φαραί (Polyb. 2 . 41 . 8 ), though Φάρα , ηasper is attested in a C4 inscription ( IG xii . 8 637 ). The city-ethnic is normally Φαραιευacuteς ( SEG 1 74 (C3s); IG v . 2 392 (C4 -C3 ); Polyb. 2 . 41 . 12 ); the Ionic form is Φαρευacuteς (Hdt. 1 . 145 ). Designated by Hdt. 1 . 145 as one of the original twelve mere of Achaia, Pharai is absent from Ps.-Skylax's list of Achaian poleis ( 42 ), though in this case the negative evidence should not be overstressed, since we would not expect to find an inland settlement recorded in a treatise composed as a periplous (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 167 ). Polyb. 2 . 41 . 7 -8 states that Pharai was one of the Achaian poleis (in the political sense) that constituted the Achaian Confederacy prior to the time of Philip II and Alexander. The external collective use of the city-ethnic is found in Hdt. 1 . 145 and Polyb. 2 . 41 . 12 (r 280 ); the external individual use is found in IG v . 2 392 (C4 -C3 ). A man of Φάρα is recorded in a C5l inscription listing Delphic theorodokoi ( Syll . ³ 90 . 3 ), and if this is a reference to a citizen of Achaian Pharai, then it might indicate polis status before 400 . It is possible, however, that the reference is to Arkadian Phara (no. 290 ). A citizen of Pharai was appointed proxenos and theorodokos by Arkadian Lousoi (no. 279 ) in C4 -C3 ( IG v . 2 392 ). The territory was called Φαραϊκή (Strabo 8 . 7 . 5 ; cf. Baladié ad loc ."
242,Phelloe,Achaia,38.05,22.25,218,1089,"242 . Phelloe Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 05 , long. 22 . 25 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: B. Paus. 7 . 26 . 10 locates Phelloe on the mountain road from Aigeira (no. 230 ), and it may possibly be situated at Zachali/Seliana (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 174 ; Barr .). The toponym is Φελλόα (-η ), ηasper ( BCH 70 ( 1946 ) 39 B; Paus. 7 . 26 . 10 ). Paus. 7 . 26 . 10 calls Phelloe a πόλισ µ α and claims that it had been settled ever since the Ionian occupation of Achaia. A C4m decree granting Delphic proxenia to an Αχαιοgraveς εκ Φελλόας ( BCH 70 ( 1946 ) 39 B) indicates that Phelloe was a polis in the political sense by C4 . If an eponymous mythical hero named Phellos,mentioned in Hes.fr. 167 (MW),is to be associated with Achaian Phelloe (see West ( 1985 ) 91 ), this might suggest the existence of a political community in the Archaic period. Certainly, surface exploration and limited excavation in the area have revealed settlement evidence and burials dating from C8s and continuing into the Archaic and Classical periods (Alzinger ( 1986 ) 319 -26 ; Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 174 )."
243,Rhypes (Rhyps),Achaia,38.15,22.0,568,2689,"243 . Rhypes (Rhyps) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 15 , long. 22 . 00 . Size of territory: ? Type: [A]. Paus. 7 . 23 . 4 situates Rhypes a little above the Aigion-Patrai road, some 30 stades from Aigion (no. 231 ). The identification is not certain, but it is often located on the Trapeza hill, 7 km west of Aigion (Rizakis ( 1995 ) 193 ; Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 179 ; Barr .). The toponym is ' Ρυacuteπες (Ps.-Skylax 42 ), ' Ρυacuteπαι (Strabo 8 . 7 . 5 ; Paus. 7 . 18 . 7 ) or ' Ρυacuteπη (Diod. 8 . 17 . 1 ). Steph. Byz. 548 . 4 also attests ' Ρυπαίη . The city-ethnic is ' Ρυacuteψ ( SGDI 1644 (C6 ); Hdt. 1 . 145 ; SEG 14 375 (C4l)). Pherecydes ( FGrHist 3 ) fr. 163 has Αacuteρυπες , presumably for the ethnic. Rhypes is one of the original twelve mere of Achaia (Hdt 1 . 145 ) and is cited as a polis in the urban sense in Ps.-Skylax 42 , where it is listed as the fifth toponym after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε . That status may possibly be retrojected, however, since according to Phot. Lex . p. 492 . 10 , Aischylos (fr. 394 , Nauck) had described Rhypes as a πόλις τῶν ' Ωλενίων Αχαιῶν . An even earlier attestation of what appears to be the external individual city-ethnic ' Ρυπ ( ό )[ ς ] in an Archaic inscription ( SGDI 1644 ) may just possibly indicate that Rhypes was a polis in the political sense during C6 . In C4l, the external application of the individual cityethnic is attested in SEG 14 375 . The external collective use of the city-ethnic is found in Hdt. 1 . 145 (cf. Pherecydes ( FGrHist 3 ) fr. 163 ). C4l membership of the Achaian Confederacy is suggested by SEG 14 375 . 8 . Anderson ( 1954 ) 73 suggests that Rhypes was abandoned in C4 , though this does not accord with the archaeological evidence (Rizakis ( 1995 ) 193 -94 ; Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 216 n. 19 ; Vordos (forthcoming)), and it would appear that it persisted until its destruction by Augustus,when its territory was distributed between Aigion (no. 231 ) and Pharai (no. 241 ) (Strabo 8 . 7 . 5 ), as well as Patrai (no. 239 ) (Paus. 7 . 18 . 7 ). The territory of Rhypes is designated variously ( εν τηsubiotaηtilde ' Ρυπικηsubiotaηtilde (Thuc. 7 . 34 . 1 ); τηgraveν δεgrave χώραν ' Ρυπίδα (Strabo 8 . 7 . 5 )), and seems to have included Erineos, in the vicinity of the modern Lambiri (Thuc. 7 . 34 . 1 ), and Leuktron (Strabo 8 . 7 . 5 ). Kroton (no. 56 ) in South Italy was reputedly founded by Myskellos of Rhypes (Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 10 ; Hippys of Rhegion ( FGrHist 554 ) fr. 1 ; Ps.-Skymnos 325 ; Diod. 8 . 17 ; Dion. Hal.

Paus. 7 . 22 . 6 , 10 describes Tritaia as an inland city 120 stades from Pharai (no. 241 ), and it should probably be located on the Voundoukla plateau near the modern village of Hagia Marina (Rizakis ( 1995 ) 189 ; Barr .). The toponym is Τριταία (Polyb. 2 . 41 . 8 ; Strabo 8 . 3 . 10 ), though Τρίτεια is also attested (Paus. 6 . 12 . 9 , 7 . 22 . 6 ). The city-ethnic is Τριταιευacuteς (Hdt. 1 . 145 ; SEG 1 74 (C3s); Polyb. 2 . 41 . 12 ). Tritaia is described as one of the original twelve mere of Achaia by Hdt 1 . 145 . It is absent from Ps.-Skylax's list ( 42 ), though-as in the case of Pharai (no. 241 )-negative evidence is not conclusive, since one would normally not expect to find an inland polis listed in a treatise composed as a periplous (Morgan and Hall ( 1996 ) 167 ). Polyb. 2 . 41 . 7 -8 (rC4 ) calls it a polis in the political sense, and attests its membership of the Achaian Confederacy in the period prior to Philip II and Alexander. The external collective use of the city-ethnic appears in Hdt. 1 . 145 and Polyb. 2 . 41 . 12 . In C3 , the cityethnic is used externally and individually ( SEG 1 74 ; IG v . 2 368 . 77 ff ( ante 280 )). Citizens of Tritaia are listed as proxenoi of Arkadian Kleitor (no. 276 ) in IG v . 2 368 . 77 ff ( ante 280 ). Cicero ( ad Att . 6 . 2 . 2 ) implies that Tritaia was attached to Arkadia after the foundation of Megalopolis (no. 282 ), but this is contradicted by Paus. 6 . 12 . 8 -9 , who appears to attest Tritaia's independence in C2m (cf. Nielsen and Roy ( 1998 ) 38 ). Tritaia was eventually annexed by Augustus, and its territory assigned to Patrai (Paus. 7 . 22 . 6 ). An eponymous damiorgos is attested in C3 (Sherk ( 1990 ) 258 -59 ). ## II. The Poleis"
245,Alasyaion (Alasyeus),Elis,,,194,1023,"245 . Alasyaion (Alasyeus) Map 58 . Unlocated. Type: C. The toponym is Αλασυαῖων (MSS at Strabo 8 . 3 . 10 , usually amended); the city-ethnic is Αλασυευacuteς (&gt; Αλασυtildeες (nom. pl.) in Siewert ( 1991 ) no. 3 = IvO 258 (C5m-C4e)); Steph. Byz. 72 . 17 -20 s.v. Αλήσιον suggests Αλησιευacuteς . Ale(i)sion, a Homeric place in Elis ( Il . 2 . 617 ) with a hill or mound ( Il . 11 . 757 ), was later (Strabo 8 . 3 . 10 ) identified with Alasyaion, described by Strabo as a chora around Amphidolia (no. 247 ) with a monthly market and previously a polis of Pisatis. In C5l or C4e the Alasyeis and the Akroreioi made a joint inscribed dedication at Olympia (Siewert ( 1991 ) no. 3 ): the dedication with collective ethnics suggests that Alasyaion may at the time have been a dependent polis of Elis (no. 251 ). It was presumably situated at the border of Pisatis and Amphidolia, and therefore probably not adjacent to Akroreia. According to Steph. Byz. 72 . 17 -20 its founder was Alesios, son of Skillous or of Gargettos."

It was a perioikic community. It is described retrospectively as a polis (in the political sense) of the Akroreians c. 400 (Diod. 14 . 17 . 8 ); Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 14 refers collectively to the poleis of the Akroreians in 365 , without naming Alion ( supra , on Akroreia)."
247,Amphidolia (Amphidolos),Elis,,,349,1628,"247 . Amphidolia (Amphidolos) Map 58 . Unlocated. Type: A. The toponym is Α µ φιδολία , ηasper (Strabo 8 . 3 . 24 ) and Α µ φιδολίς , -ίδος , ηasper (Strabo 8 . 3 . 10 ). The city-ethnic is Ανφίδολος (Siewert ( 1991 ) no. 2 (C5 -C4e)) or Α µ φίδολος (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 25 ). Though not precisely located, Amphidolia lay in hilly territory west of Olympia; Meyer ( RE xx. 1739 ) suggests that it did not extend into the upper valley of the river Lestenitsa, leaving a route on purely Eleian territory between Elis (no. 251 ) and Pisatis. In Strabo's day Margalai (presumably = Marganeis) was in Amphidolia ( 8 . 3 . 24 ), and Alasyaion (no. 245 ) near it ( 8 . 3 . 10 ). In the years following c. 400 it is seen to function as a polis : it is described as a (perioikic) polis in the political sense at Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 23 and 30 , and the Amphidoloi made a dedication at Olympia in C5 or C4e (Siewert ( 1991 ) no. 2 ), which provides an instance of the external collective use of the city-ethnic, as does Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 26 (cf. 4 . 2 . 16 , where it is used to name a military contingent). It is not known whenAmphidolia became subordinate to Elis, but presumably no later than adjacent Pisatis. Like all Eleian perioikoi , it was freed at the end of the Eleian-Spartan war c. 400 (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 25 , 30 ; Roy ( 1997 ) 299 -304 ). It probably then joined the Peloponnesian League, and in 394 sent troops ( sphendonetai ) to fight with Sparta (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ). Its later history is unknown; it was presumably regained by Elis c. 362 if not before (cf. Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 2 with Tuplin ( 1993 ) 183 -85 )."
248,(Anaitoi),Elis,,,185,1008,"248 . (Anaitoi) Map 58 . Unlocated. Type: B. The toponym is not attested. The city-ethnic is Αναίτο [ ς ], known only from IvO 10 ( c. 475 -450 ), where the collective and external use is attested in a 50 -year treaty of friendship with the equally unknown Metapioi (no. 260 ) (Minon ( 1994 ) no. 10 ; Staatsverträge 111 ). Since the treaty is in Eleian dialect, both the Anaitoi and the Metapioi presumably belong to the region of Elis, but may have been located anywhere in the region, either within the Eleian state proper or in perioikic territory north or south of the river Alpheios. The existence of an ethnic and the capacity to enter into a treaty with another community strongly suggest that the Anaitoi were a polis . Failure to observe the treaty is to be sanctioned by the proxenoi and the manteis (in Eleian mantier ), and ultimately by the iaromaoi : these are all known as Eleian officials at Olympia,but do not necessarily imply direct subordination to Elis ( 251 ). Cf. Metapioi (no. 260 )."
249,(Chaladrioi),Elis,,,215,1209,"249 . (Chaladrioi) Map 58 . Unlocated. Type: B. The toponym is not attested. The city-ethnic is Χαλάδριος known only from IvO 11 = Minon ( 1994 ) no. 9 , an agreement of C5e in which the internal and collective use is attested: hereditary Chaladrian citizenship is granted to a man called Deukalion, together with status equal to a proxenos and to a damiorgos (Gauthier ( 1972 ) 42 -44 ) and possession of 'the land in Pisa' . The community evidently had officials with the titles proxenos and damiorgos . The damos had considerable authority: the final clause in the decree is to apply 'unless the damos decides otherwise' .There seems no doubt that the Chaladrioi formed a polis . The text is in Eleian dialect, but the community is otherwise entirely unknown, and could belong anywhere in the region, either within the Eleian state proper or in perioikic territory north or south of the river Alpheios. For the suggestion that the land which the Chaladrioi evidently controlled in Pisa was land for camping during Olympic festivals, available for use at other times,see Roy ( 1997 ) 313 n. 31 : control of such a plot need not mean that the territory of the Chaladrioi was in or even very close to Pisatis."

The city-ethnic is ∆υσποντευacuteς (Tryphon fr. 15 . 5 ) or ∆υσπόντιος (Paus. 6 . 22 . 4 (rC6f)). It is called a polis in the urban sense in Tryphon fr. 15 . 5 = Steph.Byz. 245 . 19 ; Paus. 6 . 22 . 4 provides an instance of the external collective use of the city-ethnic in reference to C6f. Strabo 8 . 3 . 32 puts it in Pisatis on the mountain road from Olympia to Elis (no. 251 ) ( RE xx. 1737 ; contra Baladié ( 1978 ) 114 ), but does not call it one of the eight poleis of Pisatis. It produced one or two early Olympic victors (Phlegon ( FGrHist ) 257 fr. 4 (r 772 ) and possibly fr. 6 (r 672 ), where the text is disturbed), described as 'Eleian(s) from Dyspontion' . Paus. 6 . 22 . 4 reports that it was a perioikic community, though presumably not Pisatan since it joined Pisa in revolt against Elis c. 570 , and was destroyed. Strabo 8 . 3 . 32 says that Dyspontion was destroyed and that most of its inhabitants emigrated to Epidamnos (no. 79 ) and Apollonia (no. 77 ). There is no evidence of its later existence. Because of the Olympic victors, it may have been a polis . Dysponteus (or Dyspontos,Tryphon fr. 15 . 5 ), son of Oinomaos,was the oecist of Dyspontion (Paus. 6 . 22 . 4 )."

Isthm . 2 . 24 ) or ' Ηλεῖος (Hom. Il . 11 . 671 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 25 ). On distinguishing the Eleian ethnic from that of Alea (no. 265 ) in Arkadia, see Nielsen ( 1996 ) 118 . Elis is attested as a polis both in the urban sense (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 27 , 7 . 4 . 14 ; Ps.-Skylax 43 ) and in the political sense (Hdt. 8 . 73 . 2 ; Thuc. 5 . 47 . 3 (cf. IG i³ 83 ); Gorgias fr. 10 ( = Arist. Rh . 1416 a 1 -4 ); Pl. Hp. mai . 281 C; Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 27 , 7 . 4 . 17 ). Politai is used of the citizens by Hdt. 2 . 160 and Pl. Hp.mai . 282 E and Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 16 . There was an Aristotelian politeia of the Eleians (Heracl. Lemb. 21 ; Arist. frr. 499 -500 ); cf. Plut. Adv. Col . 1126 C (reform of the politeia of the Eleians by Plato's pupil Phormio) and Arist. Pol . 1306 a 16 -19 ( politeia as conduct of state business among the Eleians). Asty is used of the town Elis by Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 26 , 7 . 4 . 32 (cf. 3 . 2 . 27 : ταgrave προάστια ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally in Siewert ( 1991 ) no. 4 (C6l) and on C6l-C5 coins ( infra ) and externally in ML 27 . 9 ( 479 -478 ); Hecat. fr. 25 . 2 ; Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 ; Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 . The individual use is found internally in IvO 271 = LSAG no. 19 ( c. 450 -425 ?) and externally in Hdt. 5 . 45 . 2 ; Pl. Ap . 19 E; Dem. 18 . 295 ; IG ii² 8528 (C4e); IG vii 414 . 22 -23 , 25 -26 (C4m); and IG ii² 3827 (C4m). Elis is implicitly described as patris at Dem. 18 . 291 -92 (cf. Hdt. 6 . 127 . 1 -4 implicitly describing it as patre ). The territory was called /tildeΗλις (already in Hom. Il 2 . 615 ; also Hdt. 6 . 70 . 2 ; Thuc. 2 . 66 . 1 ), and also ' Ηλεῖα (Hdt. 4 . 30 . 1 ; Thuc. 2 . 25 . 3 ). Κοίλη /tildeΗλις was used for the area of the valley of the river Peneios (first by Thuc. 2 . 25 . 3 ), believed to be the area originally controlled by the Eleians (cf. Arist. fr. 500 ). The territory was at least sometimes understood as including perioikic areas: Thuc. 5 . 34 . 1 , putting Lepreon (no. 306 ) on the border of Lakonike and Eleia, must include in Eleia at least Triphylia north of Lepreon, if not Lepreon itself; and Diod. 14 . 17 . 8 (r 400 ) apparently includes Lasion (no. 256 ) in Elis. There is, however,no reason to suppose that perioikic territory was formally incorporated into the Eleian state proper in the Classical period (Roy ( 1997 ) 297 -98 ; cf. Roy ( 1999 )). Apart from the town of Elis, there were numerous other settlements in Eleia, including urban sites, though their status is often not clear. Within the Eleian state proper Alasyaion (no. 245 ), Kyllene (no. 254 ) and Pylos (no. 263 ) may have been (dependent) poleis , while other settlements are reliably or plausibly reported especially at Harpina, Herakleia and Salmone (all in Pisatis), and at Hyrmine, Myrtountion and Pheia. There was also the sanctuary at Olympia, run by Elis at least from C6 . Elis also controlled perioikic communities north of the river Alpheios at Amphidolia (no. 247 ), Letrinoi (no. 258 ), Marganeis (no. 259 ), Lasion (no. 256 ) and (in Akroreia) Alion (no. 246 ), Eupagion(no. 252 ), Opous (no. 261 ) and Thraistos (no. 264 ), besides numerous perioikic communities in Triphylia south of the Alpheios (on which see Nielsen, in this volume 540 -46 ). There is very limited evidence on population size: 3 , 000 hoplites from Elis are recorded in 418 (Thuc. 5 . 58 . 1 , 75 . 5 ) and 3 , 000 jointly from Elis, Triphylia,Akroreia and Lasion in 394 (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ). Though there is no hard evidence of a Spartan-Eleian alliance before the Persian Wars (Hdt. 8 . 72 , 9 . 77 . 3 ; Paus. 5 . 4 . 7 ), Elis may have been among the earliest members of the Peloponnesian League (Tausend ( 1992 ) 167 ); membership lasted till Elis quarrelled with Sparta (no. 345 ) over Lepreon in 420 (Thuc. 5 . 31 . 1 -5 , 34 . 1 ). War between Sparta and Elis c. 400 (Roy ( 1997 ) 283 -84 , 299 -304 ) was ended by a treaty under which Elis evidently rejoined the Peloponnesian League, since it is seen as Sparta's ally in 394 (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ), 382 (Diod. 15 . 31 . 2 ) and 374 (Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 3 ). Elis' membership of the League finally ended in the aftermath of Leuktra (Roy ( 1994 )). C. 500 Elis made a treaty, for 100 years and agreeing inter alia mutual military support, with the otherwise unknown Ewaoioi (no. 253 ) ( IvO 9 ), in which Elis was the superior partner (Roy ( 1998 ) 367 -68 ; Roy and Schofield ( 1999 )). Treaties of symmachia with Corinth (no. 227 ), Argos (no. 347 ) and Lepreon (no. 306 ) are mentioned at Thuc. 5 . 31 . 1 ; Elis formed a major alliance in 420 -418 with Athens (no. 361 ), Argos (no. 347 ) and Mantinea (no. 281 ) (Thuc. 5 . 47 ; IG i³ 83 ), and in 370 an alliance with Arkadia, Argos (no. 347 ) and Thebes (no. 221 ) (Diod. 15 . 62 . 3 ; Dem. 16 . 12 , 19 -20 ; see Roy ( 1994 ) 190 ), which broke down when Elis and Arkadia went to war in 365 (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 12 ; Diod. 15 . 77 . 1 -2 ). IG ii² 112 ( 362 / 1 ) records a treaty of symmachia between Elis and Athens (no. 361 ), Arkadia, Achaia and Phleious (no. 355 ). Elis was a member of the League of Corinth set up by Philip II in 338 -337 (cf. RO 76 ; Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 623 -46 ). A supposed early synoecism of Elis (Paus. 5 . 4 . 3 ) by Oxylos seems unhistorical (so rightly Moggi, Sin . 160 ). In 471 (Diod. 11 . 54 . 1 ), 'after the Persian Wars' (Strabo 8 . 3 . 2 ), the Eleians were synoecised ( συνΩsubiotaωκίσθησαν , both authors). Diodorus says the Eleians were synoecised from numerous small poleis into one; Strabo that they had previously lived κω µ ηδόν , and then came together into the polis Elis from many demoi . Strabo also says that the Eleians were synoecised from the perioikides , a term presumably used in a purely local sense, not suggesting that subordinate perioikic communities were incorporated (Roy ( 1997 ) 285 -89 ). There may be other references to this synoecism in Ps.-Skylax 43 (a συνοικία πόλεων in Elis) and in Leandr(i)os ( FGrHist 492 ) fr. 13 (Eleians lived in komai and were then gathered into one polis ). The ancient sources do not clarify the nature of the synoecism (Moggi, Sin . 157 -66 ; Roy ( 1997 ) 286 -89 , ( 2002 b )). A unitary Eleian state certainly existed before 471 , as did the town Elis (Eder and Mitsopoulos ( 1999 ); see also Y alouris ( 1994 ) on the town in the Archaic period and later). Political restructuring within Elis may have accompanied the synoecism: see Gehrke, Stasis 55 , 365 -67 ; but note the scepticism of Walter ( 1993 ) 118 and n. 19 , 124 and n. 55 . Strabo's report ( 8 . 3 . 15 ) that Hypana in Triphylia was synoecised into Elis must-if accurate-refer to a period after C3 (Moggi, Sin . 164 n. 18 ). The following Eleian refugees are attested: commanders exiled during the Persian Wars (Hdt. 9 . 77 . 3 ); oligarchs, after a failed oligarchic coup c. 400 (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 27 -29 : cf. Paus. 3 . 8 . 4 -5 ); democrats driven out of the town of Elis in 365 (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 16 , 26 ); Eleians exiled by oligarchs in 343 (Dem. 19 . 260 , 294 ; Paus. 4 . 28 . 4 , 5 . 4 . 9 ; Diod. 16 . 63 . 4 -5 ; cf. Dem. 9 . 27 and 18 . 295 ); and pro-Makedonian exiles restored after Alexander overcame Thebes in 335 (Arr. Anab . 1 . 10 . 1 : presumably exiled when Elis tried to leave the League of Corinth on the death of Philip (Diod. 17 . 3 . 5 , cf. 17 . 8 . 5 )). C. 350 (?) a law was passed (supplementing an earlier text) about the return of exiles and the treatment of their relatives and property ( DGE 424 ). In 365 there were Arkadian exiles in Elis (Diod. 15 . 77 . 1 ). Elis took part in the Persian Wars (ML 27 . 9 ; cf. Hdt. 8 . 72 . 3 , 9 . 77 . 3 ). Eleian hoplite contingents are recorded in 418 (Thuc. 5 . 58 . 1 ) and 394 (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ); 300 logades are mentioned by Thuc. 2 . 25 . 4 ; 300 was also the number of the special guard which is attested in C4 (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 13 , 16 , 31 ) and whose commander is mentioned at Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 31 (Pritchett ( 1974 ) 223 ). Commanders ( hegemones ) are mentioned at Hdt. 9 . 77 . A hipparchos is attested at Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 19 , and hippeis are mentioned at Hell . 7 . 4 . 16 , 26 . An Eleian navy is mentioned or implied by Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 , 46 . 1 , 2 . 9 . 3 (cf. Diod. 14 . 34 . 1 ); it was presumably served by the harbours at Pheia (Thuc. 2 . 25 . 4 ) and Kyllene ( 2 . 84 . 5 ). The Eleian Teutiaplos was evidently a commander in the Peloponnesian fleet in 427 (Thuc. 3 . 29 . 2 ). An Eleian embassy went to Corinth (no. 227 ) and then Argos (no. 347 ) in 421 (Thuc. 5 . 31 . 1 , cf. 5 . 44 . 2 ); for Eleian diplomatic activity cf. Hippias' claims to be preferred as ambassador (Pl. Hp. mai . 281 A) and Hdt. 2 . 160 . 1 and Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 38 . A quarrel between Elis and Lepreon (no. 306 ) was arbitrated by Sparta (no. 345 ), but Elis refused to accept the verdict (Thuc. 5 . 31 . 3 ; Roy ( 1998 )). In C5f, Elis itself passed a verdict in a case of unknown nature, involving Athens (no. 361 ), Thespiai (no. 222 ), the Boiotians and the Thessalians ( SEG 26 475 , 31 358 ). The earliest award of proxeny by Elis (with a guarantor) is recorded by an unpublished inscription of c. 550 -500 (Marek ( 1984 ) 23 ; Taeuber ( 1991 ) 112 ). An inscription of C5m records an award of citizenship (Taita ( 2001 ) 57 -60 ). If the Chaladrians (no. 249 ) were a community within Elis proper, the award of Chaladrian citizenship ( IvO 11 ( c. 500 -475 ); Minon ( 1994 ) no. 9 ) presumably made the recipient an Eleian citizen; but the Chaladrians may have been perioikic. Elis announced the holding of the Olympic Games, and the beginning of the Olympic truce (Rougemont ( 1973 ); Jameson et al . ( 1993 ); cf. Thuc. 5 . 49 . 1 -4 ). An unpublished inscription of C5m records an award of citizenship and theorodokia (Taeuber ( 1991 ) 112 ). The Tenedian honorand of IvO 39 (C3 or C2e) was hereditary theorodokos of Elis, and entertained theoroi . It may have been Elis which developed the system of theorodokia (Perlman ( 2000 ) 18 -20 ), naturally in order to facilitate the epangelia for the Olympics. Hippias of Elis dated the first Olympic Games to 776 , but archaeological evidence suggests that the Games gained major popularity only from C8l (Morgan ( 1990 ) 26 -56 ). Besides that of Zeus, numerous other cults developed at the sanctuary of Olympia (Paus. 5 . 15 . 3 -10 ). There was also an important oracle of Zeus (Jacquemin ( 1999 -2002 ), hereafter J.) on Paus. 5 . 13 . 11 ). The first temple at Olympia was that of Hera ( c. 600 ) (J. on Paus. 5 . 16 . 1 ), followed by the temple of Zeus in the second quarter of C5 (J. on Paus. 5 . 10 . 2 -12 . 8 ). No earlier than C5 the shrine of Pelops (Pelopion) was surrounded by a hexagonal enclosure, and a monumental porch was added in C4 (J. on Paus. 5 . 13 . 1 ). The last temple built in the Altis was the Metröon (C5l) (J. on Paus. 5 . 20 . 9 ). All these buildings stood within the defined sacred area,the Altis (see J.on Paus. 5 . 10 . 1 ). On a terrace north of the Altis twelve (?) treasuries were built by different Greek poleis to store offerings: the earliest was that of Gela (no. 17 ) ( c. 600 ), while others belonged to Megara (no. 225 ), Metapontion (no. 61 ), Selinous (no. 44 ), Kyrene (no. 1028 ), Sybaris (no. 70 ), Byzantion (no. 674 ), Epidamnos (no. 79 ), Syracuse (no. 47 ), Sikyon (no. 228 ) and an unknown state (J.on Paus. 6 . 19 . 1 -15 ; there are difficulties reconciling Pausanias and the archaeological findings). Two buildings were built close to each other south of the Altis, the older c. 550 -500 and the other C5e, and they were joined by further construction in C4 ; they have been identified as the bouleuterion , though it has been doubted whether that was their original function (Gneisz ( 1990 ) 340 -1 ; J. on Paus. 5 . 23 . 1 ; note the reservations of Morgan and Coulton ( 1997 ) 112 -13 ). North of the Altis a prytaneion was constructed in C5e (Miller ( 1978 ) 86 -91 , 235 -239 ). The original stadion was moved east out of the Altis by C6m, and developed and extended later (Mallwitz ( 1988 )). Classical Greeks believed in early conflict between Elis and Pisatis for control of Olympia, but it is difficult to construct a reliable narrative from the surviving accounts: at any rate Elis effectively controlled Olympia by some time in C6 . Both the town of Elis and the Olympic sanctuary served as political centres for the polis Elis from the C6 onwards. Various Elean officials (e.g. the hellanodikai ) carried out duties at both places, and their duties concerning the sanctuary and the Games overlapped with their other responsibilities (Minon ( 1994 ) ii. 508 -9 ; Roy ( 1999 ) 159 , ( 2002 b ) 257 ). The use of both Elis and Olympia for political purposes made the Elean polis remarkably bicentral. The sanctuary, though under Elean control and sometimes exploited by Elis (Roy ( 1998 )), attracted Greeks from other communities in large numbers, and received a multitude of dedications (described by Paus.) from both individuals and poleis , including armour and weapons dedicated to celebrate victory in war. Texts of documents such as inter-state treaties were displayed there, and the large gatherings at the Games were an occasion for political speeches and pronouncements to the Greek world. The sanctuary's Panhellenic character of course made control all the more valuable to Elis. Ascivic subdivisions,twelve phylai are attested in 368 . The number was reduced to eight in 364 because of territory lost in war with Arkadia (Paus. 5 . 9 . 4 -6 ), and apparently remained at eight (Paus. 5 . 16 . 7 ). See Jones, POAG 142 -45 , and Roy ( 1997 ) 297 -98 . The form of constitution changed several times in Elis (Gehrke, Stasis 52 -57 , 365 -67 ; cf. Bultrighini ( 1990 )). In C6 an extreme oligarchy was largely controlled by a few families (Arist. Pol . 1306 a 13 -19 ), though probably later became more moderate (but, pace Gehrke, the Chaladrian decree IvO 11 may not be directly relevant). Elis then became democratic, possibly in the synoecism of 471 (Diod. 11 . 54 . 1 ; Strabo 8 . 3 . 2 ), and-despite an attempted oligarchic coup d'état c. 400 (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 27 -29 ; cf. Paus. 3 . 8 . 4 -5 )-retained democratic constitutional forms until 365 , when oligarchs took control (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 15 -16 ). Reconciliation between oligarchs and democrats ( DGE 24 ) may be dated c. 350 , and may have been followed by constitutional reform by Plato's pupil Phormio (Plut. Adv. Col . 1206 C). Probably in 343 there was an oligarchic coup d'état (Dem. 19 . 260 , 294 ; Paus. 4 . 28 . 4 , 5 . 4 . 9 ; Diod. 16 . 63 . 4 -5 ; cf. Dem. 9 . 27 and 18 . 295 ).After Philip's death Elis tried to break away from the League of Corinth (Diod. 17 . 3 . 5 , cf. 17 . 8 . 5 ), apparently exiling proMakedonians; after Alexander overcame Thebes, Elis took back these exiles (Arr. Anab . 1 . 10 . 1 ). On public enactments, see Minon ( 1994 ) ii. 514 -16 . Examples of laws are IvO 4 (Minon ( 1994 ) no. 6 ( c. 500 -480 ), law concerning the theokolos ); IvO 2 (Minon ( 1994 ) no. 14 ( c. 475 -450 ), decree concerning Patrias); DGE 424 ( c. 350 (?), law concerning exiles). Lawcourts are attested in an inscription of C6found at the town of Elis (Siewert ( 1994 b ) and ( 2001 )). It is notable that Olympian Zeus was often involved in sanctions for offences (e.g. IvO 2 , 3 ; Minon ( 1994 ) ii. 516 -26 ); this involvement extended to the treaty with the Ewaoioi (no. 253 ) ( IvO 9 ; Roy and Schofield ( 1999 )), and to the penalty imposed on Sparta (no. 345 ) for alleged breach of the Olympic truce in 420 (Thuc. 5 . 49 . 1 -50 . 4 ; Roy ( 1998 )). Elis also held Olympic tribunals, delivering judgments and penalties (Thuc. 5 . 49 . 1 -50 . 4 (cf. Hyp. frr. 111 -12 ); Siewert ( 1981 ); Minon ( 1994 ) ii. 490 -95 ; Roy ( 1998 )). As eponymous officials (Sherk ( 1990 b ) 233 -34 ), damiorgoi are attested in IvO 17 (C5l-C4e, number unknown), SEG 15 241 (C4 , two damiorgoi ), DGE 424 (C4m,one damiorgos ). Cf. IvO 39 (C3 or C2e), with eponymous hellanodikai . On the boule , see Minon ( 1994 ) ii. 509 -11 . There was an early oligarchic council of ninety gerontes , in which membership was for life, and election was dominated by a few families so that, even among the oligarchs, few gained membership (Arist. Pol . 1306 a 13 -19 ). By c. 525 -500 there was a council of 500 ( IvO 7 = Minon ( 1994 ) no. 1 ; cf. reference to a council in IvO 3 = Minon ( 1994 ) no. 5 ( c. 500 -475 )), presumably later replaced by the council of 600 found in 420 (Thuc. 5 . 47 . 9 ). On other officials, see e.g. Thuc. 5 . 47 . 9 ( demiourgoi and thesmophylakes ) and Minon ( 1994 ) ii. 473 -509 . In IvO 9 ( c. 500 ) τελεσταgrave appears as a generic term for an official, as opposed to an ordinary citizen ( Γaltέτας ). Officials called mastroi had powers to review actions of other magistrates ( IvO 2 ( c. 475 -450 )) and judicial decisions ( SEG 31 358 ( c. 475 -470 )). Among other officials the hellanodikai were important, but the development of the office is not clear (Jones, POAG 142 -45 with nn. at 152 -53 ; Bultrighini ( 1990 ) 146 -65 ); the original title was possibly diaitater (Ebert and Siewert ( 1999 )). The administration of Olympic affairs overlapped considerably with other functions of Eleian officials (Minon ( 1994 ) ii. 508 -9 ; Roy ( 1999 ) 159 ). On the assembly, see Minon ( 1994 ) ii. 511 -13 . There are references to meetings of an assembly as damos plethyon in IvO 7 ( = Minon ( 1994 ) no. 1 ( c. 525 -500 )) and 3 ( = Minon ( 1994 ) no. 5 ( c. 500 -475 )). There is a reference to a decision of the damos in IvO 13 ( = Minon ( 1994 ) no. 12 ( c. 475 -450 )), and in IvO 7 the damos has power to take a definitive decision in jurisdiction. For the public architecture of Elis, see the description of the town Elis by Paus. 6 . 23 . 1 -26 . 3 . Architectural fragments suggest that there were several monumental structures already in the Archaic period (Yalouris, PECS 299 -300 ('Elis'); Eder and Mitsopoulos ( 1999 ) 25 -35 ). While at least some functions of the state took place at the town Elis by C6 (Siewert ( 1994 b )), there were also buildings for such purposes at Olympia, which may have been the major seat of Eleian government in C6 (Hansen and Fischer-Hansen ( 1994 ) 86 -89 ). There was a bouleuterion at Olympia (see Gneisz ( 1990 ) 340 -41 , dating its first phase to C6s). On the C5e prytaneion at Olympia, see Miller ( 1978 ) 86 -91 , 235 -39 . There was an agora at Elis (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 28 (r c. 400 ); Martin ( 1951 ) 311 -13 , cf. 241 -44 on two areas at Olympia which he saw as agoras). On the south stoa ( c. 450 -425 ) and the west stoa (C5 or early C4 ) at Elis, see Coulton ( 1976 ) 237 ; at Olympia there were the Echo Stoa of c. 340 -330 (Jacquemin ( 1999 -2002 ) on Paus. 5 . 21 . 17 ), and others. At Elis the temple of Athena on the acropolis was probably erected in the Archaic period (Yalouris, PECS ). The cult site at Olympia was already well established in the Archaic period (Morgan ( 1990 ) 26 -56 ; Sinn ( 1994 ) on early developments); see also Yalouris, PECS 646 -650 . The theatre at Elis was first built c. 300 (Glaser ( 2001 ); TGR ii. 207 ). On gymnasia at Elis, see Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 27 ( c. 400 ); on the gymnasion at Olympia, see Wacker ( 1996 ), dating the first phase (p. 24 ) to C4 or C3e. On a plan of settlement in the town of Elis from the Classical to the Roman periods the area of settlement is shown as between 4 and 5 km ² , extending north of the river Peneios (Yalouris ( 1972 b ) 141 ; see also Y alouris ( 1994 )). Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 27 says that c. 400 the gymnasia were near the suburbs ( proastia ), but on Yalouris' plan they are shown near the centre of the area of settlement, which may have grown after c. 400 . The hill Kaloskopi became the acropolis of Elis (Yalouris, PECS : cf. Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 15 (r 365 ) and Paus. 6 . 26 . 3 ), but was apparently not fortified until 312 (note the wording of Diod. 19 . 87 . 2 -3 ). The town of Elis was unwalled c. 400 according to Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 27 (Roy ( 1997 ) 299 -304 ). No walls are shown on Yalouris' plan, and no remains of walls have been reported from subsequent archaeological investigation. The most important cult at Elis was that of Zeus Olympios, under Eleian control at least from C6 (Siewert ( 1987 -88 ) 7 ), and Elis organised the Olympic festival and the Heraia at Olympia ( KlPauly iv. 286 -88 , ii. 1031 -32 ). On Eleian victors at Olympia, Delphi and Nemea, see Crowther ( 1988 ). Eleians did not participate in the Isthmian Games (e.g. Paus. 5 . 2 . 2 ). Communal dedications by the Eleians at Olympia are attested in C6 (Siewert ( 1991 b ) nos. 4 -8 ) and C4 ( DGE 423 ); on the surprising rarity of Eleian dedications at Olympia,see Taeuber ( 1991 ) 113 . Elis had its own calendar, with some month names not known from elsewhere (Samuel ( 1972 ) 95 -97 , 284 , 288 , 294 ; Trümpy, Monat . 199 -201 ). From C6l Elis struck silver coinage on the Aiginetan standard, mainly staters but also smaller denominations. From C5l bronze coins were also struck. Most coins carried the Eleian city-ethnic (or an abbreviation), but from C5e coins were also struck with the legend ΟΛΥΝΠΙΚΟΝ (spelt with kappa or koppa), clearly in connection with Olympic festivals. Frequent types were Olympian Zeus and his attributes (thunderbolt, eagle), and also Hera (Head, HN ² 419 -25 ; Seltman ( 1921 ) on silver coinage only; Kraay ( 1976 ) 103 -7 ; Franke ( 1984 ); SNG Cop. Phliasia-Laconia 352 -418 ). There is no reason to accept Seltman's view that Eleian coinage was essentially a 'temple coinage' (Warren ( 1962 ); Nicolet-Pierre ( 1975 )). Elis established four colonies in southern Epeiros: Boucheta (no. 90 ), Elateia (no. 94 ), Pandosia (no. 104 ) and Batiai (no. 88 ) (Theopomp. fr. 206 ; Dem. 7 . 32 ; Strabo 7 . 7 . 5 ). Though not precisely dated, the foundations are assigned to C8 -C6 (Hammond ( 1967 ) 427 , 478 ; Dakaris ( 1971 ) 16 , 30 -33 ). Varying legendary accounts of the foundation of Elis existed in the Classical period,giving prominence to the role of Oxylos,but also reflecting in one way or another Elis'relations with Aitolia (cf. Hdt. 8 . 73 ), Elis' relations with Sparta, and Elis' struggle with Pisa for control of Olympia. The accounts are heavily affected by political considerations of the Classical period. See Sordi ( 1994 )."
252,Eupagion,Elis,,,98,511,"252 . Eupagion Map 58 . Unlocated. Type: B. The toponym Ευπάγιον occurs only in Diod. 14 . 17 . 8 (all modern editors wrongly accept Wesseling's emendation: ' Επιτάλιον , impossible because it lay south of the Alpheios). A cityethnic is not attested. It was a perioikic community. It is described as a polis (in the political sense) of the Akroreians c. 400 (Diod. 14 . 17 . 8 ); Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 14 refers collectively to the poleis of the Akroreians in 365 , without naming Eupagion ( supra , on Akroreia)."
253,(Ewaoioi),Elis,,,150,791,"253 . (Ewaoioi) Map 58 . Unlocated.Type: B.The toponym is not attested. The city-ethnic is ' ΕΓaltαοίος ( IvO 9 ; Roy and Schofield ( 1999 )); the ethnic had previously been read as ' ΕρΓaltαοίος and referred to Heraia (no. 274 ) in Arkadia, or as ' ΕυΓaltαοίος and referred to an unknown Eleian community; but see Roy and Schofield ( 1999 ). The inscription attests the collective and external use of the city-ethnic. The community is known only from IvO 9 of c. 500 , a 100 -year alliance with Elis (no. 251 ). The alliance may well be an example of the hegemonial alliance by which Elis structured its relations with its perioikoi (Siewert ( 1994 a ); Ebert and Siewert ( 1999 ); Roy ( 1997 ) 292 -95 ); if so, the Ewaoioi will have been a perioikic polis somewhere in the region of Elis."
254,Kyllene (Kyllenios),Elis,21.05,37.55,319,1552,"254 . Kyllene (Kyllenios) Map 58 . Lat. 21 . 05 , long. 37 . 55 . Size of territory: unknown, presumably 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Κυλλήνη , ηasper (Thuc. 1 . 30 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 43 ). The external and individual use of the city-ethnic Κυλλήνιος occurs in Hom. Il . 15 . 518 ), but is not found in Classical sources. Called a polis (and limen ) only by Ps.-Skylax 43 (Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 148 ), Kyllene is often called epineion as a base for the Eleian fleet (e.g. Thuc. 1 . 30 . 2 ). By c. 400 it was fortified (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 ; Roy ( 1997 ) 299 -304 ; cf. Diod. 19 . 66 . 2 (r 314 ); Polyb. 5 . 3 . 1 (r 218 )). Strabo 8 . 3 . 4 calls it a kome metria , with a remarkable ivory statue of Asklepios; Paus. 6 . 26 . 4 mentions sanctuaries of Asklepios and Aphrodite and a popular cult of Hermes.On its location and archaeological remains, see Servais ( 1961 ), who makes a convincing case for identifying it with the physical remains immediately adjacent to modern Killini (despite the lack of conclusive documentary evidence). There was a town on that site at least from C5 to the Roman imperial period;there is no direct evidence of ancient fortifications in place, but Servais ( 1961 ) 140 ) found numerous large blocks of stone which he identified as having once belonged to ancient fortifications. Kyllene had cults of Asklepios (Strabo 8 . 3 . 4 ; Paus. 6 . 26 . 4 ), Aphrodite (Paus. 6 . 26 . 4 ) and Hermes (Paus. 6 . 26 . 4 ). Only the reference in Ps.-Skylax 43 suggests that Kyllene had the status of a polis ."
255,Laris(s)a,Elis,,,137,712,"255 . Laris(s)a Map 58 . Unlocated, not in Barr . Type: A. Larisa was situated in the borderland between Elis (no. 251 ) and Achaian Dyme (no. 234 ) according to Theopomp. fr. 386 , who calls it a polis in the urban sense. The location may be confirmed by a reference in the MSS of Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 23 ( καταgrave Λάρισσαν ) to a toponym 'Larissa' on a route through Achaia into Elis, though modern editors generally follow Portus' emendation to καταgrave Λάρισον , referring to the river between Achaia and Elis (Strabo 8 . 7 . 5 ). Nothing else is known about this Laris(s)a (cf. Hansen ( 2000 ) 193 ), and, according to the references in Theopompos and Xenophon,it could have been in either Achaia or Elis."
256,Lasion (Lasionios),Elis,21.45,37.5,301,1389,"256 . Lasion (Lasionios) Map 58 . Lat. 21 . 45 , long. 37 . 50 . Size of territory: unknown but probably 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Λασιῶν , οasper (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 ). The city-ethnic is Λασιώνιος (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ). Lasion is described by Polyb. 4 . 73 . 1 (r 219 / 18 ) as a polis in the urban sense; Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 23 , 30 describes it as a (perioikic) polis in the political sense. The external collective city-ethnic is used by Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 (r 394 ) for a military contingent; the external individual use is attested in the Heltic period (Euphorion of Chalkis fr. 47 , de Cuenca, apud Ath. 44 F). It is not known when Lasion became perioikic: it certainly was by the Eleian-Spartan war of c. 400 , after which it became independent (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 ) and probably joined the Peloponnesian League, sending troops (hoplites) to support Sparta (no. 256 ) in 394 (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ). It was claimed as Arkadian c. 400 (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 ), and joined the Arkadian League in the 360 s (Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 26 , where 'the others' must refer to Lasion). In 365 it was captured by Elis (no. 251 ), or Arkadian exiles backed by Elis, but was soon recaptured by Arkadia (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 12 -13 ; Diod. 15 . 77 . 1 ). The site has been identified (though without documentary proof) and examined but not excavated (Pritchett ( 1989 ) 28 -30 )."

Byz. 413 . 17 -18 for the toponym Ληtildeνος and the cityethnic Ληναῖος . A Ληναῖος was Olympic victor in 588 (Phlegon ( FGrHist 257 ) fr. 7 = Steph.Byz. 413 . 17 -18 ). Steph. Byz. 413 . 17 describes it as a chora of Pisatis, but it may have been a polis because of the Olympic victor, whose ethnic was presumably given by Phlegon."
258,Letrinoi (Letrinos),Elis,,,383,1773,"258 . Letrinoi (Letrinos) Map 58 . Probably lat. 21 . 25 , long. 37 . 40 . Size of territory: unknown,presumably 1 or 2 . Type:A. The toponym is Λετρῖνοι , οιasper (Paus. 6 . 22 . 8 ) or Λέτρινα , ηasper (Lyc. Alex . 54 ). The city-ethnic is Λετρῖνος (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 25 ), or Λεδρῖνος (Siewert ( 1991 b ) no. 9 (C6s)). Letrinoi lay 120 stades from Olympia and 180 from Elis (no. 251 ) on the Olympia-Elis road through the plain (Paus. 6 . 22 . 8 ); locations near modern Ag. Ioannis ( RE xii. 2148 , xx. 1732 -55 ) and near Pirgos (Sperling ( 1942 ) 85 ) have been suggested: Pirgos is more likely because Classical remains have been found there but not at Ag. Ioannis (Pirgos: BCH 108 ( 1984 ) Chron . 770 and McDonald and Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 320 -21 no. 717 ; Ag. Ioannis: ibid. 302 -3 no. 306 ). It is described as a (perioikic) polis in the political sense at Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 23 , 30 . The external collective city-ethnic is used on a C6s dedication at Olympia (Siewert ( 1991 ) no. 9 ), and by Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 25 and 4 . 2 . 16 ((r 394 ) for a military contingent). When Letrinoi became perioikic is not known: it was certainly perioikic by the Eleian-Spartan war of c. 400 . It then became independent (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 25 , 30 ) and probably joined the Peloponnesian League, sending troops ( sphendonetai ) to support Sparta (no. 345 ) in 394 (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ). Elis probably recovered it by c. 362 (cf. Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 2 with Tuplin ( 1993 ) 183 -85 ). Paus. 6 . 22 . 8 says that it was originally a polisma , but in his day had only a few buildings with a temple and statue of Artemis Alpheiaia. According to Lyc. Alex . 53 -55 , the bones of Pelops were at Letrina. Letreus, son of Pelops, was oecist of Letrinoi (Paus. 6 . 22 . 8 )."
259,Marganeis (Marganeus),Elis,,,385,1734,"259 . Marganeis (Marganeus) Map 58 . At or near lat. 21 . 30 , long. 37 . 40 . Size of territory: unknown, presumably 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Μαργανεῖς (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 14 ) or Μάργανα (Diod. 15 . 77 . 4 ), and the same site is probably meant by Μαργάλαι (MS at Strabo 8 . 3 . 24 ) and Μάργαια (Steph. Byz. 432 . 11 -12 ). The city-ethnic is Μαργανευacuteς (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 25 ). It was apparently near Olympia (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 14 ). A location between modern Floka and Strefi west of Olympia has been suggested ( KlPauly iii. 1020 ), but the site with Classical material at Salmoni (formerly Koukoura) (McDonald and Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 304 -5 no. 308 : see also ibid. 320 -21 no. 722 ) would suit well. It is called a (perioikic) polis in the political sense at Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 23 -25 , 30 . The external collective use of the city-ethnic is found in Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 25 , 4 . 2 . 16 . When Marganeis became perioikic is not known: it was certainly perioikic by the Eleian-Spartan war of c. 400 , after which it became independent (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 25 , 30 ). It then probably joined the Peloponnesian League. It sent troops to support Sparta (no. 345 ) in 394 (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ). In 371 / 0 Elis (no. 251 ) claimed that Marganeis should belong to Elis (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 2 ); it was Eleian by 365 , when it was captured by Arkadia (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 14 ; Diod. 15 . 77 . 4 ), but was soon recaptured by Elis (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 26 ). It was probably fortified; Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 14 notes that it was captured because of treachery, and Strabo 8 . 3 . 24 says that it was not a natural stronghold, implying man-made defences. In Strabo's day (ibid.) it was part of Amphidolia (no. 247 )."
260,(Metapioi),Elis,,,161,883,"260 . (Metapioi) Map 58 . Unlocated, not in Barr . Type: B. The toponym is not attested. The city-ethnic is Μετάπιος , known only from IvO 10 ( c. 475 -450 ), where the collective and external use is attested in a 50 -year treaty of friendship with the equally unknown Anaitoi (no. 248 ) (cf. Minon ( 1994 ) no. 10 ; Staatsverträge 111 ). Since the treaty is in Eleian dialect,both Anaitoi and Metapioi presumably belong to the region of Elis, but may have been located anywhere in the region, either within the Eleian state proper or in perioikic territory north or south of the river Alpheios. The collective use of the city-ethnic and the capacity to enter into a treaty with another community strongly suggest that the Metapioi were a polis . On the difficulty of identifying the Classical community with the Mycenaean Me-ta-pa, see Roy ( 1997 ) 313 -14 . Cf. Anaitoi (no. 248 )."
261,Opous (Opountios),Elis,,,170,799,"261 . Opous (Opountios) Map 58 . Unlocated. Type: B. The toponym is ' Οπουacuteς (Diod. 14 . 17 . 8 ), also ' Οφιουtildeς ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) ii . 128 ). The city-ethnic is ' Οπουacuteντιος ( IG v . 2 368 . 135 -7 (C3 )). It was a perioikic community, perhaps to be identified with the ruins of an ancient acropolis at Gartsiko ( KlPauly iv. 323 no. 2 ). It is described as a polis (in a political sense) of the Akroreians c. 400 (Diod. 14 . 17 . 8 ); Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 14 refers collectively to the poleis of the Akroreians in 365 , without naming Opous. There were two Opountian proxenoi at Kleitor in Arkadia at a date before 221 ( IG v . 2 368 . 135 -37 ). Strabo 9 . 4 . 2 regarded Opous as insignificant, but noted that it renewed its kinship with the Opuntian Lokrians ( supra , on Akroreia)."
262,Pisa (Pisatas),Elis,,,1190,6104,"262 . Pisa (Pisatas) Map 58 . Unlocated. Type: B (in c. 365 -362 ). The toponym is Πίσα , ηasper (Ringel et al . ( 1999 ) a + c line 7 ( 365 -362 ); Pind. Ol . 1 . 18 ). The city-ethnic is Πισάτας ( IvO 36 = DGE 422 ( 365 -362 ); Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 28 ). It seems clear that in the Archaic period Elis struggled with an independent community Pisa; the ethnic Πισαῖος is often used of it (e.g. Paus. 6 . 22 . 4 ), and Stesichoros (fr. 86 , Page = Strabo 8 . 3 . 31 , on which see Hansen ( 1998 ) 124 -32 ) called it a polis ; in its territory lay Olympia (where one of its own citizens was victorious in 724 , according to Paus. 5 . 8 . 6 = Olympionikai 15 ), and it struggled with Elis for control of Olympia and of Pisatan territory generally. Elis eventually prevailed-perhaps c. 570 -and incorporated Pisatan territory into the Eleian state. Because reports of these events are distorted by later interests (Sordi ( 1994 )), little is known about the Archaic Pisatan state save that its rulers were remembered as kings or tyrants (on early Pisatan history, see RE xx. 1746 -53 ). Pisa later broke away from Eleian control, and again formed an independent, or at least selfgoverning, state 365 -c. 362 , but was then reabsorbed into the Eleian state. It merits inclusion in this Inventory primarily because it was quite possibly a polis in 365 -c. 362 . No source explicitly calls it a polis , but the internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found in IvO 36 = DGE 422 ( 365 -362 ) and the external collective use in Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 28 ; it issued coins and conducted a foreign policy ( infra ). However, several points should be borne in mind when assessing the form taken by the independent Pisatan state of 365 -c. 362 . First, there is no reason to believe in the existence of a town Pisa ( infra ). Secondly, there were other towns in Classical Pisatis: Alasyaion (no. 245 ) is included in this Inventory, and Harpina,Herakleia and Salmone are listed above among the settlements not included, but a strong case can be made that yet other towns also existed in Classical Pisatis (Roy ( 2002 a )). According to the criteria used in the present work to determine whether a community should be included, only Alasyaion merits inclusion: but the evidence on towns in Pisatis is such that there is a real possibility that several Pisatan towns were poleis in the Classical period (Roy ( 2002 a )). If there were such poleis , then presumably during the Classical period, except for the period 365 -c. 362 , they were subordinate poleis within the territory of Elis (cf. the cases of Kyllene (no. 254 ) and Pylos (no. 263 ), both within Elis but not in Pisatis). In that case the towns could have been subordinate poleis of Pisatis in 365 -c. 362 . Alternatively, the independent state of Pisatis may have been not a polis , but a confederacy of several small poleis : in the limited surviving evidence there is no indication of a federal structure, but equally nothing to exclude it. Thus Pisatis in 365 -c. 362 may have been ( 1 ) a polis with no central town Pisa but with several towns not of polis status within its territory; or ( 2 ) a polis with no central town Pisa but with several subordinate poleis within its territory; or ( 3 ) not a polis but a confederacy uniting several small poleis . Despite this last possibility, Pisa is here included in the Inventory of poleis because its status as a polis is likely; but, if in fact a polis , it may have had a somewhat anomalous composition. The extent of the territory of the independent Pisatan state is unknown, but presumably included some or all of the supposed eight poleis of Pisatis (see the Introduction and Alasyaion (no. 245 ) in this Inventory). Despite ancient attempts to argue for a town Pisa (countered by Apollodoros in Strabo 8 . 3 . 31 ), there is no reliable evidence, literary or archaeological, for a town of that name, and no reason to believe in it ( KlPauly iv. 866 -67 ). Pisa's claim to Olympia was still remembered c. 400 (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 31 , where the other claimants, besides the Eleians, must be Pisatan).When war broke out between Arkadia and Elis (no. 251 ) in 365 , the Arkadians occupied various pieces of Eleian territory (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 14 ), including Pisa, which became an independent state.It was probably a puppet-state of the Arkadians: the Arkadians were able to draw on Olympic treasures (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 33 -34 ; Diod. 15 . 82 . 1 ), as the Pisatans themselves may have done for their gold coinage, and it was often said that the Olympic Games of 364 , regarded as a non-Olympiad by the Eleians (Diod. 15 . 78 . 3 ), were held by the Pisatans and the Arkadians (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 28 -29 ; Diod. 15 . 82 . 1 ; Paus. 6 . 4 . 2 ) or even by the Arkadians alone (Paus. 6 . 8 . 3 , 6 . 22 . 3 ; cf. Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 35 ). The Pisatan state none the less appears to have had the forms of an independent state. It is not heard of again after the battle of Mantinea in 362 , and presumably rapidly returned to Elis, which had regained control of Olympia before the Olympic Games of 360 . Pisa made treaties with Arkadia and Akroreia and with Messenia and Sikyon (no. 228 ) (Ringel et al . ( 1999 )). A Pisatan decree ( IvO 36 = DGE 422 ) appointed two Sikyonians proxenoi and theorodokoi : the decree was dated by three eponymous Pisatan hellanodikai (not noted in Sherk ( 1990 b )). Pisa minted gold coins bearing the head of Zeus and with the legend ΠΙΣΑ (Head, HN ² 426 ). Pisa held the Olympic Games of 364 (Diod. 15 . 78 . 2 -3 ), though (as noted supra ) Arkadia was often said to have been involved in organising the games. It is clear that for a brief period Pisa discharged typical functions of an independent Greek state, and can be regarded as such, even if it was probably in fact a puppetstate of the Arkadian federation. Pisos was founder of Pisa ( RE xx. 1806 no. 1 ). The genealogical claim that Olympia, consort of Pisos, was a daughter of Arkas ( Etym. Magn . s.v. Olympia) may be an attempt, from the period of Pisatan independence, to connect Pisa and Arkadia."
263,Pylos (Pylios),Elis,21.3,37.55,297,1561,"263 . Pylos (Pylios) Map 58 . Lat. 21 . 30 , long. 37 . 55 . Size of territory: unknown, presumably 1 or 2 . Type: C. The toponym is Πυacuteλος , οasper (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 16 ; Strabo 8 . 3 . 7 ). The city-ethnic is Πυacuteλιος (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 26 ). The only evidence which suggests that Pylos may have been a polis is the use of a collective ethnic twice in a single passage by Xenophon ( Hell . 7 . 4 . 26 ), but it is notable that Xenophon appears to include in the 'Pylians' both Eleian exiles and non-Eleian foreigners, though possibly through imprecision in the narrative. There was ancient confusion about the location because of the desire to identify Homeric Pylos, and the existence of other sites called Pylos in the western Peloponnese ( RE xxiii. 2131 -33 no. 3 ). The site at modern Armatova near Agrapidokhori, which has been thoroughly excavated (Coleman ( 1986 )), is very probably Pylos. Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 16 (r 365 ) says that Eleian exiles seized Pylos and were joined by many of the Eleian demos because it was a chorion kalon ; the Eleians captured the Pylians and their chorion (ibid. 26 ). The excavation has shown a significant Classical nucleated settlement from c. 425 , but without monumental architecture of any kind: communal buildings, if any, must have been of the same character as the houses (Coleman ( 1986 ) 67 ). The archaeological findings are compatible with destruction in the 360 s. Pylos was reputedly founded by the Megarian Pylon, then destroyed by Herakles, and refounded by the Eleians (Paus. 6 . 22 . 5 )."
264,Thraistos (Thraistios),Elis,,,232,1172,"264 . Thraistos (Thraistios) Map 58 . Unlocated. Type: A. The toponym is Θραῖστος or Θραῖστον (Diod. 14 . 17 . 8 ), but Θραυtildeστος or Θραυtildeστον in Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 14 . The city-ethnic is Θραίστιος ( IG ix . 1²138 (C4e)). Thraistos was an Akroreian community, and therefore perioikic, but is not more precisely located. It is described as a polis of the Akroreians (either as a town or as a political community) in 365 by Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 14 . The external collective use of the city-ethnic is found in IG ix . 1² 138 (C4e). It sent judges to Kalydon (no. 148 ) in Aitolia, probably in C4e ( IG ix . 1² 138 ), because the inscription is dated by two sets of eponymous officials, the second set (two damonomoi ) are likely to have been officials of Thraistos (Sherk ( 1990 a ) 260 ). Unlike the other Akroreian poleis , Thraistos was not captured by the Arkadians in 365 (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 14 ); it is therefore unknown whether it formed part of the Akroreian state of 365 -c. 362 . Its own particular history is not otherwise known: it will have shared the fate of the Akroreians (see Introduction). On Thraistos, see Nielsen ( 1995 ) 93 . ## II. The Poleis"
265,Alea (Aleos),Arkadia,37.5,22.25,833,4061,"265 . Alea (Aleos) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 50 , long. 22 . 25 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: B. The toponym is Αλέα , ηasper ( IG iv . 1² 103 . 45 (C4m); SEG 23 189 ( c. 330 )). The city-ethnic is Αλεός ( IG i³ 80 ( 421 )); IvO 30 (C5s-C4f) has Αλειός (cf. Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 118 ); Classical coins use the form Αλεάτας (often abbreviated) in the legends ( infra ; cf. Roy ( 1972 a ) 331 ). There is no certain attestation of polis in references to Alea, but Theopomp. fr. 242 ( = Steph. Byz. 69 . 20 ) may have classed Alea as a polis (cf. Whitehead ( 1994 ) 119 ), and the πόλις τῶν Αλειῶν of IvO 295 ( c. 275 -250 ) is probably our city (cf. Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 118 ). The collective use of the ethnic is attested internally in Classical coin legends ( infra ; cf. Roy ( 1972 a ) 331 ) and externally in IvO 30 (C5s-C4f), for which see Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 118 . The individual use is found externally on IG i³ 80 ( 421 ). The territory occupied c. 110 km ² . ⁵ There is a temple(?) at Anemomilo, in the pass leading to Orchomenos (no. 286 ); with it are associated Classical sherds (Meyer ( 1939 a ) 29 ; Jost ( 1985 ) 108 ). It may be assumed that Alea was a member both of the Peloponnesian League (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 87 ) and the Arkadian Confederacy (ibid. 94 -95 ). IG iv . 1² 103 . 45 (C4m) records a payment of εφόδια to two people ες Αλέαν , and the presumption is that Alea received an embassy from Epidauros (no. 348 ). IvO 30 (C5s-C4f) is a grant of proxenia by Alea to an Athenian (cf. Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 118 ), and IG i³ 80 ( 421 ) is a grant by Athens (no. 361 ) of proxenia to a man of Alea; SEG 23 189 . 25 ( c. 330 ) records an Argive theorodokos in Alea. IvO 30 (C5s-C4f), a grant of proxenia , is the oldest known public enactment of Alea; from its enactment formula ( έδοξε Αλειοῖς ) the existence of an assembly may be inferred, but otherwise the political institutions of the city are unknown. The well-preserved walls of Alea are probably C3 (Meyer ( 1939 a ) 26 ). The acropolis measured 14 . 3 ha, and on it was a building which Meyer identified as a military barracks. The city below the 'Stadtberg' occupied 14 . 6 ha; no substantial remains are extant, but scattered remains seem to be of houses.See Meyer ( 1939 a ) 19 -29 ; Papachatzis ( 1994 ) 265 -66 . Head, HN ² 446 dates the first coinage of Alea to c. 430 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 3 . 630 proposes 421 . The legend abbreviates the ethnic Αλεάτας (Roy ( 1972 a ) 331 ) to ΑΛ , ΑΛΕ , ΑΛΕΑ ; Lacroix ( 1968 ) 325 n. 4 cites the legend ΑΛΕ [ Α ] ΤΑΝ (C4 according to Jost ( 1985 ) 526 ). The types show Artemis (Babelon, Traité ii. 3 nos. 946 -49 ), Athena ⁵ Most of the territorial sizes given in this Inventory are based on the map in Jost ( 1985 ); on this map Jost has indicated the probable borders of the major poleis . She comments: 'Il va de soi que les limites . . . sont approximatives: elles marquent la zone frontalière dont seuls quelques points . . . sont assurés.' It may be added that these points are most often known from Pausanias,and so the borders indicated reflect the Roman period. In general, there is no way of knowing whether this corresponds to Archaic and Classical conditions,a problem further complicated by the fact that we do have information which indicates that borders could fluctuate even within the Archaic and Classical periods (Nielsen ( 1996 b ) 181 ). So the territorial sizes given here are merely educated guesses. (ibid. no. 950 ), Herakles (ibid. no. 951 ) and Helios (Lacroix ( 1968 ) 325 n. 4 ). Both bronze and silver coins are known. Denominations are triobol (Babelon, Traité ii. 3 no. 951 ), obol (ibid. no. 946 ), and tritartemorion (ibid. no. 947 ). SNG Cop. Argolis 213 -14 . Alean coins seem to indicate cults of Athena Alea and Artemis (Jost ( 1985 ) 107 -9 ). Alea may have consulted the oracle at Delphi before 300 (cf. Paus. 8 . 23 . 1 with Fontenrose ( 1978 ) 353 ); IvO 295 ( c. 275 -250 ) is probably an Alean dedication, and IvO 30 (C5s-C4f), although an Alean document (cf. Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 118 ), was put up at Olympia."
266,Alipheira (Alipheireus),Arkadia,37.35,21.5,535,2554,"266 . Alipheira (Alipheireus) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 21 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 -3 . Type: C. The toponym is Αλίφειρα , ηasper (Polyb. 4 . 78 . 3 ; SEG 25 448 . 15 (C3s)), or Αλίφηρα (Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 ). The city-ethnic is Αλιφειρευacuteς (Polyb. 4 . 77 . 10 ; SEG 25 449 . 2 (C2 )) or Αλιφηρευacuteς ( CIG 1936 (Hell.); Paus. 8 . 27 . 7 ); see Orlandos ( 1967 -68 ) 9 -10 . Alipheira is well attested only in Heltic sources, where it is called a polis both in the urban sense (Polyb. 4 . 78 . 11 (r 219 )) and in the political sense ( SEG 25 447 . 9 (C3 )). Since Alipheira certainly existed before C3 ( infra ), the city may possibly have been a polis . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in SEG 25 449 (C2f) and externally in Polyb. 4 . 77 . 10 and IvO 48 (C2 ); the external individual use is found in CIG 1936 (Hell.). The territory covered c. 100 km ² ; SEG 25 449 (C2f) has been interpreted as a demarcation of the border of Alipheira. According to Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 , Alipheira was in 371 a part of the tribal state of the Kynourians (Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 132 -34 , 140 -41 ), and it can be inferred from a combination of IG v . 2 1 . 40 ( 360 s) and Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 (r 371 ) (with Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 132 -34 ) that the city was a member of the Arkadian Confederacy. Membership of the Peloponnesian League may also be assumed (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 87 ). According to Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 , Alipheira was one of the cities that the Arkadian Confederacy had voted to incorporate into Megalopolis (no. 282 ); whether this decision was implemented is not certain.According to Paus. 8 . 26 . 5 , a part of the population actually relocated to Megalopolis, but the city was not abandoned.In C3 Alipheira was, at least sometimes, controlled by Megalopolis (Polyb. 4 . 77 . 10 ); but it also appears as a polis ( SEG 25 447 ). Alipheira was centred on a hill rising to 686 m above sea level. The hill measures 800 × 65 m and was fortified before 370 (Orlandos ( 1967 -68 ) 32 ). The city proper seems to have lain outside these walls and to have occupied the area north-east of the acropolis (ibid. 41 ). The lower city too was fortified (Pritchett ( 1989 ) 44 , no dates). In the eastern part of the acropolis was the sanctuary of Athena, with a temple constructed c. 500 -490 ; votives go back to C6m (Jost ( 1985 ) 80 ). In addition to the temple, the sanctuary included a colossal statue of Athena dating to C5 (ibid. 81 ). In the north-western part of the hill was a sanctuary of Asklepios with a C4s temple (ibid. 81 )."
267,Asea (Aseates),Arkadia,37.25,22.2,870,4278,"267 . Asea (Aseates) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 25 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Ασέα , ηasper (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 15 ); in the great Delphic catalogue of theorodokoi ( c. 230 -210 ) we find the entry εν Ασέωι , but this form is unique ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 9 ). The city-ethnic is ΑΣΕΑΤΑΝ on the Achaian federal bronze coinage of the city (Head, HN ² 418 ( c. 190 s)); this enables us to emend the αθεαtildeται / ασθεαtildeται of the MSS at Xen. Hell . 7 . 5 . 5 to Ασεαtildeται . Asea is classified as a polis in the territorial sense (with the political sense as a possible connotation) at Xen. Hell . 7 . 5 . 5 , a passage that also provides an instance of the external collective use of the city-ethnic. Strabo 8 . 3 . 12 classifies Asea as a κώ µ η τηtildeς Μεγαλοπολιτίδος , but the reference is to C1 . The territory is implicitly referred to at Xen. Hell . 7 . 5 . 5 as polis (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 72 -73 ). The size of the territory has been estimated at c. 60 km ² by Forsén and Forsén ( 1997 ) 175 . The city of Asea was not the only place of habitation: Forsén and Forsén ( 1997 ) 173 report that they have found between twenty and thirty sites dating from the Archaic to the Heltic periods in the chora . Some of these were presumably isolated farmsteads, but at least four seem to have been small villages connected with sanctuaries: one is situated only 1 . 5 km from the Vigla temple, while another was probably situated close to a temple of Athena of which Forsén and Forsén have found scattered architectural remains dating to C4 ; in addition, two other sites may have been villages and one of these was possibly also connected with a sanctuary (Forsén and Forsén ( 1997 ) 172 -74 ). Two important temples have been excavated in the territory of Asea. (a) At Vigla, on the border with Pallantion (no. 289 ) (Forsén and Forsén ( 1997 ) 170 ), is a temple dedicated to Athena and Poseidon; it is dated to C6 (Østby ( 1995 b ) 348 -50 ). This temple was preceded by a smaller temple built of wood and clay c. 630 -620 (Voyatzis ( 1990 ) 34 ). (b) At Ag. Elias, on the border with (presumably) Peraitheis, a large temple dates from c. 500 (Forsén et al . ( 1999 )). Forsén and Forsén ( 1997 ) 176 estimate that the urban population could have been max. 2 , 000 -3 , 000 . The total population of the polis is estimated at 2 , 500 -3 , 500 at the most. It is impossible to give any estimate of the number of adult male citizens. Asea was a Mainalian city (Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 ; Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 132 -34 ). Membership of the Arkadian Confederacy can be assumed,both on the basis of Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 11 , where the city is described as the rallying place of the federal army in 370 , and because the Mainalians as such were members of the Confederacy ( IG v . 2 1 . 16 ( 360 s)); membership of the Peloponnesian League may also be assumed,probably mediated by the Mainalian tribal state (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 87 , 100 ). According to Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 , Asea was among the communities that the Arkadian Confederacy voted to relocate to Megalopolis (no. 282 ); however,it is not known whether this relocation was ever wholly or partly carried out (Moggi ( 1974 ) 87 -88 ). Asea was centred on a fortified acropolis rising to 54 m and measuring 240 × 120 m. The fortification may be C4e (Forsén and Forsén ( 1997 ) 169 ; Forsén et al . ( 2002 ) 96 ); Forsén et al . ( 2002 ) 100 suggest that a temple was erected on the acropolis during the late Archaic-Classical (?) period. The lower city was fortified too,but the wall here seems to be later than the acropolis wall, probably C3 (Forsén et al . ( 2002 ) 96 ; Forsén and Forsén ( 1997 ) 167 -68 ; Holmberg ( 1944 ) 132 -42 ); it probably enclosed all of the lower city. Forsén and Forsén ( 1997 ) 166 -67 and Forsén et al . ( 2002 ) 100 -2 report that they found Archaic and Classical pottery around the acropolis, and that the area yielding finds was at least 13 ha, but perhaps twice as large (the eastern area of the site having been covered with alluvium brought down by the river Alpheios). The area inside the lower wall was built up for habitation; some of the houses contained Heltic finds, but others contained nothing and may possibly be older (Forsén and Forsén ( 1997 ) 169 )."
268,Dipaia (Dipaeus),Arkadia,,,545,2540,"268 . Dipaia (Dipaeus) Map 58 . Not securely located, but it is clear from Paus. 8 . 30 . 1 that Dipaia must have been situated in the upper Helisson valley; it is probably to be identified with the ancient remains near Davia (Jost ( 1973 ) pl. 9 . 1 -3 ; Pikoulas ( 1992 -93 ) 204 ; Pikoulas ( 1999 c ) 126 ): lat. 37 . 20 , long. 22 . 15 . Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is the plural of the ethnic at Hdt. 9 . 35 . 2 ( εν ∆ιπαιευtildeσι ; cf. the comment by Steph. Byz. 234 . 14 -15 ), but at Isoc. 6 . 99 we find ∆ίπαια , ηasper . The city-ethnic is ∆ιπαευacuteς in SEG 23 179 (C4f); at Paus. 6 . 7 . 9 ∆ιπαιευacuteς is an emendation of ∆ιπεευacuteς ; Paus. 8 . 30 . 1 has ∆ιπαιευacuteς , and the C2 coinage of the city uses the legend ∆ΙΠΑΙΕΩΝ (Head, HN ² 418 ). At 8 . 27 . 3 (r 371 ) Pausanias retrospectively lists Dipaia as a polis , and at 3 . 11 . 7 (rC5f) it is classified as a polisma . The collective use of the ethnic is attested externally in Hdt. 9 . 35 . 2 and on SEG 23 179 (C4f); the individual use of the ethnic is attested externally at Paus. 6 . 7 . 9 (r 440 ) ( Olympionikai 314 ). The name of the territory is unknown; Paus. 8 . 30 . 1 refers to it, contemporaneously, as ηasper ∆ιπαιέων χώρα . In the 460 s an apparently major battle was fought near Dipaia between Sparta (no. 345 ) and an Arkadian alliance (Hdt. 9 . 35 . 2 ; Isoc. 6 . 99 ). A C4f inscription ( SEG 23 179 ) mentions the ∆ιπαεές ; the nature of the inscription is not clear, but Bradeen ( 1966 ) 321 thinks that it is a fragment of a record of a judgment by a foreign board of arbitration in a dispute involving the city of Dipaia.Dipaia was a Mainalian city (Paus. 3 . 11 . 7 , 6 . 7 . 9 , 8 . 27 . 3 ; for the last passage, see Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 132 -34 ), but this is the only explicitly attested membership of a larger organisation; however, membership of the Arkadian Confederacy can be inferred from a combination of Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 (r 271 ) and IG v . 2 1 . 16 ( 360 s; see further Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 95 -96 , 100 -1 ), and membership of the Peloponnesian League may be assumed (ibid. 87 ). According to Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 (r 371 ), Dipaia was among the communities that the Arkadian Confederacy voted to relocate to Megalopolis (no. 282 ); however, it is unknown whether this decision was implemented (Moggi ( 1974 ) 83 -84 ). If Dipaia is to be identified with the remains at Davia ( supra ), then the city was centred on a fortified acropolis. In C5m, c. 440 according to Olympionikai 314 , Dipaia produced an Olympic victor."
269,Euaimon (Euaimnios),Arkadia,,,315,1507,"269 . Euaimon (Euaimnios) Unlocated (but see Howell ( 1970 ) 82 ). Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is Ευαί µ ων ( IG V. 2 343 = IPArk no. 15 . 7 , 49 -50 (C4m); Steph. Byz. 283 . 14 ). The city-ethnic is Ευαί µ νιος ( IG v . 2 343 = IPArk no. 15 . 3 (C4m)). No Archaic or Classical source describes Euaimon as a polis , though Theopomp.fr. 61 ( = Steph.Byz. 283 . 14 -15 ) may have done so (Whitehead ( 1994 ) 119 ; Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 71 ); IG v . 2 343 = IPArk no. 15 is a treaty between Euaimon and Orchomenos (no. 286 ), concluded επιgrave τοῖς ΓaltίσΓaltοις καιgrave τοῖς υasper µ οίοις (ll. 4 -6 ), and the nature of the document thus suggests that Euaimon was a polis ; Dubois ( 1986 ) 148 , 159 proposes to restore [ ιν πόλι Γaltε ] κατέραι in ll. 56 -57 . The same treaty uses the collective ethnic to refer to the community of Euaimon ( 2 -3 , 53 -54 , 75 -76 , 83 ). The treaty IPArk no. 15 . 2 describes itself as an agreement of συΓaltοικία and provides for the inclusion of the Euaiminians into the Orchomenian citizen body ( IPArk p. 135 ); however, Euaimon probably continued to exist (cf. Steph. Byz. 283 . 14 -15 ; Du˘ sani´ c ( 1978 ) 338 ; Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 71 ), and may thereafter have been a dependent polis of Orchomenos. In IPArk no. 15 . 6 -7 , ταgrave δεgrave ιasperεραgrave ταgrave ιν Ευαί µ ονι is presumably a reference to communal cults in Euaimon which were to be preserved after the agreement,but the local pantheon is otherwise unknown (Jost ( 1985 ) 115 , 120 )."
270,Eutaia,Arkadia,37.2,22.2,440,2179,"270 . Eutaia Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 20 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. The MSS of Xen. Hell . (at 6 . 5 . 12 , 21 ) vary between Ευacuteταια , Ευγαία and Ευγέα , ηasper (Tuplin ( 1986 ) 27 -28 ); since later sources such as Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 and Steph. Byz. 287 . 19 use the τ -form,this form has become customary in scholarly literature. At Hell . 6 . 5 . 12 Xenophon uses polis three times about Eutaia, presumably primarily in the sense of town, although the meaning 'territory' may be a connotation in the phrase πόλιν οasperacute µ ορον ουtildeσαν and 'political community' in ουκ ηδίκησε τηgraveν πόλιν . The name of the territory is unknown, but the territory is probably referred to as polis by Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 12 . T o the south Eutaia bordered on Lakonia (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 12 ). Eutaia was a Mainalian city (Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 ; Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 132 -34 ). Membership of the Arkadian Confederacy is proved by Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 12 ; membership was probably mediated by the tribal state of the Mainalians (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 95 ). Membership of the Peloponnesian League may be assumed (ibid. 87 ). According to Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 , Eutaia was among the communities that the Arkadian Confederacy voted to relocate to Megalopolis (no. 282 ). It is unknown whether the relocation was ever carried out: the site seems not to have been abandoned, since coins of the Arkadian and Achaian Confederacies have been found there (Loring ( 1895 ) 50 ; Pikoulas ( 1988 ) 70 -73 ). At Hell . 6 . 5 . 12 , Xenophon mentions that in 370 Eutaia raised troops, which were put under the command of the Arkadian Confederacy. Eutaia was located at modern Lianos; the site has not been excavated. Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 12 mentions οικίαι , and Loring ( 1895 ) 50 as well as Pikoulas ( 1988 ) report numerous antiquities at Lianos; Pikoulas ( 1988 ) reports an abundance of sherds and minor architectural fragments in the fields. At Hell . 6 . 5 . 12 Xenophon mentions a τεῖχος . The reference may be to the poor fortification found on the hill of Agios Konstantinos which overlooks the site (Pikoulas ( 1988 ) 75 ). If so, the lower city proper was possibly unfortified."
271,Gortys (Kortynios),Arkadia,37.3,22.2,714,3678,"271 . Gortys (Kortynios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 30 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: probably 2 or 3 . Type: B. The toponym is Κόρτυς , ηasper (Hsch. s.v. Κορτυacuteνιοι ) or Γόρτυς , -υνος , ηasper (Pl. Leg . 708 A); Paus. 5 . 7 . 1 and Hsch. s.v. ' Εκατο µ βαῖος have Γόρτυνα , -ης , ηasper . The city-ethnic is Κορτυacuteνιος ( Syll . ³ 49 (C5f)); ΚΟΡΤΥΝΕΩΝ from * Κορτυνευacuteς is found on C2 coins (Dubois ( 1986 ) 287 ). The only source that classifies Gortys as a polis is Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 (r 371 ) and 28 . 1 ( κώ µ η ταgrave επ ' ε µ ουtilde , ταgrave δεgrave έτι αρχαιότερα πόλις ), but the external collective use of the city-ethnic is found on a C5f dedication of spoils at Delphi ( Syll . ³ 49 ). The ethnic is attested as a personal name already in C6 (Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 122 ). Gortys was a Kynourian community (Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 ; Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 132 -34 ). Membership of the Peloponnesian League can be assumed (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 87 ); membership of the Arkadian Confederacy is proved by a combination of IG v . 2 1 . 40 ( 360 s) and Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 (Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 132 -34 ). According to Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 , Gortys was among the communities that the Arkadian Confederacy voted to relocate to Megalopolis (no. 282 ). It is, however, unknown whether this decision was implemented, and the site seems not to have been abandoned (Moggi ( 1974 ) 91 -92 ). C5f military activity by Gortys can be inferred from Syll . ³ 49 ( Κορτυacuteνιοι δεκάταν πολε µ ίον ), a dedication of spoils set up at Delphi. The site of Gortys is situated on the western bank of the river Lousios/Gortynios near the modern village of Atsicholo. It is dominated by two sanctuaries: an upper sanctuary with a fortified 'acropolis'and a lower sanctuary. The upper sanctuary was dedicated to Asklepios and contains a C4e stoa (Jost ( 1985 ) 204 ), a C5l-C4e fountain house (ibid.), and a C5l-C4e prostyle Doric temple (ibid.). The acropolis measures 425 × 160 / 100 m.The fortifications were constructed entirely in local stone, at least some of which was quarried on the acropolis itself (Martin ( 1947 -48 ) 112 ). In general, archaeology points to a date after 370 for the fortifications. Martin ( 1947 -48 ) 139 believes that the fortifications were erected by Megalopolis/the Arkadian Confederacy as a military outpost protecting Megalopolitan territory; a large number of C4 Arkadian federal coins have been found on the acropolis (ibid.), pointing to a C4m date for the fortifications. Furthermore, there are no remains on the acropolis linking the fortifications to the city of Gortys (Martin ( 1947 -48 ) 142 ). If Martin is right, this is not really the acropolis of Gortys, but a military fort; this interpretation is accepted by Jost ( 1999 ) 197 , but the fortification may also have served the local population, turning Gortys into a settlement of the ville acropole type described by Jost ( 1999 ) 193 -98 . The lower sanctuary lay 500 m north of the acropolis, and the residential area was presumably situated between the two sanctuaries ( BCH 79 ( 1955 ) 335 ): at least one house excavated there dates to C4 ( BCH 80 ( 1956 ) 402 ), but in contrast to the sanctuaries, the city proper is not well known, and no sketch of it can be given (for a plan, see Papachatzis ( 1994 ) 298 ). The lower sanctuary was likewise dedicated to Asklepios and contains a stoa of, possibly, C4 ( BCH 79 ( 1955 ) 340 ), a C4s bath (Jost ( 1985 ) 205 ) and a large temple, laid out c. 370 but apparently never finished (ibid. 206 -7 ). There is no obvious explanation for the existence of two Asklepieia,and apart from Asklepios the local pantheon is not well known (ibid. 202 -3 , 205 )."
272,Halous,Arkadia,37.45,22.0,233,1160,"272 . Halous Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 45 , long. 22 . 00 . Size of territory: probably 2 or 3 . Type: C. The toponym is Αasperλουtildeς (-ουtildeντος ), οasper at Paus. 8 . 25 . 2 ; the entry εν h αλέιος in the Delphic catalogue of theorodokoi of C5l-C4e (ed. by Daux in REG 62 ( 1949 ) p. 6 l. 10 ) may refer to this site, using an older form of the toponym (Daux ad loc . and Meyer ( 1957 a ) 86 ). The city deserves inclusion in this Inventory only because it may have had a Delphic theorodokos in C5l-C4e ( supra ), and thus was possibly a polis (Perlman ( 1995 ) 116 , 121 , 135 ). Meyer ( 1939 a ) 78 -83 identified Halous with the Palaiokastro at Syriamou, south-west of Thaliades (no. 299 ). The site consists of a small walled hill with the habitation area, unwalled, below. The wall runs for c. 640 m and encloses an area of 1 . 7 ha; it dates from C4 , according to Meyer; sherds and tiles from the walled area date to the Classical and Heltic periods. In the habitation area outside the wall Meyer made 'massenhaften Ziegel- und Scherbefunde' .The inhabited area was considerable, according to Meyer, but he does not estimate the size of the city proper."
273,Helisson (Heliswasios),Arkadia,37.35,22.15,818,3771,"273 . Helisson (Heliswasios) Map 58 (not precisely located; cf. Bölte ( 1913 a ); Pikoulas ( 1992 -93 ) 204 , ( 1999 c ) 125 -26 ). Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 22 . 15 . Size of territory: probably 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is ' Ελισόντι in SEG 37 340 . 9 -10 (C4f), which points to the nominative ' Ελισ ( σ ) ουtildeς or ' Ελισ ( σ ) ῶν (&lt; ' ΕλισΓalt -), οasper , for which see te Riele ( 1987 ) 171 -72 and Dubois ( 1988 ) 289 ; Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 (r 371 ) has ' Ελισσών and Diod. 16 . 39 . 5 (r 352 ) ' Ελισ ( σ ) ουtildeς . The cityethnic is ' ΕλισΓaltάσιος in SEG 37 340 ; it is later written ' Ελισφάσιος ( IG iv² . 1 42 . 2 , 16 -17 ( c. 300 ); Polyb. 11 . 11 . 6 ); see Dubois ( 1988 ) 288 . Helisson is called polis in the urban sense by SEG 37 340 . 6 -7 (C4f) and Diod. 16 . 39 . 5 (r 352 ), and in the political sense by SEG 37 340 . 5 (C4f). The individual use of the ethnic is unattested, but the collective use is found externally in SEG 37 340 (C4f), IG iv² . 1 42 . 2 ( c. 300 ) and in Polyb. 11 . 11 . 6 . The territory is referred to as χώρα by SEG 37 340 . 5 (C4f) and Polyb. 11 . 11 . 6 (r 207 ). Helisson was a Mainalian city (Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 (r 371 ); Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 132 -34 ), and it can be inferred from a combination of IG v . 2 1 . 16 ( 360 s) and Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 (r 371 ) (cf. Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 132 -34 ) that the city was a member of the Arkadian Confederacy. Membership of the Peloponnesian League may be assumed (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 87 ). In C4f, Helisson concluded a treaty with Mantinea (no. 281 ) ( SEG 37 340 ), whereby all citizens of Helisson became Mantinean citizens; the city of Helisson was left in existence as a κώ µ η of Mantinea, but continued to be a polis none the less ( SEG 37 340 . 6 -7 ); it is debatable whether Helisson was to survive as a polis merely in the urban sense (so Rhodes ( 1995 ) 97 ), or whether the city was constituted as a dependent polis within the Mantinike (so Hansen ( 1995 a ) 39 , ( 1995 b ) 73 -74 ; Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 67 -70 ). The treaty does not call itself a sympoliteia , but simply a συacuteνθεσις ( SEG 37 340 . 2 ); it has, however, become customary to refer to the agreement as a sympoliteia , for which concept see Hansen ( 1995 b ) 56 . After the treaty, Helisson-like the other dependencies of Mantinea-was entitled to send a thearos to the Mantinean board of thearoi ( 8 -9 : θεαροgraveν ηtildeναι εξ ' Ελισό [ ν ] τι κατάπερ ες ταῖς άλλαις πόλισι ). According to Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 (r 371 ), Helisson was among the communities that the Arkadian Confederacy voted to relocate to Megalopolis (no. 282 ); it is not known, however, whether this decision was implemented, and the city still existed in 352 , when it was captured and pillaged by the Spartans (Diod. 16 . 39 . 5 ). No theorodokos is attested for Helisson, but SEG 37 340 . 9 -10 : ταgraveς θεαρίας δέκεσθαι καgrave ταgrave πάτρια suggests that the city was connected to some system of theorodokia . By the treaty SEG 37 340 (C4f), Helisson adopted the Mantinean constitution and thus became a democracy (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 69 -70 ); it is, however, clear from the inscription (which among other things mentions a body of local laws, νό µ οι (l. 15 )) that Helisson had its own constitution before the agreement, although what form it took is unknown.The treaty is the only surviving public enactment of Helisson; at l. 17 it refers to a local board of επι µ εληταί (te Riele ( 1987 ) 180 ; Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 160 n. 56 ). The local pantheon is unknown, but in SEG 37 340 . 9 -10 ταgraveς θυσίας . . . ταgraveς ιν ' Ελισό [ ν ]/ τι is presumably a reference to local communal cults which were to be preserved after the unification of Helisson and Mantinea. For a C4 hero relief from Helisson, see Damaskos ( 1990 -91 )."
274,Heraia (Heraieus),Arkadia,37.35,21.5,1323,6396,"274 . Heraia (Heraieus) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 21 . 50 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Ηερ [ αί ] α in REG 62 ( 1949 ) p. 6 ll. 11 -12 (C5l-C4f); ' Ηραία , ηasper is found at Xen. Hell . 2 . 30 . 9 , 6 . 5 . 22 ; Ps.-Skylax 44 ; and IPArk no. 23 . 7 (C3 ). The city-ethnic is ' Εραευacuteς in SEG 11 1045 ( c. 500 ); IPArk no. 15 . 19 (C4m) and Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 11 have ' Ηραευacuteς ; Thuc. 5 . 67 . 1 and Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 22 have ' Ηραιευacuteς ; coins have ΗΡΑΕΩΝ (Babelon, Traité ii. 3 no. 1015 ). Heraia is listed as the third toponym after the heading πόλεις αιasper µ εγάλαι αιasperacuteδε (where polis is used in the urban sense) in Ps.-Skylax 44 ; at Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 it is implicitly described as a polis in the urban and territorial senses combined (for the idiom, cf. Diod. 2 . 43 . 6 and see Smyth, Greek Grammar § 1096 ); at Arist. Pol . 1303 a 15 -16 there is a reference to a change of politeia in Heraia, in a passage ( 1302 b 40 , 1303 a 15 ) where Heraia is listed as the fourth of six examples of the observation that a polis (in the political sense) consists of sometimes disproportionate parts.At Paus. 8 . 26 . 1 there is a reference to a temple of Dionysos Polites, but its date is unknown. The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally on coins (Babelon, Traité ii. 3 no. 1015 ), and externally in SEG 11 1045 ( c. 500 ); Thuc. 5 . 67 . 1 ; IPArk no. 15 . 19 (C4m); and Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 11 . The individual use is found externally on IG ii² 2327 (rC6 ) and IG iv² . 1 96 . 35 (C3f). Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 22 ( απαλλάττονται ( sc . the Arkadian federal troops) εκ τηtildeς ' Ηραίας ) suggests that the toponym could designate the territory as well as the city, since it is a reasonable inference from the context that the federal troops were operating not in the city, but in the territory of Heraia (so Bölte ( 1913 b ) 415 ). Its size was c. 265 km ² . Bölte ( 1913 b ) estimated the citizen population at min. 2 , 000 . According to Strabo 8 . 3 . 2 , Heraia was synoecised (at an unknown date: Bergese ( 1985 )) from nine δηtilde µ οι . These demes were perhaps minor settlements in the territory. Their identity is unknown, but Bölte ( 1913 b ) 412 counted Melainai and Bouphagion among them. A site which he identified with Bouphagion is described by Meyer ( 1939 a ) 103 -6 , but Jost ( 1985 ) 76 -77 rejects the identification of this site with Bouphagion. The impressive fortifications of the site and its acropolis are Heltic (Meyer ( 1939 a ) 106 ; Jost ( 1985 ) 76 states that they are Classical), but large quantities of Archaic and Classical sherds were found at the site (Meyer ( 1939 a ) 102 ), which perhaps had a temple on the acropolis (ibid. 106 ). Meyer ( 1957 b ) 20 identified another site, Loutra Ireas, near Betsi as another Heraian 'Dorf' . A number of fortresses in the territory are known; one at Ochthia on the border with Thelphousa (no. 300 ) is described by Meyer ( 1939 a ) 100 -1 : sherds at the site go back to the Archaic period.Near Paloumba is another fortified site (including a temple) with sherds going back to the Archaic period,for which see Meyer ( 1939 a ) 102 and Pikoulas ( 1999 a ) 304 -5 (suggesting that this may be Melainai). The symmachy treaty ML 17 ( c. 500 ) was traditionally thought of as concluded between Elis (no. 251 ) and Heraia; however, Dubois ( 1985 ) correctly pointed out that the form ' ΕρΓaltαοῖοι (the then accepted reading) would be unique for the Heraian ethnic (cf. Roy ( 1997 ) 293 -94 ); a recent reexamination of the text (by Roy and Schofield ( 1999 )) has established that the name of Elis' partner was in fact ' ΕΓaltαοῖοι , which should probably be thought of as an otherwise unknown minor community in Eleia (see Ewaoioi (no. 253 )). Heraia fought with Sparta (no. 345 ) at Mantinea in 418 (Thuc. 5 . 67 . 1 ), and was thus a member of the Peloponnesian League.The city was loyal to Sparta even after Leuktra (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 11 ), although it eventually joined the Arkadian Confederacy ( IG v . 2 1 . 58 ( 360 s)). Heraian military activity is attested, in addition to Thuc. 5 . 67 . 1 , by Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 11 and SEG 11 1045 ( c. 500 ), a dedication of spoils taken from the Heraians and set up by an unknown Arkadian community. IPArk no. 15 . 19 (a treaty of sympoliteia between Euaimon (no. 269 ) and Orchomenos (no. 286 )) stipulates that the Heraians are to act as arbiters in case of conflicts over property rights. A Delphic theorodokos resided in Heraia in C5l-C4e ( REG 62 ( 1949 ) p. 6 ll. 11 -12 ). Nothing is known about the form of constitution at Heraia, but from the passage at Arist. Pol . 1303 a 15 -16 it can be inferred that at some point there was a constitutional reform there whereby the procedure for the appointment of magistrates was changed from election to sortition. Bölte ( 1913 b ) 415 dates the reform to 370 . At Diod. 15 . 40 . 2 (r 375 ) a Heraia is described as a χωρίον οχυροgraveν ; if this is a reference to this city (which has been disputed; cf. Stylianou ( 1998 ) ad loc .), it may mean that the city was fortified (Bölte ( 1913 b ) 414 ): early travellers saw the remains of well-built walls, but these may have been Heltic (ibid. 408 and 415 ). The city of Heraia seems to have occupied a large area (Jost ( 1985 ) 73 ), but since the site has not been systematically investigated, no description of the urban layout is possible (Philadelpheus ( 1931 -32 ) reviews the remains at Heraia). Heraian coinage began c. 510 ; the earliest coins are hemidrachms and obols: obv . head of Hera; rev . Ε , ΕΡ , ΕΡΑ or ΕΡΑΙ ; see R. T. Williams ( 1970 ) and SNG Cop. Argolis 231 -33 . By C5l-C4 the city struck in silver ( SNG Cop. Argolis 234 -36 ) and possibly even in iron (for which see Köhler ( 1882 a )), and by C4 in bronze ( SNG Cop. Argolis 236 -41 ). Attested denominations are triobol, diobol, trihemiobol, obol and hemiobol.The legends are Ε , ΕΡ , ΕΡΑ , ΕΡΑΙ , Η , ΗΡ , ΗΡΑΕΩΝ (Head, HN ² 448 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 1 nos. 1211 -23 and ii. 3 nos. 1000 -15 ). The most common types depict female deities (Artemis and Athena), but Pan is found too (Imhoof-Blumer and Gardner ( 1964 ) 103 ). The pantheon of Heraia is discussed by Jost ( 1985 ) 70 -77 . Heraians achieved two Olympic victories in C6 ( Olympionikai 132 , 138 ) and six in C5 ( Olympionikai 189 , 200 , 205 , 313 , 317 , 344 )."
275,Kaphy(i)ai (Kaphyieus),Arkadia,37.45,22.15,524,2539,"275 . Kaphy(i)ai (Kaphyieus) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 45 , long. 22 . 15 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: B. The toponym is Καφυιαί , αιasper in IG iv² . 1 122 (C4 ); it is Καφυacuteαι in Michel 489 (C4 ) and Theophr. Hist. pl. 4 . 13 . 2 . The city-ethnic is Καφυιευacuteς in F.Delphes iii . 4 191 (C5f) and CID ii 12 . i . 2 ( 341 / 40 ); Καφυευacuteς is found in IG ii² 66 c ( c. 400 ); cf. Roy ( 1972 a ) 333 -34 . There is no certain attestation of polis in any Archaic or Classical source: in Theopomp. fr. 77 . 3 πόλις probably does not stem from Theopompos. The earliest source that classifies Kaphy(i)ai as a polis is Staatsverträge 476 . 25 , 92 ( c. 265 ). The city-ethnic is found externally in the collective use in F.Delphes iii . 4 191 (C5f), and in the individual use in IG ii² 66 c ( c. 400 ) and CID ii 12 . i . 2 ( 341 / 40 ). The territory occupied c. 220 km ² . A Classical sanctuary in the territory is reported by ArchDelt 37 ( 1982 ) 116 and AR 37 ( 1991 ) 25 ; for another, see Pritchett ( 1969 ) 125 and Jost ( 1985 ) 112 . For a possible fortress, see Jost ( 1985 ) 112 . Kaphy(i)ai was a member of the revived Peloponnesian League of King Areus of Sparta (no. 345 ) for the Chremonidean War ( Staatsverträge 476 . 25 ), but membership of the early Peloponnesian League may be assumed as well (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 87 ). Membership of the Arkadian Confederacy is not explicitly attested, but may be assumed (ibid. 95 ). Kaphy(i)an military activity can be inferred from F.Delphes iii . 4 191 (C5f), a dedication of spoils taken ΤΟΝ [ ΠΟ ] ΛΕΜΙΟΝ and set up at Delphi. A citizen of Kaphyiai was Athenian proxenos in C5l and had the grant renewed after the fall of the Thirty ( IG ii² 66 c with Walbank ( 1978 ) 151 -53 ). The city of Kaphy(i)ai was,like Mantinea (no. 281 ), situated in a plain and not centred on an acropolis (Pritchett ( 1969 ) 123 -24 ). It was located south-east of the modern village of Chotoussa, and the site is covered with Classical sherds and other remains (Pritchett ( 1969 ) 123 -24 ; Howell ( 1970 ) 81 ; Jost ( 1985 ) 111 ). There are also remains of a circuit wall with round towers at Kaphy(i)ai,but they have not been systematically investigated (Pritchett ( 1969 ) 123 -24 ). Among isolated finds from the city is an Archaic bronze statuette, reported by von Gaertringen and Lattermann ( 1911 ) 42 with table 13 . 2 . The Kaphy(i)an pantheon is almost unknown (Jost ( 1985 ) 110 -11 ); Theophr. Hist. pl . 4 . 13 . 2 reports that Agamemnon was held to have planted a platanos in the city."
276,Kleitor (Kleitorios),Arkadia,37.55,22.05,1151,5549,"276 . Kleitor (Kleitorios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 55 , long. 22 . 05 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A. The toponym is found as [ Κλε ( ι )] τορ in IG iv 510 (C5f), as Κλείτωρ , οasper in Pind. Nem . 10 . 47 ; SEG 20716 (C4 ), and as Κλήτωρ in SEG 23 189 ( c. 330 ). The city-ethnic is Κλειτόριος (Paus. 5 . 23 . 7 (rC6s); Maddoli ( 1992 ) 260 ; Syll . ³ 291 ( 332 )) or Κλητόριος (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 36 ; IG v . 2 1 . 52 ( 360 s)), abbreviated to ΚΛΕΤΟ on C5 coins (Head, HN ² 446 ). No Archaic or Classical source explicitly calls Kleitor a polis , but at Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 37 the city is referred to as a polis in the political sense. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C5 coins (Head, HN ² 446 ) and externally in Paus. 5 . 23 . 7 (rC6s) (cf. Maddoli ( 1992 ) 260 ); IG v . 2 1 . 52 ( 360 s); and Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 36 . The individual use is attested externally in IvO 167 (C4f) and CID ii 51 . 7 (C4m). The name of the territory was Κλειτορία (Theophr. Hist. pl . 9 . 15 . 6 ; Polyb. 4 . 11 . 2 ). Pausanias mentions a number of sites inside the territory: Leukasion, Mesoboa, Nasoi, Oryx, Halous (no. 272 ), Thaliades (no. 299 ) ( 8 . 23 . 8 -24 . 3 ), Soron, Paion (no. 288 ), Seirai, Argeathai, Lykountes and Skotane (cf. Jost ( 1985 ) 42 -46 ). Of these, Paion and Thaliades were probably, and Halous possibly, poleis at some time (see the respective entries); but whether they were dependent poleis within Kleitorian territory in the Archaic and Classical periods is unknown, though not impossible. About the other toponyms,nothing is known.On the basis of the map in Jost ( 1985 ), the size of the territory can be estimated at c. 625 km ² , but this includes Lousoi (no. 279 ), Paion, Thaliades and Halous: it is unknown whether all of these ever formed part of Kleitor prior to the Roman era.For two C4s fortresses, see Pikoulas ( 1999 b ) 144 -53 . Kleitor was almost certainly an Azanian community (K. Tausend ( 1993 ) 15 ); however, if the Azanians ever formed a political unit, this had broken up before C5 (Roy ( 1972 b ) 44 , ( 1996 ) 110 ; Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 139 ). Kleitor may just possibly have headed a small hegemonic league in northern Arkadia (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 86 -87 ). The city was a member of the Peloponnesian League (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 36 -37 ) before the foundation of the Arkadian Confederacy of which it was a member ( IG v . 2 1 . 52 ( 360 s)), and probably a leading one since it, like Mantinea (no. 281 ) and Tegea (no. 297 ), provided two of the ten oecists who founded Megalopolis (no. 282 ) (Paus. 8 . 27 . 2 (r 371 )). C6s military activity can be inferred from Paus. 5 . 23 . 2 (Maddoli ( 1992 ) 260 ), referring to spoils dedicated at Olympia and, according to the accompanying epigram, taken by the Kleitorians πολλαtildeν εκ πολίων χερσιgrave βιασσά µ ενοι . At Hell . 5 . 4 . 36 Xenophon has a brief reference to a war in 379 between Kleitor and Orchomenos (no. 286 ) (cf. Roy ( 1972 c )); for this war the Kleitorians had hired mercenaries (ibid.), but it is not clear whether they conducted the war exclusively with mercenaries. Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 37 refers to the άρχων τῶν παραgrave τοῖς Κλητορίοις ξένων , but it is not clear whether he was a citizen or a mercenary as well. Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 36 mentions negotiations between Sparta (no. 345 ) and Kleitor, and SEG 20 716 . 14 -15 refers to an embassy which travelled from Kyrene (no. 1028 ) to Kleitor; a Kleitorian was appointed Delphic proxenos in 332 ( Syll . ³ 291 ), and IG v . 2 368 is a long C3e catalogue of proxenoi of Kleitor. IPArk no. 30 , a sacred law of c. 525 , may belong to Kleitor. C. 330 an Argive theorodokos resided at Kleitor ( SEG 23 189 . ii . 22 ). In C4f the constitution was presumably democratic (Roy ( 1972 c ) 79 ). SEG 20 716 . 18 -19 (C4m) mentions a sentence of exile passed by the Kleitorians. Like Mantinea, Kleitor was situated in a plain and had no acropolis (Jost ( 1985 ) 40 ; Winter ( 1989 ) 198 with fig. 3 ). The Heltic fortification wall is 2 , 500 m long and encloses an area of c. 58 ha (Petritaki ( 1996 ) 83 -84 ). It is built of stone throughout (Winter ( 1989 ) 198 ); it is 'among the most advanced anywhere in the Peloponnese' , and so Winter ( 1989 ) 199 dates it to c. 300 . Inside the walled area are numerous ancient remains, and a theatre is discernible (Petritaki ( 1996 ) 85 ; cf. TGR ii. 237 ); ceramic evidence suggests that the earliest phases of the construction may go back to C4 (Petritaki ( 2001 )). Outside the wall are late Archaic and Classical graves (Petritaki ( 1996 ) 84 ). According to Head, HN ² 446 , minting at Kleitor began c. C5m; Babelon, Traité ii. 1 . 877 -88 dates its start somewhat earlier. The city struck in both silver ( SNG Cop. Argolis 217 -25 ) and bronze (from C4 ; SNG Cop. Argolis 226 -30 ). Known denominations are triobol, obol, hemiobol and possibly tetartemorion ( SNG Cop. Argolis 218 ). Recurrent types show Athena, horses and Helios (cf. Lacroix ( 1968 )). Legends are ΚΛ , ΚΛΗ , ΚΛΕΤΟ . The Kleitorian pantheon is imperfectly known; Athena Koria was probably the most important divinity (Jost ( 1985 ) 41 -42 ). Prestigious games were celebrated at Kleitor (Pind. Nem . 10 . 47 ; Lazzarini ( 1976 ) no. 865 (C5f)). Delphic promanteia is granted to a Kleitorian by Syll . ³ 291 ( 332 ). Two Olympic victors from the city are on record, in 384 ( Olympionikai 395 ) and in 376 ( Olympionikai 406 ). In C6s (Paus. 5 . 23 . 7 ; for which see Maddoli ( 1992 ) 260 ), the city set up a dedication of spoils at Olympia."
277,Koila,Arkadia,,,82,375,"277 . Koila Unlocated (Meyer ( 1957 a) 86 ). Size of territory: ? Type: C. The toponym is Κοίλα in REG 62 ( 1949 ) p. 6 ll. 4 -5 (C5l-C4e); an ethnic is not attested. Koila deserves inclusion in this Inventory solely because it may have had a Delphic theorodokos in C5l-C4e ( REG 62 ( 1949 ) p. 6 ll. 4 -5 ), and thus was possibly a polis (Perlman ( 1995 ) 116 , 121 , 135 )."
278,Kynaitha (Kynaitheus),Arkadia,38.0,22.05,280,1283,"278 . Kynaitha (Kynaitheus) Map. 58 . Lat. 38 . 00 , long. 22 . 05 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: C. The toponym is Κυacuteναιθα , -ης , ηasper (Polyb. 4 . 17 . 3 , 9 . 17 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is Κυναιθευacuteς (Aristox. fr. 135 , Wehrli; Polyb. 4 . 16 . 11 ); Paus. 5 . 22 . 1 has Κυναιθαευacuteς , and Steph. Byz. 393 . 4 cites Κυναιθαιευacuteς in addition to the two forms listed here. No Archaic or Classical source mentions Kynaitha, but Polybios at 4 . 16 . 11 calls it a polis in the political sense, and at 9 . 17 . 1 in the urban sense; at 4 . 17 . 10 he uses πατρίς , and at 17 . 11 πολιτεία . However, since there is a C4 occurrence of the city-ethnic in the external individual use (Aristox. fr. 135 , Wehrli), the city must have existed in the Classical period and was possibly a polis (Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 131 -32 ), as it certainly was in C3 (see, e.g., the description of a stasis given by Polyb. 4 . 17 -18 and 9 . 17 ). The name of the territory is unknown; at 4 . 17 . 5 , Polybios terms it γηtilde . It occupied c. 125 km ² . There are no important remains in the territory (Jost ( 1985 ) 53 ), and the major part of the city itself is probably hidden beneath modern Kalavryta (Meyer ( 1939 a ) 107 and Howell ( 1970 ) 96 ; but see Petropoulos ( 1985 ) 65 -66 )."
279,Lousoi (Lousiatas),Arkadia,38.0,22.05,924,4209,"279 . Lousoi (Lousiatas) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 00 , long. 22 . 05 . Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is Λουσοί in IG v . 2 399 (C5e); Bacchyl. Ep . 11 . 96 has Λουtildeσος , but this refers to a spring at the sanctuary of Artemis Hemera, and need not be the form behind the locative Λουσοῖ found in IG v . 2 394 . 132 ( c. 200 ); see Bölte ( 1927 ) 1891 . Arist. Mir. ausc . 842 b 2 and IG v . 1 1387 . 2 (C3 ) have Λουσοί , οί . Theophr. Hist. pl. 9 . 15 . 8 , 16 . 8 has Σουtildeσα , commonly taken to be a corruption of Λουtildeσα , ταgrave , see Bölte ( 1927 ) 1891 . In C5 , the ethnic is found both as Λουσεάτας ( IG v . 2 387 . 8 (C5s)) and as Λουσιάτας ( IG v . 2 387 . 2 (C5s)); later only Λουσιάτας is found, e.g. Xen. An . 7 . 6 . 40 ; Xen. An . 4 . 2 . 21 , 7 . 11 -12 has Λουσιευacuteς (cf. Philostr. De gymnastica 12 (r 708 )); Paus. 8 . 18 . 8 uses Λουσευacuteς retrospectively (rC6 ). Lousoi may be called a polis in a treaty dating to 500 -475 ( Nomima i no. 57 , but cf. Dubois ( 1986 ) 220 ); a series of decrees dating to C4l onwards ( IG v . 2 388 -96 ) frequently refers to the city as a polis in the political sense.The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally in IG v . 2 387 (C5s) and externally in IG v . 2 358 (C3f?) and Polyb. 4 . 18 . 11 . The external individual use is found in Xen. An . 7 . 6 . 40 (cf. Philostr. De gymnastica 12 (r 708 ) and Paus. 8 . 18 . 8 (r 546 )). The name and size of the territory are unknown; IPArk no. 22 (C3 ) may be a delimitation of the border between Lousoi and Achaian Boura (no. 233 ). Stangl ( 1999 b ) estimates that the territory could support max. 1 , 000 individuals. For a Classical watch-tower in the territory, see K. Tausend ( 1999 b ) 306 -7 . Lousoi was probably an Azanian community (K.Tausend ( 1993 ) 15 ); however, if the Azanians ever formed a political unit, this had broken up before C5 (Roy ( 1972 b ) 44 , ( 1996 ) 110 ; Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 138 ). The city may have been party to a treaty as early as 500 -475 ( Nomima i no. 57 , but cf. Dubois ( 1986 ) 220 ).A C3f(?) treaty with Stymphalos (no. 296 ) is preserved as IG v . 2 358 ( = Staatsverträge 560 ). The earliest public enactment of Lousoi is a C5s list of proxenoi ( IG v . 2 387 ); IPArk no. 20 , a sacred law of c. 525 , may belong to Lousoi. The decrees IG v . 2 388 -96 (C4l onwards) attest to an eponymous damiorgos , a board of damiorgoi and an oikonomos . From the enactment formulas (e.g. έδοξε ταtildeι πόλι τῶλ Λουσιαταtildeν ( IG v . 2 389 ), έδοξε τῶι δά µ ω ( ι ) τῶλ Λουσ [ ι ] αταtildeν ( IG v . 2 390 )), the existence of an assembly may be inferred. An enktesis grant is found in IG v . 2 394 (C3l). According to Paus. 8 . 18 . 8 , Agesilas of Lousoi was victorious in the Pythian Games in 546 ; Eurybatos of Lousoi is recorded as Olympic victor as early as 708 ( Olympionikai 22 ); cf. S. T ausend ( 1999 ). The acropolis of Lousoi is crowned by a C4fortification wall,possibly of mudbrick on a polygonal stone foundation, and encloses an area of 0 . 3 ha (Petropoulos ( 1985 ) 67 -73 ). South of the acropolis is the most important feature of the community of Lousoi: the sanctuary of Artemis Hemera (Jost ( 1985 ) 47 ), the pre-eminent divinity of the city. The temple is Heltic, but an older structure probably existed (Jost ( 1985 ) 49 ; Voyatzis ( 1990 ) 36 ). For a plan of the sanctuary, see Jost ( 1985 ) pl. 5 . 1 . K. Tausend ( 1993 ) suggests that the sanctuary at Lousoi was originally the cultic centre of the Azanian tribe, and owed its continual importance to this fact. The city lay c. 1 km west of the sanctuary, at Phournoi, where there are numerous ancient remains (Jost ( 1985 ) 48 ). Private houses of C4 -C3 have been found; see AR ( 1984 -85 ) 23 , ( 1985 -86 ) 28 , ( 1988 -89 ) 33 -34 , and Mitsopoulos-Leon ( 1985 ) 96 . Apart from Artemis, no other divinities are securely attested at Lousoi (Jost ( 1985 ) 50 ) unless IPArk no. 20 , mentioning Demeter, belongs to Lousoi. The city certainly celebrated games in honour of Artemis by C3 ( IG v . 1 1387 ) but may already have done so in C4 when the series of decrees granting theorodokia commences ( IG v . 2 388 -96 ); cf. S. Tausend ( 1999 ) 372 -73 ."
280,Lykosoura (Lykourasios),Arkadia,37.25,22.0,686,3532,"280 . Lykosoura (Lykourasios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 25 , long. 22 . 00 . Size of territory: ? Type: C. The toponym is Λυκόσουρα , ηasper ( SEG 41 332 . 45 ( c. 230 -190 )); the MSS of Pausanias have different variants of this form (Meyer ( 1927 ) 2417 -18 ). The city-ethnic is Λυκουράσιος in SEG 41 332 . 1 ( c. 230 -190 ); Pausanias (e.g. 8 . 27 . 6 (r 371 / 70 )) uses Λυκοσουρευacuteς (Meyer ( 1927 ) 2417 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally in SEG 41 332 . 22 -23 ( c. 230 -190 ) and externally in Paus. 8 . 27 . 5 (r 371 ) (probably taken over from a historiographic source, see Nielsen ( 1996 b ) 296 ). No Archaic or Classical source mentions Lykosoura. At 8 . 27 . 4 (r 371 ), Pausanias states that Lykosoura was among the communities that the Arkadian Confederacy voted to relocate to Megalopolis (no. 282 ); however, he goes on to explain that this decision was not implemented ( 8 . 27 . 6 ), because the city resisted the relocation. Since the very first source that mentions Lykosoura ( SEG 41 332 ( c. 230 -190 )) describes it as a polis (in the political sense, e.g. l. 3 ) and refers to the politai (ll. 7 -8 ), it is possible that at the foundation of Megalopolis the city was left as a dependent polis inside Megalopolitan territory. Three other cities that resisted the synoecism (Lykaia, Trikolonoi and Trapezous (no. 303 )) were either forced to relocate (Lykaia and Trikolonoi) or annihilated (Trapezous). It is thus rather remarkable that Lykosoura was spared, and we should look for an explanation. According to Paus. 8 . 27 . 6 , the inhabitants of the city took shelter in the sanctuary of Despoina and were spared ' ∆ή µ ητρός τε εasperacuteνεκα καιgrave ∆εσποίνης ' . The best explanation, then, seems to be that the city was allowed to exist in order to look after the important sanctuary at which it was situated (see also the judicious remarks by Meyer ( 1927 ) 2431 on the importance of the sanctuary in comparison with the city). And in fact, the decree SEG 41 332 ( c. 223 -190 ) that shows Lykosoura acting as a polis concerns business related to the sanctuary. This points to the conclusion that after the synoecism Lykosoura was a dependent polis in charge of an important sanctuary inside the polis of Megalopolis (see Meyer ( 1927 ) 2431 -32 , suggesting that citizens of Lykosoura were also citizens of Megalopolis; cf. Jost ( 1999 ) 194 ). Before the synoecism of Megalopolis, Lykosoura belonged to the Parrhasian tribe (Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 ; Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 132 -34 ). In C5s the Parrhasians, and thus probably Lykosoura, were members of a local hegemonic league led by Mantinea (no. 281 ), for which see Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 79 -86 . Membership of the Peloponnesian League may be assumed; it was probably mediated by the Parrhasian tribe (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 97 , 89 , 100 -1 ). Membership of the Arkadian Confederacy through the Parrhasian tribe can be inferred from Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 (cf. Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 87 , 89 , 100 -1 ). The date at which the monumental buildings in the sanctuary at Lykosoura were erected is not certain, but may be C4 (Jost ( 1985 ) 178 ). Above the sanctuary is the walled acropolis of the city; Meyer ( 1927 ) 2426 dates the wall to C5 -C4 (so PECS ). Ancient temple remains were reused in a chapel (Meyer ( 1927 ) 2426 ). The city proper (termed άστυ by Paus. 8 . 27 . 5 ) was on the northern slope of the acropolis, west of the sanctuary; Meyer ( 1927 ) 2426 reports that 'der ganze Nord- und Ostabhang ist mit antiken Trümmern übersät' ."
281,Mantinea (Mantineus),Arkadia,37.35,22.25,3331,16081,"281 . Mantinea (Mantineus) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 22 . 25 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The epichoric and Doric form of the toponym is Μαντινέα , ηasper ( SEG 37 340 . 6 (C4f); IG v . 1 1124 (C5l)); the regular Ionic form is Μαντινέη (Hom. Il . 2 . 607 ; Hdt. 4 . 161 . 2 ), but Hecat. fr. 123 ( = Steph. Byz. 13 . 8 ) apparently used the synaloiphic form Μαντίνη . The Attic form is Μαντίνεια (Eupolis fr. 99 . 30 , K&amp;A; Thuc. 5 . 55 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is invariably Μαντινευacuteς (Hdt. 4 . 162 . 2 ; CID ii 1 . ii . 24 ( 360 )). For ethnic and toponym, see further Bölte ( 1930 ) 1290 -92 . Mantinea is called polis in the urban sense at Thuc. 5 . 33 . 2 , Ephor. fr. 79 , Ps.-Skylax 44 (who lists it as the second toponym after the heading πόλεις αιasper µ εγάλαι αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense), and at Isoc. Paneg . 126 ; in the territorial sense at Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 6 ; and in the political sense at Hdt. 7 . 202 and 204 , Thuc. 5 . 47 . 3 , and IG i³ 83 . 15 -17 ( 420 ). Hermippos apud Ath. 4 . 41 (rC6 ) uses πολῖται (Hdt. 4 . 161 . 2 (rC6m) has αστοί ); Isoc. Paneg . 125 uses πολιτεία (opposed to µ οναρχίαι ); Ael. VH 2 . 23 (rC5s) uses πολιτευacuteεσθαι ; and Polyb. 6 . 43 . 1 πολίτευ µ α (achronic reference). At 5 . 69 . 1 Thucydides uses πατρίς (cf. CEG ii 887 (C4 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally in SEG 37 340 (C4f), and externally at Hdt. 4 . 161 . 2 (rC6m), Bacchyl. fr. 21 , Thuc. 3 . 107 . 4 , IvO 16 . 17 (C5m) and IG i³ 83 . 4 ( 420 ); the individual use is attested externally only, e.g. Hdt. 4 . 162 . 2 (rC6m), SEG 26 330 (C4 ), CID ii 1 . ii . 24 ( 360 ) and Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 23 . The territory occupied c. 295 km ² (cf. Hodkinson and Hodkinson ( 1981 ) 275 n. 128 ), and its name was ηasper Μαντινική (Thuc. 5 . 64 . 5 ; Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 15 ). However,the passage at Thuc. 5 . 64 . 4 ( βοηθεῖν δεgrave καιgrave Αθηναίους ες . . . Μαντίνειαν ) suggests that the toponym could also designate the territory. The territory is termed γηtilde by Hdt. 9 . 77 . 3 , Thuc. 5 . 64 . 5 and Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 4 , and χώρα at Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 15 ; for the territory, see Hodkinson and Hodkinson ( 1981 ) 242 -46 . The neighbours were, to the north, Orchomenos (no. 286 ); to the east, Argos (no. 347 ); to the south, Tegea (no. 297 ); and to the west, Mainalia. Extra-urban sanctuaries are known, e.g. one of Herakles mentioned at Thuc. 5 . 64 . 5 (for which see Pritchett ( 1969 ) 46 -49 ); see also Jost ( 1985 ) 132 -41 . The important sanctuary of Poseidon Hippios, the tutelary god of the city (Brackertz ( 1976 ) 68 -71 ), was situated 1 . 3 km south of the city; it has been located, but no substantial finds have been published (Jost ( 1985 ) 136 ); however, the web site of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture (www.culture.gr s.v. 'The Sanctuary of Hippios Poseidon' as assessed 21 January 2003 ) reports: 'The excavations of Th. Spyropoulos in 1985 -95 revealed remains of the Archaic temple and important objects of the same period (clay akroterion of Lakonic type bearing Gorgoneion, pottery of Archaic and Classical date, idols, etc.). The excavations also uncovered later buildings and tombs preserving ancient liberative inscriptions dedicated to Hippios Poseidon.' For a group of four C4fortified watch-towers in the territory, see Pikoulas ( 1995 ) cat. nos. 38 -41 ; see also Jost ( 2001 -2 ) esp. fig. 1 , noting a new tower at Simiades. The town of Mantinea (the date of whose foundation is uncertain; see Hodkinson and Hodkinson ( 1981 ) 256 -61 ) was not the only settlement in Mantinean territory. A number of sources state that at the dioikismos in 385 ( infra ) the Mantineans were dispersed to the old villages, komai , which was their old pre-synoecistic way of life. It seems likely that these villages were the ones from which the city was originally synoecised ( infra ); but it is unknown whether they were inhabited between the original synoecism and the dioikismos (Hodkinson and Hodkinson ( 1981 ) 261 -63 ), although it seems probable (Bölte ( 1930 ) 1318 ; Hodkinson and Hodkinson ( 1981 ) 264 ; Jost ( 1986 a ) 155 ). The identity of these komai is not clear from Classical sources, but Pausanias mentions a number of sites that are possibly to be identified with at least some of them (Jost ( 1986 a ) 155 -56 ). Hodkinson and Hodkinson ( 1981 ) 262 have identified two of the villages with surviving remains: (a) Nestane (no. 284 ), c. 7 . 5 km west of Mantinea town. The site occupies the hill of Nestani, measures 160 × 40 m, and was fortified c. 370 (Hodkinson and Hodkinson ( 1981 ) 247 ). There are some foundations on the summit, and a few Classical and Heltic sherds were found there (Howell ( 1970 ) 87 ). A lower ridge runs east-west for 350 m and is probably the site of the village (Hodkinson and Hodkinson ( 1981 ) 246 -48 ); (b) Maira, c. 5 . 7 km north of Mantinea town (ibid. 248 -50 ). Atmodern Gourtsouli,probably ancient Ptolis,just north of the town, there is evidence of cult and habitation down to C6l, thereafter of cult only (ibid. 252 -56 ); see, however, AR ( 1990 -91 ) 26 reporting early Heltic habitation on the eastern slope. It seems reasonably certain that at least in some periods the Mantinike included a number of settlements which were themselves organised as poleis . Thus, Nestane had its own ethnic in C4 , which indicates that the city was organised as a polis (and thus as a dependent polis within Mantinean territory) since no Arkadian sub-ethnics are known (Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 117 -32 ); it is likely that during the dioikismos Nestane and (some of) the other individual komai rose to polis status (Polyb. 4 . 27 . 6 (r 385 )), and that this was recognised at the new synoecism in 370 (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 3 ). However,even prior to the dioikismos the Mantinike included other poleis besides Mantinea. Thus, it is clear from the treaty SEG 37 340 (C4f) that by this treaty the Mantinike was enlarged to cover the territory of Helisson (no. 273 ), and that Helisson persisted as a (dependent) polis within Mantinean territory; the text furthermore shows that Helisson was not the only polis in this position; others may have been some of the original komai or other Mainalian communities such as Dipaia (no. 268 ), etc.; cf. Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 66 -70 . AtThermopylai Mantinea contributed 500 hoplites (Hdt. 7 . 202 ), and in 420 , 1 , 000 soldiers helped to protect the Olympic Games against an anticipated Spartan attack. According to Lys. 34 . 7 , the Mantineans did not number 3 , 000 ; it is not possible to give any exact estimate of the size of population on this basis (cf. Forsén ( 2000 ) 36 -39 ); Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 7 implies that in 385 residence in the town was the norm in Mantinea. Mantinea was a member of the Hellenic League against Persia (Hdt. 7 . 202 ) and of the Peloponnesian League (Thuc. 5 . 29 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 3 ; cf. Tuplin ( 1977 )), but relations with Sparta (no. 345 ) were very varied and seldom easy (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 90 -91 ). In 421 Mantinea defected from the League and concluded an alliance with Argos (Thuc. 5 . 29 . 1 ), which was followed the next year by the conclusion of a quadruple alliance of Argos (no. 347 ), Athens (no. 361 ), Elis (no. 251 ) and Mantinea (Thuc. 5 . 47 = IG i³ 80 ). However, after the defeat at Mantinea in 418 (exactly when is unknown), Mantinea came to terms with Sparta again (Thuc. 5 . 81 . 1 ); and it remained an ally of Sparta (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 1 ) down to the foundation of the Arkadian Confederacy after Leuktra. Inside Arkadia,Mantinea was a major power,and in C5s it led a league that included all the Parrhasians and some of the Mainalians (see Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 79 -84 for details), who were reduced to dependencies. In C4f Helisson was reduced to dependent status through a treaty of what amounts to sympoliteia ( SEG 37 340 ). The city was also a leading member of the Arkadian Confederacy ( IG v . 2 1 . 34 ( 360 s)); the move towards the foundation of the Confederacy probably began in Mantinea (Larsen ( 1968 ) 183 ; Du˘ sani´ c ( 1970 ) 285 ), and it was the home town of the important federal leader Lykomedes (for whom see Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 23 -24 , 1 . 39 , 4 . 2 -3 ), who was one of the two oecists that the city supplied for the foundation of Megalopolis (no. 282 ) (Paus. 8 . 27 . 2 ). Mantinea was likewise a chief actor in the crisis that led to the dismemberment of the Confederacy in 363 (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 33 ff; Larsen ( 1968 ) 189 ; Roy ( 1971 a ) 588 ). After the Confederacy split up, Mantinea seems, like Megalopolis, to have been the leading city of a continued but smaller Confederacy ( Staatsverträge 290 ; Diod. 15 . 94 . 1 -3 (r 361 ), 16 . 39 . 1 -3 (r 352 ); Staatsverträge 337 , 342 ; cf. Nielsen ( 1996 b ) 356 -59 ). According to Strabo 8 . 3 . 2 , Mantinea was originally synoecised from five demoi (termed komai at Diod. 15 . 5 . 4 ; cf. Ephor.fr. 79 ). At Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 7 , it is stated that settlement in (four) komai was the old way of the Mantineans,given up by 385 ; but the dioikismos that year meant a return to this settlement pattern,and the implication is that the original synoecism was the reverse process. The synoecism cannot be dated (Hodkinson and Hodkinson ( 1981 ) 257 -61 ). In 385 , the Spartans undid the synoecism by dioikismos , described in our sources by the terms διοικίζειν (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 7 ; Isoc. De Pace 100 ; Ephor. fr. 79 . 2 ; Polyb. 4 . 27 . 6 ), µ ετοικεῖν (Diod. 15 . 12 . 2 ) and ανάστατον ποιεῖν (Isoc. Paneg . 126 ). However, in 370 the city was synoecised again (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 3 -5 ). Mantinean military activity is attested by, e.g., Hdt. 7 . 202 and Thuc. 5 . 69 . 1 ; commanders are mentioned at Hdt. 7 . 203 and Thuc. 5 . 69 . 1 . Ephor.fr. 54 implies that public instruction in fighting under arms was given at Mantinea from an early date; Bölte ( 1930 ) 1317 assumes that this institution was inspired by Sparta. Bacchyl. Ep . fr. 1 . 2 -3 with schol. Pind. Ol . 10 . 83 a suggest that Mantinean hoplites carried the trident of Poseidon as a blazon (Anderson ( 1970 ) 18 ). The military leaders who were late for Plataiai were exiled (Hdt. 9 . 77 . 2 ); in IG v . 2 261 . 18 = IPArk no. 7 (C5m) there is a reference to φευacuteγοντες , and in connection with the dioikismos 60 προστάται τουtilde δή µ ου went into exile (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 6 ). Reception of an embassy is implied by Hdt. 4 . 161 . 2 (rC6m), and Thuc. 5 . 44 . 2 mentions the sending of an embassy. According to Thuc. 5 . 29 . 1 and Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 7 , Mantinea was a democracy, and according to Arist. Pol . 1318 b 27 it had been a democracy of the old, moderate type in which officials were appointed by electors chosen by election from all citizens and serving in rotation (Larsen ( 1950 )). Political decision making, on the other hand, was left to the demos in assembly (cf. Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 4 -5 ). This old type of democracy corresponds to a C4 politeia (Arist. Pol . 1297 b 24 -5 ) in the sense of 'citizen constitution' , and Mantinea is in fact described as a πολιτεία in this sense by Isoc. Paneg . 4 . 125 -26 (r 385 ). Robinson ( 1997 ) 113 -14 believes that Mantinea was a democracy already by C6 , and Waisglas ( 1956 ) argues for the C6mexistence at Mantinea of an elective office of βασιλευacuteς . During the dioikismos , the constitution was aristocratic (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 7 ). In connection with the dioikismos there is evidence of a sharp divide within the citizenry between on the one side οιasper αργολίζοντες and οιasper τουtilde δή µ ου προστάται and on the other οιasper βέλτιστοι (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 6 ). The earliest surviving public enactments are a fragmentary law ( IG v . 2 261 = IPArk no. 7 (C5m)) and the treaties recorded at Thuc. 5 . 47 and SEG 37 340 (C4f). IG v . 2 262 = IPArk no. 8 (C5m) records a verdict and refers to δικασσταί at l. 19 . Ael. VH 2 . 23 (rC5s) mentions a νο µ οθέτης , and in SEG 37 340 . 6 (C4f) there is a general reference to νό µ οι τῶν Μαντινέων as well as a reference to procedural laws (ll. 11 -12 ). A council is attested by Thuc. 5 . 47 . 9 (cf. IG v . 2 289 (C4 ), for Ζευgraveς Ευβωλής ); it possibly had 300 members ( SEG 37 340 . 24 (C4f)). The eponymous official was a δα µ ιοργός ( SEG 37 340 . 20 (C4f)) who probably headed a board (Thuc. 5 . 47 . 9 ). Boards of τα µ ίαι ( IG v . 2 261 . 7 (C5m)), θεωροί (Thuc. 5 . 47 . 9 ), πολέ µ αρχοι (Thuc. 5 . 47 . 9 ), σταλογράφοι ( SEG 37 340 . 18 (C4f)) and θεσ µ οτόαροι ( SEG 37 340 . 20 ) are attested as well. For the assembly, see Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 4 -5 . A system of five phylai is attested, but its function is unknown ( IG v . 2 271 (C4m); Jones, POAG 132 -35 ). The city of Mantinea was situated on level ground and had no acropolis. The town had two periods of existence: down to the dioikismos in 385 , and from the new synoecism in 370 . The first town was fortified (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 1 ), but the wall was pulled down at the dioikismos when the site was abandoned (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 7 ). In 370 it was decided to refortify (and obviously reoccupy) the town (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 3 ). The preserved wall,though probably following the course of the pre-385 wall (Hodkinson and Hodkinson ( 1981 ) 257 -58 ), is the one built in 370 (though it has been thought to incorporate parts of the earlier wall (Scranton ( 1941 ) 57 ff)). It encloses an area of 124 ha (Hodkinson and Hodkinson ( 1981 ) 256 ) and runs for 3 , 942 m with ten gates and 126 towers; it was constructed in mudbrick on a stone foundation (Winter ( 1989 ) 191 ). Not much is known about the degree of urbanisation reached by the pre-385 city; archaeology does not reveal much, and the best information comes, in fact, from the written sources. From Thuc. 5 . 47 . 11 it appears that it had an agora with a sanctuary of Zeus; from SEG 37 340 it appears that there was a boleion (for which see Winter ( 1987 ) 240 -41 ), and Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 1 -7 refers to houses. But even the post-370 city is imperfectly known, since the excavations have been directed primarily towards the area of the agora, which was laid out on the site of the old agora (Winter ( 1987 ) 240 ). Here several stoas have been found, one of which may be a relic of the first town (ibid. 239 -40 ). West of the agora is a C4 theatre (ibid. 240 ; cf. TGR ii. 313 ) with an artificial embankment (Dilke ( 1950 ) 45 -46 ). Near the theatre are several Classical temples (Jost ( 1985 ) 130 -31 ). The 'vast private sector' of the city is completely unknown (Hodkinson and Hodkinson ( 1981 ) 259 ), but at Hell . 7 . 5 . 15 Xenophon refers to houses in the second city too. The rich pantheon of Mantinea is discussed by Jost ( 1985 ) 124 -42 . The patron divinity was Poseidon Hippios,in whose honour festivals were celebrated (Jost ( 1985 ) 133 , 290 ). According to Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 1 , the Spartans in 386 / 5 accused the Mantineans of manipulating εκεχειρία to avoid campaigning. C5 communal consultation of the Delphic oracle is suggested by Paus. 8 . 36 . 8 (Hejnic ( 1961 ) 29 ). Several C5 Olympic victors are on record ( Olympionikai 163 , 193 , 202 , 254 , 256 , 265 ); spoils were dedicated at Delphi c. 423 (Thuc. 4 . 134 . 2 ), and a C5 dedication in Olympia is mentioned at Paus. 5 . 26 . 6 (a wingless Nike by Kalamis, for whom see Pollitt ( 1990 ) 46 ). Mantinea struck silver coins from c. 500 to 385 , and silver and bronze from 370 onwards. Denominations: tritetartemorion, hemiobol, obol, trihemiobol, triobol and drachm. ( 1 ) Silver, 500 -385 . Types: obv . bear or acorn; rev . acorn(s); legend (sometimes on obv .): Μ or ΜΑ or ΜΑΝ or ΜΑΝΤ . ( 2 ) Silver, 370 onwards. Types: obv .

282,Megale  polis (Megalopolites),Arkadia,37.25,22.05,2432,12179,"282 . Megale polis (Megalopolites) Map. 58 . Lat. 37 . 25 , long. 22 . 05 . Size of territory: 4 -5 . Type: A. The toponym is Μεγάλα πόλις , ηasper ( CID ii 5 . i . 24 ( 358 )), or Μεγάλη πόλις in Attic (Dem. 16 . 4 ); the form Μεγαλόπολις is late but occurs, e.g., at Strabo 8 . 4 . 5 . The city-ethnic is Μεγαλοπολίτας ( CID ii 4 . iii . 50 ( 360 )) or in Attic Μεγαλοπολίτης ( IG ii² 161 . 2 (C4m)). Megalopolis is called a polis in the urban sense at Dem. 16 . 25 and Syll . ³ 559 . 29 (r 371 -368 ), and it is listed (as Μεγαλοπολῖται ) as a polis in the political sense in the accounts of the Delphic naopoioi at CID ii 4 . iii . 1 , 50 ( 360 ) under the heading τάδε πόλεις καιgrave ιδιῶται επάρξαντο ; Diod. 18 . 70 . 1 (r 318 ) refers to the πολῖται . The territorial sense of polis (with the political sense as a possible connotation) occurs in Xen. Hell . 7 . 5 . 5 (for which see Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 72 -73 ). The collective use of the ethnic is attested externally in, e.g., CID ii 4 . iii . 50 ( 360 ) and Isoc. 5 . 97 ; the individual use is attested externally in CID ii 4 . iii . 55 -56 ( 360 ). Megalopolis was a creation of the Arkadian Confederacy and was synoecised by a board of ten oikistai , two each from Mantinea (no. 281 ), Tegea (no. 297 ), Kleitor (no. 276 ), the Mainalians and the Parrhasians (Paus. 8 . 27 . 2 ). The synoecism is known principally from Diod. 15 . 72 . 4 , who gives a compressed account of an event and dates the synoecism to 368 ; and from Paus. 8 . 27 . 1 -8 , who gives a detailed account of the original plan for the foundation as well as an account of the implementation of this plan, and dates the synoecism to shortly after Leuktra. The two accounts are, apparently, irreconcilable, and it has been customary to follow one and reject the other; however, the differences concern chiefly the date and the extent of the synoecism, and the difficulties may be at least partly removed by the realisation that Pausanias' account is primarily prescriptive , whereas that of Diodoros is descriptive : thus, the decision to synoecise may have been taken shortly after Leuktra (Paus.) but the implementation may have been postponed to 368 (Diod.). The real problem, however, is the extent of the synoecism. According to Diod. 15 . 72 . 4 , the city was created by a synoecism whereby twenty komai belonging to the Parrhasians and Mainalians were relocated to a new site (accepted by, e.g., Moggi ( 1974 ) and Demand ( 1990 ) 113 ); according to Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 -4 , the synoecism was planned as a much larger enterprise, which was to absorb thirty-nine different poleis , among them some former Lakedaimonian perioikic communities. However, Pausanias himself goes on to explain that the decision was not implemented exactly as planned ( 8 . 27 . 5 -8 ). So, although by the Roman period Megalopolis seems to have controlled all the sites listed by Pausanias (Roy et al . ( 1988 ) 180 ), it is not safe to assume that the synoecism originally had the extent implied by his list. What happened in 368 was thus a synoecism of smaller dimensions than originally envisaged, and the synoecism may primarily have involved Parrhasian and Mainalian communities (Diod.), though Eutresian communities are likely to have been involved as well (cf. Paus. 8 . 27 . 5 , stating that Eutresian Trikolonoi unsuccessfully resisted incorporation). As in many other cases, the synoecism was probably planned, and certainly carried out, as a relocation of only a part of the population of the settlements concerned (Roy ( 1968 ) 159 ). Among the communities situated in Megalopolitan territory, at least Lykosoura (no. 280 ) seems to have survived as a dependent polis , and there may have been some others (Roy ( 2000 a ) 139 ). The ancient sources (Paus. 8 . 27 ; Diod. 15 . 72 . 4 ) agree that Megalopolis was intended to serve as protection against Sparta (no. 345 ). For a modern but highly speculative discussion of the ideology behind the foundation,see Braunert and Petersen ( 1972 ). In 361 the city suffered a serious crisis as some of the relocated populations left for their old settlements and called upon Mantinea for support; the rebellion was, however, overcome with Theban assistance (Diod. 15 . 94 . 1 ); nor did the Spartans succeed in a dioikismos of the city in 352 (Dem. 16 . 30 ; Diod. 16 . 39 ). If the territory comprised all the communities listed at Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 -4 , it will have occupied 1 , 500 km ² (Roy et al . ( 1988 ) 179 ). If, however, the reconstruction of Moggi ( 1974 ), based on Diodoros, is preferred, the territory will have measured c. 400 km ² , somewhat larger than that of Tegea but smaller than that of Kleitor.A survey has been carried out in the territory; from the preliminary reports it appears that even after the synoecism there was considerable habitation in the rural areas, both in dispersed farmsteads and in nucleated settlements (Roy et al . ( 1992 )). Almost all other information about the territory comes from the late account of Pausanias, which is discussed in detail by Jost ( 1973 ). There is no good evidence relating to the size of the population; for what it is worth, Diod. 18 . 70 . 1 states that in 318 the city managed to put 15 , 000 men under arms, but this figure includes metics and slaves (Bury ( 1898 ) 16 ); Gardner et al . ( 1893 ) 3 supposes a total population of 65 , 000 . Megalopolis was a federal foundation,and the city was,of course, a member of the Arkadian Confederacy ( IG v . 2 1 . 23 ( 360 s)).It is often believed that the city was intended to serve as the capital of the Confederacy (Bury ( 1898 ); Braunert and Petersen ( 1972 ) 81 ff). Certainly, the fact that the city provided ten damiorgoi for the Confederacy, whereas Tegea (no. 297 ) and Mantinea provided only five each ( IG v . 2 1 . 1 , 23 , 34 ( 360 s)), suggests that the city did somehow enjoy a favoured position within the Confederacy, but greater precision on this point is impossible (Roy ( 2000 b ); Tsiolis ( 1995 ) 51 , 54 ). When the Confederacy split in 363 , Megalopolis sided with Tegea and Boiotia against Mantinea, Athens (no. 361 ) and Sparta. According to Polyb. 4 . 33 . 9 , after the battle of Mantinea in 362 , Megalopolis was the centre of an Arkadian alliance: Μεγαλοπολῖται καιgrave πάντες οιasper κοινωνουtildeντες Αρκάδων τηtildeς αυτῶν συ µµ αχίας κτλ . This presumably means that the city posed as the leader of one faction of the Confederacy; at least, we know that the federal assembly, Myrioi , held a session in Megalopolis in 348 / 7 (Dem. 19 . 10 ; Aeschin. 2 . 157 ); since there is no reason to believe that the Confederacy had reunited by this date (cf. Staatsverträge 337 ( 342 )), this probably means that Megalopolis claimed to represent the Arkadian Confederacy; but Mantinea probably did so as well; see Nielsen ( 1996 b ) 356 -59 for further discussion. From Dem. 16 . 28 it appears that in the 350 s Megalopolis was allied to Thebes (no. 221 ); from Diod. 16 . 39 it is clear that the city had alliances with Argos (no. 347 ), Sikyon (no. 228 ), Messene (no. 318 ) and Orneai (no. 354 ) as well. Staatsverträge 337 attests to an alliance with Athens in 342 . Xen. Hell . 7 . 5 . 5 refers to Megalopolitan troops. Diod. 18 . 56 . 5 (r 318 ) refers to exiles from the city. Dem. 16 . 1 refers to the sending of an embassy, and Dem. 19 . 10 , Aeschin. 2 . 157 and SEG 20 716 . 20 (C4 ) to reception of embassies. Two citizens were appointed Athenian proxenoi in C4m ( IG ii² 161 ), and another received Delphic proxenia in the 330 s ( I.Delphes iii . 4 380 -81 ). An Epidaurian theorodokos resided in the city in C4l-C3e ( IAEpid 42 . 3 ). Being a federal foundation, Megalopolis was probably originally a democracy, since the Confederacy was democratic (Larsen ( 1968 ) 180 ). The earliest reference to a public enactment is Diod. 18 . 70 . 1 (r 318 ): οιasper Μεγαλοπολῖται . . . εψηφίσαντο ; IG v . 2 431 . 3 (C4 ) has been restored to refer to a council. A board of damiorgoi is referred to in IG v . 2 431 . 2 ; the office of agonothetes is attested by IG V. 2 450 (C4s). It is as good as certain that a system of six phylai was created at the foundation of the city, but on its functions we have no information ( IG v . 2 451 (C3l-C2e) and 468 (C4 -C3 ) with Jones, POAG 135 -38 ). The public architecture included a bouleuterion (Paus. 8 . 30 . 9 , without indication of its date; cf. Hansen and Fischer-Hansen ( 1994 ) 40 ), a stoa erected by Philip II of Makedon (Paus. 8 . 30 . 6 ; cf. Gardner et al . ( 1893 ) 59 -66 and AR ( 1993 -94 ) 17 -18 , ( 1994 -95 ) 13 ); in addition, Paus. 8 . 30 . 7 has a reference to unspecified αρχεῖα . In the agora (for which see Gardner et al . ( 1893 ) 101 -6 ) there was a sanctuary with a temple of Zeus Soter (C4 ) (cf. AR ( 1993 -94 ) 17 ). The theatre had a seating capacity of c. 20 , 000 (Gardner et al . ( 1893 ) 42 ; TGR ii. 262 -63 ) and was built when the city was founded (Gardner et al . ( 1893 ) 69 , 75 ; cf. AR ( 2001 -2 ) 28 ). Finally, the city housed a C4m assembly hall which served the Confederacy (Paus. 8 . 32 . 1 ; cf. Gardner et al . ( 1893 ) 17 -23 ) as well as the city itself (Tsiolis ( 1995 ) 51 -54 ). So the city was able to house federal institutions, and a federal assembly met in the city in 348 / 7 (Dem. 19 . 10 ; Aeschin. 2 . 165 ); it is unknown,however, whether the assembly met in the city in the 360 s; Harp. s.v. Myrioi states: Μυacuteριοι εν Μεγάληsubiotaη πόλει . . . πολλάκις µ νη µ ονευacuteουσι οιasper ιasperστορικοί , but this need not refer to meetings in the 360 s (cf. Dem. 19 . 10 ; Aeschin. 2 . 165 ). None the less, Braunert and Petersen ( 1972 ) 81 believe that the city was planned as the capital of the Confederacy. The city wall of Megalopolis was erected when the city was founded and was c. 9 km long (Loring in Gardner et al . ( 1893 ) 115 ); it withstood a siege during the revolt of Agis (Aeschin. 3 . 165 ) in 331 , but in 318 certain sections had to be repaired (Diod. 18 . 70 . 2 ). It was a mudbrick wall on a stone foundation (ibid.). The area enclosed by walls measured c. 350 ha; this area, however, includes the river Helisson, which divided the city in two. Since the excavations have been directed exclusively at the agora and the theatre, there is no way of knowing how densely populated this large area was;it is usually assumed that the city was much too large for its population (Gardner et al . ( 1893 ) 116 ). This was certainly the case in C3l (Polyb. 2 . 55 . 2 , 5 . 93 . 5 ); however, as Moggi ( 1974 ) 105 -7 has argued, the extreme lack of population in C3l was probably due to exceptional circumstances. In any case, a drop in population is normally assumed for C3 Arkadia in general (Sallares ( 1991 ) 106 ), and so it is problematical to use the evidence about the C3level of population retrospectively for C4 . Even on the most cautious estimate-that only 100 ha was occupied by habitation and that each ha accommodated only 100 people-the urban population of the city would have been 10 , 000 . Free non-citizens, ξένοι , are referred to by Diod. 18 . 70 . 1 (r 318 ). The patron deity was either Athena Polias (Paus. 8 . 31 . 9 ; Jost ( 1985 ) 230 ) or Zeus Lykaios (Brackertz ( 1976 ) 85 -87 ). In general, the Megalopolitan pantheon reflects the fact that the city was founded by synoecism of pre-existing states: in the city are found several doublets of cults that belonged to the communities from which the city was synoecised (Nilsson ( 1951 ) 18 -22 ; Jost ( 1985 ) 221 -33 , ( 1994 ) 225 -28 ). Most importantly, there was a peribolos of Zeus Lykaios in the agora. Cf. Jost ( 1996 ). In C4m Megalopolis applied to the Amphiktyonic League for membership ( Syll . ³ 224 ). During the 360 s and later, Megalopolis struck staters with obv . Pan; rev . Zeus Lykaios; legend: ΑΡΚ in monogram (Head, HN ² 445 ). A series of triobols and obols with similar types and legends may belong to C4l (Head, HN ² 445 ; Warren ( 1969 ) 39 ; SNG Cop. Argolis 191 -200 ). In addition, bronze coins with similar types and legends were struck (Head, HN ² 445 ; SNG Cop.Argolis 201 -10 ); SNG Cop.Argolis 208 shows Athena and Pan."

The toponym is Μεθυacuteδριον , τό (Thuc. 5 . 58 . 2 ; REG 62 ( 1949 ) p. 6 l. 6 (C5l-C4e); Paus. 8 . 12 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is Μεθυδριευacuteς at Xen. An . 4 . 1 . 27 ; IPArk no. 14 . 6 -7 ( 360 s, from Orchomenos) has Μετιδριήων , which points to an epichoric toponym * Μετίδριον . The only Classical source that possibly classified Methydrion as a polis is Theopomp. fr. 344 . 18 ( = Porph. Abst . 2 . 16 ); at Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 (r 371 ) the city is listed as a polis . The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally on coin legends (Head, HN ² 451 ) and externally in IPArk no. 14 . 6 -7 ; the individual use is found externally at Xen. An . 4 . 6 . 20 . Thuc. 5 . 58 . 2 ( προϊόντες απαντῶσι τοῖς Λακεδαι µ ονίοις εν ΜεθυδρίΩsubiotaω ) suggests that the toponym could designate the territory as well. An inscription from Orchomenos refers to a point where the borders of Methydrion met those of Orchomenos (no. 286 ) and Torthyneion (no. 302 ) ( IPArk no. 14 . 4 -6 ); this allows the conclusion that C4m Methydrion had a well-defined territory and that it abutted those of Torthyneion and Orchomenos; in the fragmentary C5l-C4e Delphic list of theorodokoi, the city is listed just before Torthyneion ( REG 62 ( 1949 ) p. 6 ll. 6 -9 ). According to Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 , Methydrion was in 371 one of a number of communities whose relationship to Orchomenos could be described by the phrase συντελεῖν εις . It is unclear exactly what this means, but Methydrion was presumably in one way or another a dependency of Orchomenos (cf. Hejnic ( 1961 ) 37 -38 ; Roy ( 1972 c ) 78 ; Nielsen ( 1996 b ) 231 -36 ; ( 1996 c ) 84 -86 ). At Petrovouni, 3 km west of the city, a sanctuary has been found; the temple is Heltic, but architectural fragments and votives go back to C7 (Jost ( 1985 ) 215 ). Membership of the Peloponnesian League may be assumed; in 418 , a League army camped in the territory of the city (Thuc. 5 . 58 . 2 ). Membership of the Arkadian Confederacy can be inferred from Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 (r 371 ). It is furthermore not impossible that the synteleia of Orchomenos mentioned at Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 , and of which Methydrion was a part, was an organisation based on formal treaties (Nielsen ( 1996 b ) 234 ). According to Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 , Methydrion was among the communities that the Arkadian Confederacy voted to relocate to Megalopolis (no. 282 ). IPArk no. 14 ( 360 s) seems to demarcate the border with Orchomenos and may be taken to indicate that steps were taken to implement this decision (cf. IPArk on no. 14 ; Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 84 ). However,it is uncertain whether Megalopolis in the Classical period effectively controlled the city, which was clearly not abandoned (Moggi ( 1974 ) 93 -94 ; Nielsen ( 1996 b ) 316 -19 ). In C5l-C4e a Delphic theorodokos resided in the city ( REG 62 ( 1949 ) p. 6 l. 6 ). The earliest surviving reference to a public enactment by Methydrion is I.Magnesia 38 . 61 , which attests to a C3l asylia decree for Magnesia. The preserved fortification wall at Methydrion is Classical, C5 according to von Gaertringen and Lattermann ( 1911 ) 31 , C4 according to Jost ( 1985 ) 213 n. 8 . The wall encloses an area of 11 ha (von Gaertringen and Lattermann ( 1911 ) 31 ). They noted some foundations, sherds and tiles inside the wall, and suggested the existence of a large temple (but gave no date, ibid. 23 , 31 ). The oldest find at the site is an Archaic statuette of Zeus (Jost ( 1985 ) 214 -15 ). According to Theopomp. fr. 344 . 27 -8 ( = Porph. Abst . 2 . 16 ), Methydrion was a small, poor place ( µ ικρουtilde καιgrave ταπεινουtilde όντος τοgrave µ έγεθος τουtilde χωρίου ). Several Arkadian towns, such as Halous (no. 272 ) and Pallantion (no. 289 ), consist of a fortified acropolis with the residential area unfortified below. It is not clear whether Methydrion was such a city; if it was, the fortified area can be equated with the acropolis. Cults of Zeus Hoplosmios and Poseidon Hippios are attested (Jost ( 1985 ) 214 ), and Theopomp. fr. 344 mentions θυσίαι δη µ οτελεῖς and public εasperορταί . According to Paus. 8 . 36 . 2 , citizens of Methydrion achieved Olympic victories before 371 ( Olympionikai 410 -11 ). From Methydrion comes a bronze coinage of, presumably, C4 (Meyer ( 1932 ) 1389 -90 ), though other dates have been proposed, see ibid. and Moggi ( 1974 ) 93 n. 72 . The legend is ΜΕΘΥ∆ΡΙΕΩΝ ; the types show rev . Zeus; obv . Kallisto in the shape of a woman, falling back pierced by an arrow with Arkas on the ground beside her: this type is 'aus Orchomenos entlehnt'(Meyer ( 1932 ) 1389 ); on the significance of this, see Nielsen ( 1996 b ) 234 -36 ."

Byz. 478 . 8 ). In C4m, Nestane may have been a dependent polis inside Mantinean territory; see above Mantinea (no. 281 ) and Hansen ( 1995 b ) 74 , Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 131 -32 , ( 1996 c ) 66 -67 . For the site, see above Mantinea (no. 281 )."
285,Nonakris (Nonakrieus),Arkadia,38.0,22.15,243,1192,"285 . Nonakris (Nonakrieus) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 00 , long. 22 . 15 ; for the location, see Pikoulas ( 1986 a ). Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Νώνακρις , ηasper (Hdt. 6 . 74 . 2 ). The ethnic is Νωνακριευacuteς (Steph. Byz. 480 . 3 -4 , citing Aristophanes = Ar. fr. 861 ( PCG )). Nonakris is called polis three times at Hdt. 6 . 74 . 1 -2 , in the territorial sense. Name and size of the territory are unknown. In Theophrastos' day Nonakris was presumably situated inside the territory of Pheneos (no. 291 ) (Theophr. fr. 160 ; Meyer ( 1937 a ) 860 ); if the city was still in existence, the presumption is that it was a dependent polis within the territory of Pheneos. But it may already have been so in C5 , since Herodotos ( 6 . 74 . 2 ) describes it as a πόλις . . . Αρκαδίας προgraveς ΦενεΩsubiotaῶ . Nonakris was probably an Azanian community (K.Tausend ( 1993 ) 15 ); however, if the Azanians ever formed a political unit, this had broken up before C5 (Roy ( 1972 b ) 44 , ( 1996 ) 110 ; Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 138 ). At the presumed site of Nonakris, Archaic and Classical pottery has been found, together with some poor architectural fragments (Pikoulas ( 1986 a ))."
286,Orchomenos (Orchomenios),Arkadia,37.45,22.2,1705,8382,"286 . Orchomenos (Orchomenios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 45 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: A. The literary form of the toponym is ' Ορχο µ ενός , οasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 605 ; Thuc. 5 . 61 . 4 ; Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 15 ), and the corresponding city-ethnic ' Ορχο µ ένιος . In the epigraphical record we find the toponym ' Ερχο µ ενός ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) ii . 114 ( c. 230 -210 )) with the ethnic ' Ερχο µ ένιος (ML 27 . 4 ( 479 )); the epichoric ethnic ' Ερχο µ ίνιος is found in IPArk no. 15 . 3 -4 ( 360 -350 ) and the toponym is restored [ ' Ερχο µ ιν ] ός in l. 51 (for Arkadian ι for ε before nasal, see Buck ( 1955 ) 145 ). Orchomenos is classified as a polis in the political sense at Hdt. 7 . 202 , 204 , and called polis in the urban sense at Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 11 and Ps.-Skylax 44 , who lists it as the fourth toponym after the heading πόλεις αιasper µ εγάλαι αιasperacuteδε where polis is used in the urban sense; Diod. 19 . 63 . 5 (r 315 ) uses πολῖται . The collective use of the city-ethnic is found externally in ML 27 . 4 ( 479 ) and Thuc. 5 . 61 . 5 , and internally on coin legends (Head, HN ² 451 (C4 )). The individual use is found externally in IvOlb 4 (C4 ) and Xen. An . 2 . 5 . 37 . The territory occupied c. 145 km ² or, according to Meyer ( 1939 b ) 890 , c. 230 km ² . For a short description of the territory, see Jost ( 1985 ) 113 -14 . It was divided into two sub-plains: the southern was the smaller and higher ( 630 m); the northern was larger and lower ( 620 m), but suffered from drainage problems (Jost ( 1985 ) 114 ). The city itself was centred on a hill rising to 929 m and situated in a dominating position between the two plains.A number of sanctuaries in the border zones of the territory are attested by written sources,but none has been securely identified (cf.Jost ( 1985 ) 119 -21 ). Prior to the foundation of Megalopolis (no. 282 ), Orchomenos was,presumably,the centre of an organisation comprising a number of minor poleis dependent on it, among which were Methydrion (no. 283 ), Thisoa (no. 301 ) and Teuthis (no. 298 ) (Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 (r 371 )); exactly how this organisation functioned is unclear, and it is also unclear whether these minor poleis were conceived of as situated within Orchomenian territory. Cf. Nielsen ( 1996 b ) 231 -36 , ( 1996 c ) 84 -86 . The only indication we have of the order of size of the Orchomenian population is the fact that the city fielded 600 hoplites at Plataiai in 479 (cf. Forsén ( 2000 ) 36 -39 ). C4membership of the Peloponnesian League is proved by Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 37 , and can be inferred for C5 on the basis of Thuc. 5 . 61 . 4 , 63 . 2 . At 5 . 61 . 5 Thucydides relates how Orchomenos in 418 joined the quadruple alliance of Argos (no. 347 ), Athens (no. 361 ), Elis (no. 251 ) and Mantinea (no. 281 ): after a siege, the city agreed to join the alliance and give hostages to the Mantineans, and we may therefore consider Orchomenos to be the subordinate party to this treaty.On the other hand, the C4m treaty of sympoliteia between Orchomenos and Euaimon (no. 269 ) ( IPArk no. 15 ) was expressly concluded επιgrave τοῖς ΓaltίσΓaltοις καιgrave τοῖς υasper µ οίοις (ll. 4 -5 ). Although the city at first opposed the Arkadian Confederacy, owing to hatred ( έχθρα ) of Mantinea (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 11 ), Orchomenos did eventually join the Confederacy ( IG v . 2 1 . 46 ( 360 s)). In 480 , 120 Orchomenian hoplites were present at Thermopylai (Hdt. 7 . 202 ), and the next year 600 fought at Plataiai (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 4 ). In 378 / 7 Orchomenos fought a war with Kleitor (no. 276 ) (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 36 ), and in 370 hoplites of the city fought against Mantinean troops in Orchomenian territory (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 13 ). An Orchomenian strategos is implied by Hdt. 7 . 202 and 204 , and a board of πολέ µ αρχοι is attested by IPArk no. 14 . 31 -32 ( 360 s). A citizen of Orchomenos was appointed proxenos by Olbia (no. 690 ) in C4 ( I.Olbia 4 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 17 ) and one by Tegea (no. 297 ) in C4l ( SEG 11 1051 ); the earliest attested grant by the city itself dates to C3f ( SEG 25 443 ). The earliest surviving public enactment is IPArk no. 15 of 360 -350 , a treaty of sympoliteia with Euaimon; the earliest decrees date to C3f: e.g. SEG 25 443 . Execution of citizens is referred to by Diod. 19 . 63 -65 (r 315 ). In C4 we find boards of θεαοροί and πολέ µ αρχοι ( IPArk no. 14 . 30 -31 ( 360 s)). Orchomenos occupied the top and southern slope of the Kalpaki hill, which rises to 939 m.The hill was enclosed with a circuit wall c. 350 -325 (Winter ( 1989 ) 195 ). It has been suggested that there was no proper urban site within the fortifications (Osborne ( 1987 ) 118 ), and certainly no substantial residential area has yet come to light, which, however, may not be very significant since the archaeological investigations have been directed primarily towards the agora, the theatre and the temple of Artemis. Furthermore,it should be noted that von Gaertringen and Lattermann ( 1911 ) 20 concluded that there was habitation within the circuit 'bis tief in die Heltische Zeit' . Cf. Jost ( 1999 ) 240 n. 51 . The city proper seems to have been situated at the foot of the southern slope of the Kalpaki hill (Meyer ( 1939 b ) 890 ) both before the construction of the circuit wall and after its abandonment; here Geometric and Archaic material has come to light (Blum and Plassart ( 1914 ) 81 -88 ), as well as Roman material (Meyer ( 1939 b ) 893 ). Attention has been directed primarily at sacred buildings. At least one and perhaps two temples were built in the Archaic period in the lower city; the building which was definitely a temple measured 31 . 3 × 13 . 3 m with six times thirteen columns; it is unknown to which divinity it was dedicated (Jost ( 1985 ) 118 -19 ; Voyatzis ( 1990 ) 32 -33 ). Pausanias at 8 . 13 . 2 explicitly states that the προτέρα πόλις was on the Kalpaki hill, but that in his day habitation was under ( υasperπό ) the circuit wall, and so far the archaeological material supports this.We may then believe him when he implies that in the Classical period habitation was within the circuit wall. The inference is that in C4 the city was moved from the southern slope to the hill when the wall was constructed (so Winter ( 1989 ) 194 -95 ), although habitation in the former town seems not to have ceased (cf. PECS s.v. Orchomenos,p. 654 ). But the urban history of Orchomenos is by no means entirely clear. The fortification wall encloses the upper part of the Kalpaki hill; it was 2 , 300 m long and enclosed an area of c. 20 ha. It was constructed c. 350 -325 (Winter ( 1989 ) 195 ); however, Thuc. 5 . 61 . 5 , Diod. 12 . 79 . 2 (r 418 ) and Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 13 mention a τεῖχος , but where this ran is unknown. The agora was laid out in a single building programme in C4s (Winter ( 1987 ) 235 -39 ). The northern and eastern edges of the agora were flanked by stoas of C4s; the eastern stoa is sometimes thought to have been a bouleuterion (e.g. Blum and Plassart ( 1914 ) 73 ); but Winter ( 1987 ) 238 -39 thinks that it was simply a stoa. West of the agora is a C4l theatre (Winter ( 1987 ) 235 ; TGR ii. 229 ), and south of the agora, on a terrace supported by a retaining wall is a poros temple of Artemis Mesopolitis (Jost ( 1985 ) 117 -18 ); the preserved remains are probably C4 , but Winter ( 1991 ) 213 suggests that it had an Archaic predecessor. The patron divinity was presumably Artemis Mesopolitis (Meyer ( 1939 b ) 904 ); on the basis of the theatre and a C4l-C3e dedication describing a man as αγωνοθετήσας ∆ιονυacuteσωι and found in the theatre ( SEG 11 1104 ) we may assume the existence of a festival of Dionysos. The Orchomenian mint was late; according to Head, HN ² 451 it began to function immediately after 370 ; according to Babelon, Traité ii. 3 . 624 it began after 362 . The legend is ΕΡ ( SNG Cop. Argolis 267 ), or ΕΡΧΟΜΕΝΙΩΝ ( SNG Cop. Argolis 265 -66 ). All known coins are of bronze. Some interesting coin types show obv . Artemis kneeling, sometimes with a dog behind her, shooting an arrow; rev . Kallisto falling back pierced by an arrow, on the ground beside her her child Arkas, sometimes with his name in monogram ( SNG Cop. Argolis 265 -66 ); these types are found copied at Methydrion, one of the cities thought to have been a dependency of Orchomenos (see Methydrion (no. 283 ))."
287,Oresthasion (Oresthasios),Arkadia,,,527,2573,"287 . Oresthasion (Oresthasios) Map 58 , probably at modern Anemodhouri (see Pikoulas ( 1988 ) 102 ff); lat. 37 . 25 , long. 22 . 10 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is ' Ορέσθειον , τό (Pherekydes ( FGrHist 3 ) fr. 135 a; Thuc. 5 . 64 . 2 ); at Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 (r 371 ) the toponym is ' Ορεσθάσιον . The city-ethnic is ' Ορεσθάσιος ( IvO 147 . 148 ). For a discussion of onomastics, see Meyer ( 1939 c ) 1014 -15 . Oresthasion is called a polis by Pherekydes ( FGrHist 3 ) fr. 135 a and by Eur. El . 1273 -75 , in both cases presumably in the urban sense; Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 (r 371 ) retrospectively lists it as a polis . The external individual use of the city-ethnic is found in IvO 147 . 148 (C5f) and SEG 20 716 . 23 (C4m). The name of the territory was ' Ορεσθίς (Thuc. 4 . 134 . 1 ); its size is unknown.In 423 a battle was fought in the territory between the Tegean and Mantinean Leagues (for which see Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 79 -86 ) at a place called Λαοδικεῖον (Thuc. 4 . 134 . 1 ). Oresthasion was a Mainalian city (Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 ; Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 132 -34 ). The city seems to have been an important centre for assembling Peloponnesian League troops (Hdt. 9 . 11 . 2 ; Thuc. 5 . 64 . 3 ; Pikoulas ( 1988 ) 109 -10 , 205 -11 ); membership of the League may thus be assumed, but it was probably via the Mainalian tribal state (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 100 -1 ). Membership of the Arkadian Confederacy can be inferred from Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 , and was probably again via the Mainalian tribe. According to Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 , Oresthasion was one of the communities that the Arkadian Confederacy voted to relocate to Megalopolis (no. 282 ). It is likely that the city came under Megalopolitan control, but it was probably not abandoned since a surface survey has brought to light numerous Heltic sherds at the probable site of the city, see Pikoulas ( 1988 ) 102 -4 . According to Pikoulas ( 1988 ) 102 , the hill of Groumourou at Anemodhouri, rising to 70 m, was an ideal acropolis for the site at Anemodhouri ( = Oresthasion). The hill-top measures 44 × 30 m; it has yielded sherds and remains of a pre-Classical fortification wall (Pikoulas ( 1988 ) 104 ). According to Pikoulas ( 1988 ) 102 , the megalos archaios oikismos of Oresthasion covered an area of 450 × 200 m. The area is filled with sherds spanning the Archaic to Heltic periods, and column drums lie exposed (ibid.). No remains of fortifications of the lower city are visible. In C5f, in 472 according to Olympionikai 231 , a citizen of Oresthasion won an Olympic victory ( IvO 147 . 148 )."
288,Paion,Arkadia,37.55,22.0,353,1654,"288 . Paion Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 55 , long. 22 . 00 . Size of territory: ? Type: A. The toponym is Παῖον at Hdt. 6 . 127 . 3 (cf. Nielsen and Roy ( 1998 ) 8 n. 17 ). No city-ethnic is attested. The city is called polis at Hdt. 6 . 127 . 3 , and in the same passage πάτρη is implicitly used about it (cf.Hdt. 6 . 126 . 3 , 127 . 3 ). C. 230 -210 a Delphic theorodokos resided in the city ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) ii . 72 ). Paion was an Azanian community (Hdt. 6 . 127 . 3 ); however, if the Azanians ever formed a political unit, this had broken up before C5 (Roy ( 1972 b ) 44 , ( 1996 ) 110 ; Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 138 ). Paion was situated at modern Skoupi. The acropolis was constituted by a small, separately fortified plateau measuring 34 × 65 m (Meyer ( 1942 ) 2399 ). Here Papandreou believed he saw the foundations of a temple and another building ( Prakt ( 1920 ) 125 ). The city wall did not enclose the whole city, but just the upper city (Meyer ( 1942 ) 2399 ). It was 516 m long and possibly dates to C4 (ibid.). A large cistern ( 11 × 8 m) was built into the city wall (ibid.). The extent of the city is not stated by any authority, but there was probably occupation both inside and outside the wall (ibid.). Papandreou seems to believe that the site was of considerable size ( Prakt ( 1920 ) 128 -29 ). Inside the wall there are remains of foundations, and tiles and sherds cover the ground.A plan of the site is found in Papachatzis ( 1994 ) 269 . For a possible suburban temple (undated), see Prakt ( 1920 ) 128 ; a passage in Herodotos connects the Dioskouroi with Paion (Hdt. 6 . 127 . 3 ), but that is all we know about the pantheon of the city."
289,Pallantion (Pallanteus),Arkadia,37.3,22.2,947,4558,"289 . Pallantion (Pallanteus) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 30 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Βαλλά [ ντιο ] ν in a Delphic catalogue of C5l-C4e (Daux ( 1949 ) 6 -8 ) and Παλλάντιον , τό in Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 9 and SEG 11 1084 . 21 -22 ( c. 318 -316 ); the toponym was possibly used by Stesichoros; cf.Paus. 8 . 3 . 2 = Stesichoros; fr. 85 , Davies = fr. 5 , Page. SEG 11 1084 . 6 ( c. 318 -316 ) gives the ethnic as τοιgrave Παλλαντέες ; the singular is found as Παλλαντευacuteς in CID ii 5 . 21 ( 358 ); the MSS of Xen. Hell . have Παλλαντεῖς at 7 . 5 . 5 , but editors often print Παλλαντιεῖς . At Diod. 15 . 59 . 3 the MSShave οιasper Παλλάντιοι or Παλλαντίνοι , but this form is unique (cf., however, the entry in Steph. Byz. with Meyer ( 1949 ) 231 ). According to Meyer ( 1949 ) 231 , the genuine form of the toponym (coined on the basis of the ethnic Παλλαντέυς ) is Παλλάντειον ; this form is found only once,in the great Delphic catalogue of theorodokoi dating to c. 230 -210 ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 7 ). For a discussion of name and ethnic, see Meyer ( 1949 ) 231 -32 . Pallantion is described as a polis in the political sense in SEG 11 1084 . 10 (cf. SEG 25 442 and 33 276 ( c. 318 -316 )), and in the territorial sense (with the political sense as a possible connotation) at Xen. Hell . 7 . 5 . 5 (for which see Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 72 -73 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally on Classical coins ( infra ) and in SEG 11 1084 . 6 ( c. 318 -316 ), and externally in Xen. Hell . 7 . 5 . 5 and SEG 33 276 . 9 ( c. 318 -316 ). The name of the territory is unknown; Paus. 8 . 44 . 5 terms it Παλλαντικοgraveν πεδίον , and it is referred to as polis by Xen. Hell . 7 . 5 . 5 (for which see Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 72 -73 ). Meyer ( 1949 ) 233 estimates its size at c. 30 km ² , but Jost ( 1985 ) at c. 55 km ² . The Suda s.v. Stesichoros states that this poet was an exile from Pallantion ( = Stesichoros Test. A 19 and 35 , Davies). Pallantion was a Mainalian city (Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 ; Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 132 -34 ). Membership of the Peloponnesian League is not explicitly attested, but may be assumed (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 87 , 101 ) and it was probably via the Mainalian tribe. Membership of the Arkadian Confederacy may be inferred from Diod. 15 . 59 . 3 (r 370 ) and Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 (r 371 ). In c. 318 -316 , Pallantion concluded a treaty of friendship with Argos (no. 347 ) ( SEG 11 1084 ). According to Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 , Pallantion was among the communities that the Arkadian Confederacy voted to relocate to Megalopolis (no. 282 ); but, for whatever reason,the decision seems not to have been implemented (Moggi ( 1974 ) 85 -87 ), and the city was not under Megalopolitan control in 318 : in this year the city was captured by Polyperchon, and some citizens were taken captives, but Pallantion negotiated for their release via Argos (no. 347 ), not Megalopolis ( SEG 11 1084 ). According to Xen. Hell . 7 . 5 . 5 , Epameinondas counted on Pallantion as an ally for the battle of Mantinea in 362 , but it is unknown whether Pallantian troops actually fought in the battle. In c. 318 -316 , Pallantion sent an embassy to Argos, and the envoys were all granted Argive proxenia ( SEG 11 1084 . 27 ). In C5l-C4e a Delphic theorodokos resided in Pallantion (Daux ( 1949 ) 6 -8 ). Pallantion was centred on a hill of moderate height; the city proper was situated in the plain at the northern and eastern foot of the hill; it appears to have occupied a considerable area (Frazer ( 1898 ) iv. 421 ). The lower town has not been excavated,but remains of Classical buildings have been found reused, and Classical sherds have also come to light (Jost ( 1985 ) 199 ). A Classical cemetery has also been identified (ibid.). The acropolis of Pallantion was fortified, but the date of the wall has not been established. Inside the wall, on the top of the acropolis and on its southern slope, are no fewer than four modest temple buildings (for which see Østby ( 1995 a )); all the buildings seem to belong to a single programme of construction dating to c. 600 -550 , and later modifications are discernible (ibid. 54 ). According to Head, HN ² 451 , Pallantion began to strike coins c. 400 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 3 . 665 -68 dates the coinage to 421 -371 ; it is a silver coinage on the Aiginetan standard; all known coins have a young beardless male ( = Apollo or the eponymous hero Pallas) on the obv . and the legend ΠΑΛ , ΠΑΛΛΑΝ on the rev . Known denominations are the obol and the hemiobol. SNG Cop.Argolis 270 ."
290,Phara,Arkadia,,,125,573,"290 . Phara Unlocated, but presumably in western Arkadia, see Meyer ( 1957 a ) 82 -86 and Pritchett ( 1989 ) 36 -37 . Size of territory: ? Type: C. The toponym is Φάρα , ηasper in REG 62 ( 1949 ) p. 6 l. 3 . An ethnic is not attested. Phara deserves inclusion in this Inventory solely because it may have had a Delphic theorodokos in C5l-C4e ( REG 62 ( 1949 ) p. 6 ll. 4 -5 ), and thus was possibly a polis (Perlman ( 1995 ) 116 , 121 , 135 ). But the Phara in question may well be that in Achaia (Rizakis ( 1995 ) no. 689 ; cf. Pharai (no. 241 ) in the Achaian Inventory)."
291,Pheneos (Pheneeus),Arkadia,37.55,22.2,861,4142,"291 . Pheneos (Pheneeus) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 55 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: B. The toponym is Φενεός ( οasper / ηasper ; cf. Steph.Byz. 662 . 5 ) in Hom. Il . 2 . 605 ; IG v . 2 360 (C5 -C4 ); SEG 23 189 . 23 ( c. 330 ). The ethnic is Φενεευacuteς in SEG 39 1365 ( 470 -450 ). Other forms are Φενικός and Φενεάτης ; the former may lie behind the Classical coin legend ΦΕΝΙΚΟΝ (Head, HN ² 452 ; Roy ( 1972 a ) 334 -36 ), whereas the latter seems to make its appearance only in C3 (ibid. 335 -36 ). No Archaic or Classical source describes Pheneos as a polis , but Hejnic ( 1961 ) 42 has pointed out that it follows a fortiori from Hdt. 6 . 75 . 1 : Νώνακρις . . . πόλις εστιgrave τηtildeς Αρκαδίας προgraveς ΦενεΩsubiotaῶ , that Herodotos considered Pheneos to be a polis ; Polyb. 2 . 52 . 2 (r 225 ) calls it a polis in the political sense, and Eratosthenes fr. iii B 105 , Berger ( = Strabo 8 . 8 . 4 ) in the urban sense. The collective use of city-ethnic is attested internally on C4 coin legends (Head, HN ² 452 ) and externally in SEG 39 1365 ( 470 -450 ); the individual use is found in IG iv² . 1 96 . 48 (C3f). The territory occupied c. 345 km ² ; this, however, includes Nonakris (no. 285 ), which perhaps as early as C5 was a dependent polis inside the territory of Pheneos (see supra s.v. Nonakris). Its name was Φενική (Polyb. 4 . 68 . 1 ) or ηasper Φενεατικηgrave χώρα (Paus. 8 . 14 . 5 ); Theophr. fr. 160 , Wimmer, suggests that the toponym could designate the territory as well. The territory is termed πεδίον by Theophr. Hist. pl . 3 . 1 . 2 , 5 . 4 . 6 . It must have suffered from severe problems of drainage (Strabo 8 . 8 . 4 ; Baker-Penoyre ( 1902 ); Knauss ( 1990 )). Stangl ( 1999 a ), ( 1999 b ), estimates that the territory could support max. 5 , 000 individuals. In addition to Nonakris and Pheneos itself,the territory included Lykouria c. 4 km south-west of Pheneos, a site that seems to have been a substantial village (Knauss ( 1990 ) 50 -51 ; cf. K. Tausend ( 1999 c )). For Classical watch-towers, see K. Tausend and Erath ( 1997 ) 2 ; K. Tausend ( 1999 b ) 308 -12 . Three extraurban sanctuaries are archaeologically attested (K. Tausend and Erath ( 1997 ); Erath ( 1999 b )). Pheneos was an Azanian community (Steph. Byz. 662 . 6 ); however, if the Azanians ever formed a political unit, this had broken up before C5 (Roy ( 1972 b ) 44 , ( 1996 ) 110 ; Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 138 ). C. 330 an Argive theorodokos resided in Pheneos,and c. 300 ( SEG 23 189 . 23 ) one of its citizens was granted Argive proxenia ( SEG 30 356 ). In Pheneos only the sanctuary of Asklepios in the lower city has been excavated (Jost ( 1985 ) 29 -30 ). It was a city with a habitation area beneath a fortified acropolis. The earliest part of the acropolis wall dates to C4 (Bölte ( 1938 ) 1970 ; Jost ( 1985 ) 31 ); good C5sherds have been found at the site (Simpson and Lazenby ( 1970 ) 91 ). A recent survey suggests that the urban centre occupied c. 20 ha (Stangl ( 1999 b) 178 ). The principal deity of Pheneos was Hermes (Paus. 8 . 14 . 10 ; Bölte ( 1938 ) 1972 -73 ; cf. Jost ( 1985 ) 27 -37 ), in whose honour games were celebrated (schol.Pind. Ol . 7 . 153 a).A festival with games in honour of the Dioskouroi is attested by SEG 39 1365 ( 470 -450 ). Before 460 , Pheneos set up a statue of Hermes in Olympia (Paus. 5 . 27 . 8 ); it was made by Onatas (for whom see Pollitt ( 1990 ) 36 -39 ). Neolaidas of Pheneos won the boys' boxing contest at Olympia c. 392 ( Olympionikai 380 ). The coinage of Pheneos begins C5l ( 421 , according to both Head, HN ² 452 and Babelon, Traité ii. 3 . 598 ). The legends are: ΦΕ , ΦΕΝΙΚΟΝ , ΦΕΝΕΩΝ . The city struck in both silver ( SNG Cop.Argolis 271 -73 ) and bronze ( SNG Cop. Argolis 274 -77 ). Known denominations are hemiobol, obol, triobol, drachm and stater. The most commonly depicted divinities are Demeter and Hermes. The magnificent C4staters depict Demeter (Maia?) on the obv .; rev . Hermes running with the infant Arkas, to which is sometimes added the legend ΑΡΚΑΣ . The staters are collected and described by Schultz ( 1991 ), who dates them to 360 -340 ."
292,Phigaleia (Phigaleus),Arkadia,37.25,21.2,1341,6476,"292 . Phigaleia (Phigaleus) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 25 , long. 21 . 20 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: [A]. The city-ethnic is Φιγαλευacuteς (Hdt. 6 . 83 . 2 ; IvO 161 (C4e)). The toponym is not attested in Archaic or Classical sources; Rhianos apud Steph. Byz. 664 . 10 and Polyb. 4 . 3 . 8 have Φιγάλεια , ηasper , but IG v . 2 419 . 6 ( c. 240 ) and Diod. 15 . 40 . 2 (r 374 ) have Φιάλεια , ηasper ; see further Meyer ( 1938 ) 2065 -67 , who argues for the forms Φιγαλέα and Φιγαλία . Phigaleia is listed (as Φιγαλεῖς Αρκάδες ) as a polis in the political sense in the accounts of the Delphic naopoioi at CID ii 4 . iii . 1 , 45 ( c. 360 ) under the heading τάδε πόλεις καιgrave ιδιῶται επάρξαντο and in Diod. 15 . 40 . 1 , 40 . 2 (r 374 ), and in the urban sense at Polyb. 4 . 3 . 7 . IvO 161 (C4e) uses πατρίς about the city. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in CID ii 4 . iii . 45 ( c. 360 ); the individual use is found externally at Hdt. 6 . 83 . 2 and in IvO 161 (C4e). The territory occupied c. 125 km ² ; its mountainous character is well brought out by Jost ( 1985 ) 82 -83 . It is termed χώρα by IG v . 2 419 ( c. 240 ) and Polyb. 4 . 3 . 7 . A possible inland port on the river Neda is described by Cooper ( 1972 ) 359 -62 . On a promontory overlooking the Neda valley and with city and port within sight is a free-standing C4 watch-tower (ibid. 363 ). Phigaleia probably had a number of second-order settlements; one such, c. 1 km west of the city, is briefly noticed by Cooper and Myers ( 1981 ) 133 , who hypothesise 'a number of satellite villages'(ibid.); one such was associated with the sanctuary at Bassai (Yalouris ( 1979 ) 90 ). At Bassai, on the southern slope of Mt. Kotilion, the sanctuary of Apollo Bassitas or Epikourios (cf. Cooper ( 1968 ) 103 n. 5 ) can be traced back to c. C8s or c. 700 (Jost ( 1985 ) 93 ; Voyatzis ( 1990 ) 43 ). C. 620 -580 a monumental temple was built (for a plan, see Jost ( 1985 ) pl. 22 . 2 ; Kelly ( 1995 ) fig. 1 ) which was oriented north-south. It is possible that the construction of a new temple was begun c. 500 (Yalouris ( 1979 ) 94 -96 ; Jost ( 1985 ) 94 ); however, the famous Classical temple was built in C5s (Jost ( 1985 ) 95 ). It is a Doric peripteral temple measuring 16 . 13 × 38 . 87 m and oriented north-south, with six times fifteen columns, and is built of local limestone (for a plan, see Cooper ( 1968 ) 104 ). A large number of other Archaic and Classical buildings stood within the sanctuary (Yalouris ( 1979 ) 90 ). Just above Bassai, on Mt. Kotilion, two simple temples without peristasis have been excavated (see Jost ( 1985 ) pl. 22 . 3 for a plan). They were presumably parts of a single sanctuary (Jost ( 1985 ) 97 ) that can be traced back to C8 -C7 (ibid.). The temples were erected contemporaneously with the first temple at Bassai, i.e. c. 625 -600 (Cooper ( 1968 ) 103 n. 7 ). For other extra-urban sanctuaries, see Cooper ( 1972 ) 363 -67 and AR ( 1995 -96 ) 12 . K.Tausend ( 1993 ) 16 argues that Phigaleia was an Azanian city, but this is highly unlikely (Roy ( 1972 b ) 44 n. 6 ; Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 160 n. 61 ; Nielsen and Roy ( 1998 ) 33 -36 ); in any case, if the Azanians ever formed a political unit, this had broken up before C5 (Roy ( 1972 b ) 44 , ( 1996 ) 110 ; Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 138 ). Membership of the Peloponnesian League is not explicitly attested, but can be assumed (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 87 , 92 ); the same is true of membership of the Arkadian Confederacy (ibid. 94 -95 ). According to Polyaen. 6 . 27 . 2 , Phigaleia sent an embassy to Argos (no. 347 ) to conclude a symmachia ; Meyer ( 1938 ) 2070 , 2082 , believes that the passage refers to C5l; see, however, Robertson ( 1992 ) 234 -35 , 240 , 243 -44 and esp. 250 -52 , arguing that this passage simply reflects an aetiological mythic complex.The earliest attested treaty to which Phigaleia was a party is Staatsverträge 476 of c. 267 -265 , a treaty between Athens (no. 361 ) and Sparta (no. 345 ) with allies. A citizen of Phigaleia was appointed proxenos by the Aitolian Confederacy c. 270 ( IG ix . 1 13 . 19 ). Phigaleian exiles are mentioned by Diod. 15 . 40 . 2 (r 374 ). From the same passage it can be inferred that Phigaleia was a democracy in 374 (Roy ( 1973 ) 138 ). A system of phylai is attested in IG v . 2 421 (undated); damiorgoi are mentioned in IG v . 2 423 (undated). The agora is mentioned in IG v . 2 421 . 7 (undated); Polyb. 4 . 79 . 5 refers to a polemarchion ; Diod. 15 . 40 . 2 (r 374 ) mentions a theatre.A C4 -C3fountain is found too (Papachatzis ( 1994 ) 352 -53 ). The acropolis was separately fortified (Cooper and Myers ( 1981 ) fig. 4 ); there are no remains on the acropolis (Jost ( 1985 ) 86 ). 'Fortifications embrace a large area, approximately 1 . 5 km north-south and 1 . 3 km east-west' (Cooper and Myers ( 1981 ) 124 ; a plan is found as fig. 4 ); 'Stretches of the circuit may date as early as the 5 th c. B.C. but in the mid 4 th c. B.C. portions were rebuilt' (Cooper in PECS s.v. Phigalia). Meyer ( 1938 ) 2069 supposes that not all the area of the city was actually occupied by habitation, but that the city was built to give shelter to herds of cattle; on the other hand,Cooper and Myers ( 1981 ) 133 note that roof-tiles, some Classical, are scattered across most of the site, indicating habitation and/or other roofed buildings. According to Cooper in PECS s.v. Phigalia, 'considerable remains of the Archaic,Classical,and Roman periods lie exposed' .For a C4 intra-mural temple of Zeus Soter and Athena, see AR ( 1996 -97 ) 47 . A Polias divinity is attested by IG v . 2 421 (undated). The principal deity of the city was Dionysos (Meyer ( 1938 ) 2083 -84 ), in whose honour festivals (Diod. 15 . 40 . 2 (r 374 )) and mysteries (Jost ( 1985 ) 85 with refs.) were celebrated; recently, a C4 intramural temple dedicated to Athena and Zeus Soter has been excavated; at the temple a number of inscriptions were found, among which grants of proxenia to citizens of Megalopolis (no. 282 ) and Byzantion (no. 674 ), etc., and an Archaic votive inscription to Athena ( Ergon ( 1996 ) 41 -47 ). SEG 23 240 is a C4 dedication to Hygieia. Citizens of Phigaleia achieved Olympic victories in C6 ( Olympionikai 95 , 99 , 102 ) and C4 ( Olympionikai 392 ); the latter athlete won three Isthmian victories as well ( CEG ii 826 ). The city as such donated money for the construction of the new temple at Delphi in the 360 s ( CID ii 4 . iii . 45 )."
293,Phorieia (Phoriaeus),Arkadia,,,66,360,"293 . Phorieia (Phoriaeus) Unlocated.Type: C.The toponym is Φορίεια in Steph. Byz. 670 . 7 , who cites Ephor. fr. 55 for the ethnic Φοριαευacuteς . The city's only claim to inclusion in this Inventory is the fact that it had its own ethnic; since sub-ethnics are practically unknown in Arkadia, the ethnic may be a city-ethnic; cf. Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 117 -32 ."
294,Psophis (Psophidios),Arkadia,37.5,21.55,712,3518,"294 . Psophis (Psophidios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 50 , long. 21 . 55 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Ψωφίς , ηasper (Theophr. Hist. pl . 9 . 15 . 2 ; Polyb. 4 . 70 . 3 ). The city-ethnic is invariably Ψωφίδιος (Hecat. fr. 6 ). Psophis is called polis in the political sense in IvO 294 (C4s; see comm. IvO and Meyer ( 1959 ) 1426 ), and in the urban sense at Polyb. 4 . 70 . 4 (r 219 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C5 coins (Head, HN ² 453 ) and externally in SEG 24299 (C6s) and at Hecat. fr. 6 . The territory occupied c. 280 km ² . No second-order settlements are known. The mountains Malea and Lampeia were sacred to Pan (Jost ( 1985 ) 57 ). On Mt.Aphrodision was a sanctuary with several buildings, among which a C5 temple ( 9 . 9 × 7 . 4 m) and a C5stoa stand out; the votives date back to the Archaic period (Jost ( 1985 ) 58 -59 ). According to Paus. 8 . 25 . 1 , the border with Thelphousa (no. 300 ) was marked by a stele with αρχαῖα γρά µµ ατα . Psophis is not attested as having been a member of any larger organisation during our period, but according to Polyb. 4 . 70 . 3 , it was an Azanian community; however, if the Azanians ever formed a political unit, this had broken up before C5 (Roy ( 1972 b ) 44 , ( 1996 ) 110 ; Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 138 ). Paus. 5 . 24 . 2 refers to undatable military activities by Psophis; however, SEG 24 299 is a C6s dedication of a shield by the city at Olympia, indicating that it was conducting military campaigns by that time. No Psophidian proxenoi are known, but at 6 . 16 . 7 Pausanias refers to an (undatable) sculptural group at Olympia which he thought represented Eleian proxenoi of Psophis. Psophis was situated in a remarkable, almost peninsular position between the rivers Erymanthos and Aroanios (see Jost ( 1985 ) pl. 10 . 1 ), a position commented upon by Polyb. 4 . 70 . 7 -10 and well brought out by Pritchett ( 1989 ) 23 -24 . For what it is worth, Polybios at 4 . 70 . 3 calls the city a παλαιοgraveν Αρκάδων κτίσ µ α . For Archaic stray finds from the site, see Jost ( 1985 ) 57 . Several sections of retaining walls can be found inside the circuit (Papandreou ( 1920 ) 138 ).Within the circuit are numerous ancient remains and sherds (ibid. 138 -41 ); some of the larger foundations may be of temples (cf. Jost ( 1985 ) 55 -57 ), and there are traces of a proasteion as well (Papandreou ( 1920 ) 142 ). The circuit wall enclosed an area of 80 ha (Meyer ( 1959 ) 1424 ). It is of Scranton's class C5 (isodomic trapezoidal: quarry face, p. 170 ), which he dates 425 -375 (Scranton ( 1941 ) 85 ). Polybios refers to private houses in Psophis three times ( 4 . 72 . 1 twice ( οικιῶν ), 8 ( οικήσεις )). The acropolis, too, is mentioned by Polyb. 4 . 71 . 11 , 72 . 1 (r 219 ). An acropolis wall is not visible (Pritchett ( 1989 ) 28 ) and there are no ancient remains on the acropolis (Papandreou ( 1920 ) 138 ). Athena Polias is presumably attested on coin types (Jost ( 1985 ) 55 ), and Papandreou ( 1920 ) 139 assumes that Artemis Erykine was the patron divinity of the city. The coinage of Psophis began in C5f (Head, HN ² 453 ). The Classical coinage was in silver only. Known denominations are tritemorion, hemiobol, obol, trihemiobol and tetrobol. The legend is ΨΟΦΙ∆ΙΟΝ or abbreviations thereof. Frequent types are obv . Keryneian stag; rev . fish (with acorn) in incuse square, and obv . head of Athena; rev . club (of Herakles). In C4l the city began to strike in bronze. SNG Cop.Argolis 280 -82 ."

Byz. 538 . 19 mentions a Πυacuteλαι as a τόπος Αρκαδίας ; Meyer ( 1957 a ) 81 connects this place with the ethnic Παρπυλαῖος ( SEG 18 157 (C5 )). If accepted, Pylai may claim inclusion in this Inventory because it had its own ethnic; since subethnics are practically unknown in Arkadia, the ethnic may be a city-ethnic; cf. further Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 117 -32 ."
296,Stymphalos (Stymphalios),Arkadia,37.5,22.3,1300,6209,"296 . Stymphalos (Stymphalios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 50 , long. 22 . 30 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: A. The toponym is Στυacuteνφαλος in SEG 35 371 (C5f); Ps.-Skylax 44 , SEG 36 147 .B fr. d. 7 ( c. 368 ) and Polyb. 4 . 68 . 6 have Στυacute µ φαλος , οasper (cf. ηasper at Paus. 8 . 22 . 2 ), and Hom. Il . 2 . 608 has Στυacute µ φηλος . The city-ethnic is Στυ µ φάλιος (Pind. Ol . 6 . 99 ; SEG 20 716 . 20 (C4m)). Stymphalos is listed as the fifth toponym after the heading πόλεις αιasper µ εγάλαι αιasperacuteδε (where polis is used in the urban sense) at Ps.-Skylax 44 . In the political sense polis is used about the city in, e.g., IG v . 2 352 (C4s) and SEG 32 370 quater ( c. 315 ); πολίτης is found in IG v . 2 351 . 3 (C4l), πολιτεία in IG v . 2 358 (C3f), and πολιτευacuteειν in IPArk no. 17 . 176 (C4l). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found in IG v . 2 352 . 1 -2 (C4l) and on C4 coins (Head, HN ² 454 ); externally, the individual use is found at Xen. An . 1 . 1 . 11 and in IG iv²1 102 A 23 (C4 ), and the collective use in Pind. Ol . 6 . 99 and SEG 20 716 . 20 (C4m). The lake near the city was called ηasper Στυ µ φηλιgraveς λί µ νη (Hdt. 6 . 76 . 3 ); the size of this lake varied, and it sometimes extended to the southern part of the city, which itself occupied the lacustrine plain. The size of the territory was c. 180 km ² . Near Lafka, c. 6 km south-west of the city, is a late Classical/Heltic cemetery,and Doric architectural fragments. Stymphalian membership of the Peloponnesian League may be assumed (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 87 ). Membership of the Arkadian Confederacy is proved by Xen. Hell . 7 . 3 . 1 (Bölte ( 1931 ) 447 ). A treaty of symbola was concluded with Athens (no. 361 ) in C4m (cf. Staatsverträge 279 ; SEG 36 147 ), and one with Demetrias = Sikyon (no. 228 ) in C4l ( IPArk no. 17 ); in C3f a treaty of sympoliteia vel sim . was concluded with Lousoi (no. 279 ) ( IG V. 2 358 ). In SEG 36 147 fr. a. 4 ( c. 368 ) occurs the expression πρ ] οξένων πρεσβ [, which may indicate the exchange of envoys and the existence of proxenia relations between Athens and Stymphalos before the final conclusion of the treaty (of symbola ); see Walbank ( 1986 ) 333 note ad fr. a. 4 and 350 -51 ; Stymphalos granted proxenia to an unknown man in C4s ( IG v . 2 352 ), and had one of its own citizens appointed Delphic proxenos and theorodokos c. 360 ( Syll . ³ 189 ); an Argive theorodokos resided in the city c. 330 ( SEG 23 189 . 24 ). The earliest surviving public enactments are a series of C4s decrees ( IG v . 2 351 -56 ), for which see Taueber ( 1981 ). A death sentence is recorded at SEG 20 716 . 20 (C4m). A boule is attested at IG v . 2 351 and 356 (C4s), and a board of prostatai bolas at IG v . 2 351 ; a board of damiorgoi at IG v . 2 351 too. An assembly ( εκκλησία ) is attested at IPArk no. 17 . 194 ; its ordinary name was probably polis ( IG v . 2 352 (C4s)). The public architecture of Stymphalos is still imperfectly known; the agora has not been located with certainty (H. Williams ( 1984 ) 186 ; but see Bölte ( 1931 ) 443 and Jost ( 1985 ) 104 -5 ). An area of seating cut in the bare rock south of the acropolis suggests the existence of a theatre (H. Williams ( 1983 ) 200 , ( 1984 ) 176 -77 ; cf. Frederiksen ( 2002 ) 67 ). The acropolis is included within the circuit; here three temples are known, not all of them firmly dated, but one possibly dedicated to Athena Polias is C4m (H. Williams, pers. comm.) and has yielded late Archaic and Classical sculpture (H.Williams et al . ( 1997 ) 44 , pers. comm.). Pind. Ol . 6 . 99 uses the phrase αποgrave Στυ µ φαλίων τειχέων , thus suggesting the existence of a C5f fortification; at 8 . 8 . 4 , Strabo mentions a siege of Stymphalos by Iphikrates, which probably occurred in 369 (Du˘ sani´ c ( 1970 ) 332 n. 9 ). The preserved wall is C4m or C4l, and is constructed in mudbrick on a stone foundation (H. Williams and Price ( 1995 ) 8 ; Williams et al . ( 1997 ) 66 ). It was 2 , 300 m long and is described by H. Williams ( 1983 ), ( 1984 ); it seems to have enclosed an area of at least 40 ha (calculated on the basis of H. Williams ( 1983 ) fig. 1 ). According to Paus. 8 . 22 . 1 -2 , old Stymphalos was not in the same place as the known city, but we have no idea about where this can have been (Jost ( 1985 ) 101 , 105 ); however, at the village of Lafka, part of a well-preserved polygonal circuit wall has been found, thus providing a possible candidate for early Stymphalos (H. Williams, pers. comm.). The later city was 'laid out as an orthogonally planned town some time in the fourth century ( = 375 -350 , p. 8 ); it had a sophisticated grid of streets and blocks apparently laid out on a module of 110 Doric feet,or 36 m,for width of street and block, inside a well-built circuit of stone and mud brick walls that encompassed a relatively low acropolis near the lake as well as the flat terrain to the north and east of it' (H. Williams and Price ( 1995 ) 1 ). So far, the earliest pottery from the site is Late Archaic (ibid. 8 ); sufficient Classical pottery has now been found to push the existence of the town back into C5 (H.Williams et al . ( 1997 ) 41 , 43 ; part of the road system may also predate C4 : ibid. 42 ). There is evidence for several late Archaic or early Classical peri-urban Doric temples (H. Williams and Price ( 1995 ) 20 ; H. Williams et al . ( 1997 ) 67 ). Athena Polias is attested by SEG 11 1111 (C4 ), but the patron deity of the city was probably Artemis: she is depicted on coins, and her sanctuary was used for publication of decrees ( IG v . 2 351 . 9 -10 (C4l)). In C5 , Dromeus of Stymphalos was periodonikes (Knab ( 1934 ) no. 3 ). According to Head, HN ² , the coinage of Stymphalos began c. 400 ; according to Babelon, Traité ii. 3 . 593 -94 it began c. 420 . The city struck in both silver and bronze. The legend is ΣΤ , ΣΤΥΜΦΑ (bronze coins), and ΣΤΥΜ , ΣΤΥΜΦΑ , ΣΤΥΜΦΑΛ , ΣΤΥΜΦΑΛΙΟΝ , ΣΤΥΜΦΑΛΙΩΝ (silver coins). Known denominations are obol, triobol and stater. The types depict Artemis, Herakles and the Stymphalian birds. The rev . type of the staters (Herakles with club) is discussed by Schefold ( 1963 -64 ). SNG Cop. Argolis 283 -87 ."
297,Tegea (Tegeatas),Arkadia,37.3,22.25,2712,12732,"297 . Tegea (Tegeatas) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 30 , long. 22 . 25 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Τεγέα , ηasper ( IG iv 510 (C5f); Pind. Ol . 10 . 66 ), or in Ionic Τεγέη (Hom. Il . 2 . 607 ; IvO 268 ( c. 460 )); Diod. 11 . 66 . 3 (r 467 / 6 ) has Τεγέαι . The city-ethnic is invariably Τεγεάτας ( IG v . 2 159 (C5 ); SEG 37 676 (C4f)), of which the Ionic form is Τεγεήτης (Hdt. 1 . 65 . 1 ). Tegea is called a polis in the political sense at Simon. 122 , Diehl = Anth.Pal . 7 . 512 , possibly C5f (Molyneux ( 1992 ) 201 ), or c. 369 (Pritchett ( 1985 ) 217 -19 ), Hdt. 7 . 202 , 204 , and SEG 11 1051 (C4e); in the urban sense polis is used about it at Thuc. 5 . 62 . 2 , Xen. Hell . 7 . 5 . 8 and Ps.-Skylax 44 , who lists it as the first toponym after the heading πόλεις αιasper µ εγάλαι αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense.The territorial sense of polis (with the political sense as a possible connotation) occurs in Xen. Hell . 7 . 5 . 5 (for which see Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 72 -73 ). Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 7 and IG v . 2 39 (C4 ) use πολῖται , whereas IG v . 2 3 . 11 (C5l-C4e) makes a distinction between Γaltαστός and ξένος . There was an Aristotelian Τεγεατῶν πολιτεία (frr. 608 -9 ). IPArk no. 5 ( c. 324 ) uses πολιτευacuteειν at l. 21 , and at l. 28 it uses πολιτικός to distinguish the ordinary lawcourt of the city from an ad hoc court, called τοgrave δικαστήριον τοgrave ξενικόν and presumably composed of citizens from a foreign polis ( IPArk p. 65 ), established to adjudicate the claims of returning exiles. SEG 22 287 (C3 ) uses πατρίς about the city and the poetess Anyte πάτρα ( Anth. Pal . 6 . 153 = Gow and Page ii ). A C4 tile is stamped ∆ΑΜΟΣΙΟΣ ( IG v . 2 170 . 1 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally in IG v . 2 159 (C5 ), and externally in ML 27 . 3 , Hdt. 1 . 65 . 1 and Thuc. 4 . 143 . 1 . The individual use is found externally in Hdt. 9 . 9 . 1 , Thuc. 2 . 67 . 1 , IG i³ 1371 bis ( c. 410 ) and SEG 37 676 (C4f). The territory occupied c. 385 km ² . It is described as a καλοgraveν πεδίον in a C6 oracle reported at Hdt. 1 . 66 . 2 . Its name was ( ηasper ) Τεγεαtildeτις ( χώρα ) (Thuc. 5 . 64 . 4 ; Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 15 ). Hdt. 1 . 66 . 4 calls the territory τοgrave πεδίον τοgrave τῶν Τεγεητέων , and it is termed χώρα at Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 6 . The border with Lakonia is referred to at Hdt. 8 . 124 . 3 ( ουtildeροι οιasper Τεγεητικοί ). Near this border, at Analipsis, was a Classical sanctuary which seems to have been associated with a small settlement (Jost ( 1985 ) 161 ). At Mavriki south-east of the city was a C6 Doric marble temple (Voyatzis ( 1990 ) 29 -30 ). Just north of the city,on Ag.Sostis,is an Archaic sanctuary which perhaps included a C5 temple (Jost ( 1985 ) 155 ). For two C4fortified watch-towers in the territory, see Pikoulas ( 1995 ) cat. nos. 42 -43 . According to Strabo 8 . 3 . 2 , Tegea was (at an uncertain date) synoecised from nine demes, whose names are given at Paus. 8 . 45 . 1 . The nature of the settlement pattern and the political organisation before the synoecism are completely unknown, but the areas of the demes can be roughly located (cf. Voyatzis ( 1990 ) 10 -11 with fig. 2 ); two of the demes,those of the Karyatai and the Oiatai,seem to have been annexed by the Spartans at an early date and to have alternated between inclusion in Tegea and Sparta (no. 345 ) (cf. Shipley ( 1997 ) 233 -34 , 238 -39 ; Nielsen ( 1999 ) 49 ). Tegea fielded 500 hoplites for Thermopylai (Hdt. 7 . 202 ), but at Plataiai the city provided 1 , 500 (Hdt. 9 . 27 . 3 ) in addition to 1 , 500 psiloi (Hdt. 9 . 61 . 2 ); at the battle of Nemea in 394 the city may have fielded upwards of 2 , 400 hoplites (Roy ( 1971 b ) 440 ). Finally, the stasis of 370 sent 800 oligarchs into exile at Sparta (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 10 ). These figures suggest a substantial population, but its exact size cannot be estimated (cf. Forsén ( 2000 ) 36 -39 ), and it is, furthermore, not known how large a fraction of the population resided in the town. According to Hdt. 1 . 66 . 3 , the Spartans in C6f planned to subject Tegea to an exandrapodismos , but were unsuccessful. It is often believed that it was this conflict that led, around C6m, to the conclusion of the treaty Staatsverträge 112 (cf. p. 11 ); an alliance between Tegea and Sparta antedating the Persian Wars is certainly implied by Hdt. 9 . 26 . 2 , but the treaty Staatsverträge 112 is now thought to belong to C5f (Cawkwell ( 1993 ) 368 -70 ; Braun ( 1994 ) 42 -45 ; cf. Osborne ( 1996 ) 287 -89 ). C5membership of the Peloponnesian League can be inferred from numerous passages in Thucydides ( 2 . 67 . 1 , 5 . 32 . 3 , 57 . 2 , 67 . 1 ), and C4membership is proved by, e.g., Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 13 . A C5f alliance with Argos (no. 347 ) can be inferred from Hdt. 9 . 35 . 2 (cf. Strabo 8 . 6 . 19 , who gives a vague chronological reference: µ εταgrave δεgrave τηgraveν εν Σαλα µ ῖνι ναυ µ αχίαν ): Argos assisted Tegea in a battle against Sparta (Hdt.), and Tegea assisted Argos against Mykenai (no. 353 ) (Strabo). The same Herodotean passage allows the inference that Tegea at one point in C5f was the leader of an anti-Spartan alliance comprising all Arkadia except Mantinea (no. 281 ); cf. Nielsen ( 1996 b ) 218 -20 . From Thuc. 4 . 134 . 1 it appears that Tegea, like Mantinea, was the leader of a local alliance; cf. Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 79 -86 . In 370 , T egea joined the Arkadian Confederacy, but only after a bloody civil war which sent 800 oligarchs into exile (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 6 -9 ). Tegea became a leading member providing oecists for the foundation of Megalopolis (no. 282 ) (Paus. 8 . 27 . 2 ). When the Confederacy split in two in 363 , Tegea with Megalopolis remained loyal to Boiotia (Xen. Hell . 7 . 5 . 5 ), whereas Mantinea joined Sparta; Diod. 15 . 82 . 2 refers to Tegea as the leader of the faction opposing Mantinea. Tegean military commanders are referred to at Hdt. 7 . 202 and 204 , and στραταγοί are mentioned in a C4m law ( IPArk no. 3 . 9 ). Five hundred Tegean hoplites were present at Thermopylai (Hdt. 7 . 202 ); 1 , 500 hoplites and 1 , 500 other troops fought at Plataiai (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 3 , 61 . 2 ), and Tegean troops fought at Mantinea in 418 (Thuc. 5 . 67 . 1 ) and at Nemea in 394 (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 20 ). A Tegean envoy to the Persian king is mentioned at Thuc. 2 . 67 . 1 , and according to Diod. 15 . 82 . 3 Tegea in 362 sent an embassy to Boiotia; Tegea received envoys from Corinth (no. 227 ) and Argos (no. 347 ) in 421 (Thuc. 5 . 32 . 3 ) and from Epidauros (no. 348 ) in C4f ( IG iv²1 102 .A. ii . 102 ). In C4e, the city granted proxenia to a man from Orchomenos (no. 286 ) ( SEG 11 1051 ), and in C4m two Tegeans were granted Delphic proxenia ( SEG 31 560 ); in C4 -C3 an Argive theorodokos resided in Tegea ( SEG 33 283 ). A system of four,presumably territorial, phylai is attested, but its functions are unknown; Paus. 8 . 53 . 6 names them Κλαρεῶτις , ' Ιπποθοῖτις , Απολλωνιαtildeτις and Αθανεαtildeτις , and these names occur on a C3 inscription ( IG v . 2 36 ) as ' Ιπποθοῖται , Απολλωνιαtildeται , etc.; Jones, POAG 139 -42 . There was an Aristotelian Τεγεατῶν πολιτεία (fr. 608 ), but there is no direct evidence about the form of constitution; however, a stasis is described at Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 7 ; this stasis brought the demos to power,and it can be inferred that prior to the stasis Tegea was an oligarchy governed in accordance with οιasper πάτριοι νό µ οι ; a θεσ µ ός is referred to in IPArk no. 1 . 8 , 19 -20 (C5 ). The earliest surviving public enactment is SEG 11 1051 of C4e ( έδοξε ταtildeι πόλι τῶν Τεγεαταtildeν ). The eponymous official was presumably the priest of Athena Alea ( IPArk no. 4 n. 1 (C4 )); a board called οιasper Τριακάσιοι ( IPArk nos. 2 . 20 -21 , 3 . 8 (C5l-C4e)) was presumably a council, and one called οιasper πεντέκοντα possibly its executive committee ( IPArk no. 1 . 20 with n. 7 (C5l-C4e)). In addition, there is evidence of boards of θεαροί (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 7 ); δα µ ιοργοί ( IPArk no. 2 . 28 (C5l-C4e)); εσδοτηtildeρες ( = poletai ) ( IPArk no. 3 . 48 (C4m)); and h ιερο µ νά µ ονες ( IPArk no. 2 . 22 -23 (C5l-C4e)). In addition, IPArk no. 2 . 5 attests to a h ιεροθυacuteτας , and SEG 11 1070 (C4l) to an agonothetes . The existence of an assembly can be inferred from SEG 11 1051 (C4e): έδοξε ταtildeι πόλι , for which formula see Rhodes ( 1995 ) 95 -96 . A local calendar is attested by IPArk no. 2 . 29 -30 (C5l-C4e). The layout of the city of Tegea is not well known, though there are indications that by the end of the Archaic period the sanctuary of Athena Alea was at the heart of a well-developed site (Morgan ( 1999 ) 396 -97 ); Ødegård ( AR ( 2000 -1 ) 32 ) refers to various C6s and C5finds from the city area. A circuit wall and two gates are mentioned at Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 8 -9 in reference to 370 ; however, Diod. 12 . 79 . 3 (r 418 ) mentions a poliorkia of Tegea, thus suggesting that the city was walled at this date. Furthermore, at 5 . 62 . 2 Thucydides states that in 418 some people in Tegea were willing to betray the city to the democratic quadruple alliance ( καί τινες αυτοῖς καιgrave τῶν εν τηsubiotaηtilde πόλει [ sc . of T egea] ενεδίδοσαν ταgrave πράγ µ ατα ); if insiders were necessary to conquer the city, we may assume that it was fortified. The preserved remains of the C4e wall show it to have been constructed in mudbrick on a stone foundation (Bérard ( 1892 ) 548 ; cf. V oyatzis ( 1990 ) 12 ); traces of the wall were reportedly found in four places, thus giving a very rough indication of its course (Bérard ( 1892 ) 547 ; cf. V oyatzis ( 1990 ) fig. 3 ), and this course has now been confirmed in its basic assumptions ( AR ( 2000 -1 ) 32 ) except for the fact that the sanctuary of Athena Alea seems to have been outside the wall. The area enclosed by the wall seems to have had the shape of 'an irregular ellipse, with the long axis measuring 2 , 000 metres and the short axis 1 , 400 metres' (Voyatzis ( 1990 ) 12 ; cf. Bérard ( 1892 ) 547 ). It measured max. c. 190 ha. IPArk no. 5 ( 324 ) refers to oikiai , but there is, unfortunately, no way of knowing how densely populated the large area inside the wall was. At 5 . 17 . 2 Polybios refers to the acropolis,but this has so far escaped identification (Voyatzis ( 1990 ) 16 -17 ; cf. Bérard ( 1892 ) 541 -42 ). Little is known about public architecture.Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 36 refers to a desmoterion and to a demosia oikia . There are remains of a C4 theatre (Callmer ( 1943 ) 121 ; TGR ii. 270 ). A C3 inscription refers to the agora ( SEG 22 280 . 24 ). But the most famous Tegean structure was, of course, the temple of Athena Alea; the first monumental temple was constructed C7l (Voyatzis ( 1990 ) 11 ); the Classical temple was constructed c. 345 -335 (Norman ( 1984 ) 191 -93 ). AnAthena Poliatis is attested by Paus. 8 . 47 . 5 and IG v . 2 77 (Roman, but the divinity is presumably much earlier; see Burkert ( 1995 ) 208 ), but the real patron divinity of Tegea was Athena Alea (Voyatzis ( 1990 ) 14 ; cf. Jost ( 1985 ) 142 -65 ). Festivals are attested by IPArk no. 2 . 26 (C5l-C4e) and IPArk no. 5 . 21 -22 ( 324 ); games in honour of Athena Alea are attested as early as Pind. Ol . 7 . 83 (cf. IG v . 2 75 (C6l), 113 (C5e); Jost ( 1985 ) 374 ); a στάδιον χῶ µ α γηtildeς is mentioned by Paus. 8 . 47 . 4 ; a starting line block of uncertain but possibly late Classical date is published by Pakkanen, Tegea Stadium . A Pythian victor is attested for 554 (Paus. 10 . 7 . 7 ), a Nemean for C5 (Dubois ( 1986 ) TE 1 ), and an Olympic for 308 (Diod. 20 . 37 . 1 ). Dedications of Spartan and Persian spoils were set up in the temple of Athena Alea (Hdt. 1 . 66 . 4 , 9 . 70 . 3 ), and in 423 the city sent Mantinean spoils to Delphi (Thuc. 4 . 134 . 1 ); in Delphi, too, the city dedicated Spartan spoils and erected a stoa in c. 369 (cf. SEG 31 558 -59 ; Vatin ( 1988 ) 453 -59 ). According to Head, HN ² 454 , the mint at Tegea began to strike c. 420 ; hoard evidence, however, may point to the Archaic period for the first coinage (cf. IGCH 11 , buried c. 480 ; Hesperia 24 ( 1955 ) 135 -36 ). The city struck on the Aiginetan standard and minted in silver, bronze and iron; the single surviving iron coin (C5s) is discussed by Köhler ( 1882 b ) (cf. also MacIsaac ( 1988 ) 48 -49 ): obv . Gorgoneion; rev . owl + ΤΕΓΕ . Known denominations are hemiobol, trihemiobol, obol and triobol; in addition, a single didrachm is known,for which see Schwabacher ( 1939 ) 15 -18 . The most common types are Gorgoneion, head of Athena Alea and owl. Legends: Τ , ΤΕ , ΤΕΓ , ΤΕΓΕ , ΤΕΓΕΑ , ΤΕΓΕΑΤΑΝ (-ΩΝ ) or ΑΘΑΝΑΣ ΑΛΕΑΣ . SNG Cop. Argolis 288 -313 ."

Size of territory: ? Type: C. The toponym is Τευtildeθις , ηasper (Paus. 8 . 28 . 4 ); the ethnic is Τευθίδας , attested on Heltic coins (Head, HN ² 418 ). At 8 . 28 . 4 Pausanias states that πάλαι δεgrave ηtildeν πόλισ µ α ηasper Τευtildeθις , but the only reason for including it in this Inventory is the fact that according to Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 (r 371 ) Teuthis was, prior to the foundation of Megalopolis (no. 282 ), among the communities whose relationship to Orchomenos (no. 286 ) could be described by the phrase συντελεῖν ες . The other communities so described are Methydrion (no. 283 ) and Thisoa (no. 301 ), both of which were probably poleis . So, by analogy, we may class Teuthis as a possible polis . According to Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 , Teuthis was among the communities that the Arkadian Confederacy decreed to relocate to Megalopolis; it is unknown, however, whether this decision was implemented, and the site seems not to have been abandoned at the synoecism (Pikoulas ( 1986 b )). The city proper lay below the acropolis. The site is now occupied by the village of Dimitsana, and so the degree of ancient urbanisation cannot be estimated; but Pikoulas ( 1986 b ) 116 reports considerable numbers of Archaic and Heltic sherds, but fewer Classical. The acropolis was fortified (ibid. 110 with map 1 at 101 ). The date of the impressive fortification is uncertain, but it is not earlier than C4 and is probably Heltic (ibid. 113 )."

Paus. 8 . 25 . 2 has the toponym Θαλιάδες , αιasper ; the Archaic coinage of the city has the legend ΘΑΛΙ , probably an abbreviation of the otherwise unattested city-ethnic. The only reason for including the city in this Inventory is the existence of this Archaic coinage (Head, HN ² 456 ; Six ( 1888 ) 103 ). The obv . type shows Hermes; attested denominations are obol and tetrobol. SNG Cop.Argolis 317 . Meyer ( 1939 a ) 75 -78 describes 'pseudopolygonale' fortification walls at the site of Thaliades (modern Vaklia), a small temple on the separately fortified acropolis and three further small temples in the immediate surroundings of the city (all four temples undated); the sherds at the site range from Classical to Heltic, but Jost ( 1985 ) 44 refers to earlier material.

300,Thelphousa (Thelphousios),Arkadia,37.45,21.55,1162,5653,"300 . Thelphousa (Thelphousios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 45 , long. 21 . 55 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: B. The toponym shows several variants: ( 1 ) Θέλφουσα ( IG v . 2 412 (Classical)); ( 2 ) Θελ [ φ ] ουacuteσσα ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) ii . 73 ( c. 230 -210 )); ( 3 ) Τέλφουσα , ηasper (Polyb. 2 . 54 . 13 ); ( 4 ) Θέλπουσα , ηasper (Paus. 8 . 25 . 1 ). The ethnic shows the corresponding variations: ( 1 ) Θελφουacuteσιος ( IG v . 2 1 . 64 ( 360 s)); ( 2 ) [ Θε ] λ [ π ] ουacuteσ [ σ ] ιος ( IG iv 727 .B. 13 (C4l)); ( 3 ) Τελφουacuteσιος (Polyb. 4 . 73 . 2 ); ( 4 ) Θελπουacuteσιος (Head, HN ² 418 ). In addition, Steph. Byz. s.v. has Θάλπουσα , Θαλπουacuteσιος . Finally, a C5e dedication at Olympia has καtildeρυξ δα µ όσιος Θελφοίσιος ( SEG 11 1254 a), which points to the form * Θέλφοισα for the toponym. For a discussion of toponym and ethnic, see Meyer ( 1934 ) 1618 . Thelphousa is called a polis in the political sense at SEG 12 371 ( 242 ), and in the urban sense at Polyb. 2 . 54 . 13 ; it is referred to as πάτρα in IG v . 2 412 . 2 (Classical).The city-ethnic is found in the external individual use in IG ix . 1² 31 . 89 (C3l) and Phld. Acad. Ind . 20 . 8 , Dorandi (rC3f); the collective use is found internally on C4 coins (abbreviated to ΘΕΛ : Head, HN ² 456 ) and externally in IG v . 2 1 . 64 ( 360 s). The territory occupied c. 275 km ² and was called Τελφουσία (Lycoph. Alex . 1040 ; Polyb. 4 . 60 . 4 ). Steph. Byz. 306 . 5 describes Thelphousa as a πόλις Αρκαδίας τουtilde ' Ορχο µ ενουtilde . Orchomenos (no. 286 ) seems to have ruled a number of dependent poleis (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 84 -86 ), but there is no other evidence that Thelphousa was one of these (Meyer ( 1934 ) 1619 ). At 8 . 25 . 1 Pausanias mentions a kome by the name of Καουtildeς ; the settlement may have existed by C4e (Jost ( 1986 b ) 644 ), and its raison d'être was presumably to look after the sanctuary of Asklepios Kaousios (Jost ( 1986 a ) 149 ). Kaous, at modern Voutsi, lay 6 . 5 km north of the city (Jost ( 1985 ) 63 ). C. 2 km south of the city Meyer ( 1957 b ) 13 ff found traces of a settlement which includes a C6l-C5e temple and thus existed in the Classical period; it must have constituted a second-order settlement of Thelphousa, possibly to be identified with ancient Onkeion (Paus. 8 . 25 . 4 ; cf. Jost ( 1985 ) 66 ). Another small settlement in the same general area is mentioned by Meyer ( 1957 b ) 15 . For a possible settlement at Bertsia,see Jost ( 1985 ) 67 . A fortress called Στράτος , ηasper was likewise situated in Thelphousian territory (Polyb. 4 . 73 . 2 ; Meyer ( 1934 ) 1619 ). It has not yet been located. The territory was dotted with sanctuaries (see Jost ( 1985 ) 66 (Classical), 67 (Archaic/Classical), 68 (possibly a temple), 68 -69 , 69 (a temple and Archaic votives)). K. Tausend ( 1993 ) 18 argues that Thelphousa was an Azanian community, but certainty is impossible (Nielsen and Roy ( 1998 ) 33 -36 ). In any case, even if the Azanians ever formed a political unity, this had broken up before C5 (Roy ( 1972 b ) 44 , ( 1996 ) 110 ; Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 139 ). Membership of the Peloponnesian League is not explicitly attested, but may be assumed (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 87 ); membership of the Arkadian Confederacy is attested by IG v . 2 1 . 64 ( 360 s). IG v . 2 412 is a Classical epigram commemorating fallen warriors, and may perhaps be connected with the battle fought at Thelphousa in 352 (Diod. 16 . 39 . 6 ). Thelphousian diplomatic activity is implied by the C5e dedication of a herald's staff at Olympia which was inscribed καtildeρυξ δα µ όσιος Θελφοίσιος ( SEG 11 1254 a). The form of constitution is unknown; a Classical epigram commemorating fallen warriors refers to their saving the ευνο µ ίαν . . . πατέρων ( IG v . 2 412 . 6 ). Otherwise the earliest preserved public enactment is SEG 12 371 of 242 , an asylia decree for Kos; it attests to an assembly in the enactment formula έδοξε ταtildeι πόλι τῶ [ ν ] Θελφουσίων . 'Ancient Thelphousa is situated on the left bank of the Ladon about one kilometer north of the hamlet of Toubitsi ' (Pritchett ( 1989 ) 38 ). The city was situated on a hill and covered an extensive area on the lower slopes, not all of which was occupied (Jost ( 1985 ) 62 ). Numerous scattered remains have been found, particularly in the lower city (ibid.). For a plan, see Jost ( 1986 b ) fig. 4 . The only well-known feature of the city is the agora. It was huge, measuring 130 × c. 120 m, and was laid out on an artificial terrace supported by a retaining wall (Jost ( 1986 b ) 638 ). The agora was flanked by stoas on all four sides,the western stoa,however,running for only half the length of the agora; on the southern side, the agora was flanked by a C4stoa which measured at least 78 × 7 m (ibid.).For a plan,see Jost ( 1986 a ) fig. 5 . All in all, the layout and construction of the agora is C4 (Jost ( 1986 b ) 642 ). No monumental structures have been found on the acropolis (ibid. 637 ). The city was walled, and traces of the wall are extant, but have not been investigated separately; cf. Meyer ( 1939 a ) 86 -87 . It may, however, be noted that a Classical epigram ( = IG v . 2 412 ) commemorating fallen warriors probably refers to the wall ( εasperacuteρκεα πυacuteργων ). Thelphousa began minting c. 400 and struck in both silver and bronze, the bronze issues beginning perhaps only c. 323 (Babelon, Traité ii. 3 . 621 -22 ); the legends used are: Θ , ΘΕΛ (Head, HN ² 456 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 3 nos. 935 -39 ). Types: Demeter Erinys, the horse Erion ( = Arion), and later Apollo. The known silver coins are obols on the Aiginetan standard. SNG Cop.Argolis 318 ."

The toponym does not appear until BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 5 ( c. 230 -210 ), which gives Θισόα , ηasper ; the MSS of Pausanias have Θεισόα (which Rocha-Pereira prints) and Θισόα (which Casevitz prints); cf. 8 . 27 . 4 , 28 . 3 . The city-ethnic is Θισοαῖος , which points to the toponym Θισόα ; the ethnic occurs in, e.g., CID ii 5 . i . 23 -24 ( 358 ) and IG v . 2 511 (C3l-C2e). Thisoa is listed as a polis in the urban or political sense at Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 (r 371 ), and refers to itself as a polis in the political sense in IG v . 2 510 -11 (C3l-C2e). The ethnic is found in the external individual use in SEG 14 455 (C4f), for which see Roy ( 1972 c ) 78 ; the internal collective use is found in IG v . 2 510 -11 (C3l-C2e). The name and size of the territory are unknown; Paus. 8 . 28 . 3 ( εν ΘεισόΩsubiotaα τηsubiotaηtilde Μεθυδριευtildeσιν οasper µ όρΩsubiotaω ) and 8 . 28 . 4 ( τηsubiotaηtilde χώρΩsubiotaα δεgrave τηsubiotaηtilde ΘεισόΩsubiotaα ) suggest that the toponym could be used as the name of the territory. At Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 (r 371 ) Thisoa is listed among a number of communities whose relationship to Orchomenos (no. 286 ) could be described by the expression συντελεῖν ες . It is not clear what this means, but it suggests that prior to 371 Thisoa was a dependency of Orchomenos (Nielsen ( 1996 c ) 84 -86 ). Membership of the Arkadian Confederacy can be inferred from Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 ; the same passage claims that Thisoa was one of the communities that the Arkadian Confederacy decreed to relocate to Megalopolis (no. 282 ), but it is not known whether the decision was implemented. SEG 14 455 (C4f) attests to a Delphic grant of proxenia to a Thisoaian; this man could conceivably originate from Kynourian Thisoa (for which see Paus. 8 . 27 . 3 ), but it is more likely that he was a citizen of the Thisoa under discussion (Roy ( 1972 c ) 78 ). Thisoa was located at modern Karkalou. The city proper, unwalled, lay below the acropolis on a plateau (Jost ( 1985 ) 212 ). The acropolis was walled, but the fortification has not been dated; it may be C3 (Jost ( 1985 ) 212 n. 1 ). Remains of buildings have been found both on the acropolis and in the lower city; the oldest remains reported are C3 ( Prakt ( 1911 -12 ) 243 )."

Lat. 37 . 40 , long. 22 . 10 . Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is Τορθυacute [ νε ] ον , τό ( Syll . ³ 90 . 9 = REG 62 ( 1949 ) 4 -12 (C5l-C4e)). The ethnic is found in the genitive plural as Τορθυνήων in IPArk no. 14 . 6 ( 360 s). Though Torthyneion occurs in two Classical sources only, these are enough to establish the community as a probable polis : ( 1 ) Syll . ³ 90 . 9 = REG 62 ( 1949 ) 4 -12 (C5l-C4e) attests the existence of a Delphic theorodokos at Torthyneion, and ( 2 ) IPArk no. 14 . 5 -7 has the ethnic in the external collective use (cf. Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 131 -32 ) and attests to a Torthynean territory with fixed borders: απυgrave τῶι οasperρίοι τῶι . . . τῶν Ορχο µ ενίων καιgrave τῶν Τορθυνήων καιgrave Μετιδριήων κοινοῖ . In 262 , a citizen of T orthyneion was awarded Aitolian proxenia ( IG ix . 1² 17 ). There are clear indications of habitation at Torthyneion, with abundant sherds ranging from the Geometric to the Heltic periods (Howell ( 1970 ) 99 -100 ; Pikoulas ( 1990 -91 ) 140 -43 ). There are remains of fortification walls too (Pikoulas ( 1990 -91 ) 144 -45 )."

The toponym is Τραπεζουtildeς (Hdt. 6 . 127 . 3 ); the ethnic is Τραπεζουacuteντιος (Paus 8 . 27 . 5 (r 371 )). Trapezous is called polis in the urban or political sense at Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 (r 371 ) and-implicitlyπάτρη at Hdt. 6 . 127 . 3 . The collective use of the ethnic is found at Paus. 8 . 27 . 5 (r 371 ), probably taken over from a historiographic source. The territory is called χώραΤραπεζουντία at Paus. 8 . 29 . 1 . According to Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 , Trapezous was among the communities that the Arkadian Confederacy decreed to relocate to Megalopolis (no. 282 ); however, the Trapezountioi resisted the decision, but a part of the population was relocated by use of force, whereas another part left the Peloponnese (Paus. 8 . 27 . 5 ). The synoecism thus meant the end of the city's existence (cf. Meyer ( 1937 b ) 2213 ). ## II. The Poleis"
304,Ep(e)ion,Triphylia,37.35,21.5,434,2136,"304 . Ep(e)ion Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 21 . 50 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is /acuteΕπιον (Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 ), τό (cf. Steph. Byz. 302 . 16 , who enters it as /acuteΗπιον ); Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 has /acuteΗπειον , and Polyb. 4 . 77 . 9 has Αίπιον . A cityethnic is attested only in Steph. Byz. Ep(e)ion is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 31 uses polis of the city twice, first in the urban, then in the political sense, in both cases with the territorial sense as a connotation; and a comparison between Hell . 3 . 2 . 23 and 31 shows that Xenophon thought of Ep(e)ion as a polis in the political sense too (Nielsen ( 1995 ) 88 ). The territory is termed χώρα by Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 . From Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 and Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 23 , 31 it appears that in C5s (at the latest) Ep(e)ion was a perioikic community of Elis (no. 251 ) (Roy ( 1997 ) 283 -85 ). Xenophon attributes to the Eleians the claim that they had originally bought the territory of Ep(e)ion from τῶν τότε εχόντων τηgraveν πόλιν ( Hell . 3 . 2 . 31 ). The identity of these 'holders' is unknown; Xenophon's phrasing suggests that, at the time of the sale, Ep(e)ion was not controlled by its own original population; Niese ( 1910 ) 7 suggested that it was held by Arkadians (cf. Roy ( 1997 ) 290 ). C. 400 Ep(e)ion was liberated from Eleian rule and made autonomos (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 31 ); presumably the city now joined the Triphylian Federation and through it,in 369 at the latest, the Arkadian Confederacy (Nielsen ( 1997 ) 152 -54 ). Pritchett ( 1989 ) 57 (followed by Barr .) located Ep(e)ion at modern Trypiti (formerly Bitsibardi).Here are 'a good sprinkling of sherds,convincing evidence for a settlement' ,the stylobate foundations of an ancient structure, a retaining wall and many tiles (Pritchett ( 1989 ) 52 ). Earlier scholars have noted walls of ashlar masonry, tiles and pottery of the Classical period, as well as blocks and column drums (ibid. 51 ). The acropolis covers an area of 150 × 25 m.The oldest find noted thus far is an Archaic sima (Papakonstantinou ( 1982 ))."

Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 ), τό (Strabo 8 . 3 . 24 ). The city-ethnic is ' Επιταλιευacuteς (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 25 ). Epitalion is called a polis in the political sense by Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 . The city-ethnic is found in the external collective use at Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 25 . The territory is termed χώρα by Strabo 8 . 3 . 24 . It appears from a combination of Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 20 , 25 and 30 that by C5l (at the latest) Epitalion was a perioikic community of Elis (no. 251 ) (cf. Roy ( 1997 ) 283 -85 ). During the war between Sparta (no. 345 ) and Elis c. 400 Epitalion seceded from Elis and joined Sparta (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 25 ). The Spartans placed a garrison and a harmost in the city with some Eleian refugees after the second Spartan invasion of Elis (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 29 ). According to Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 , Epitalion was formally liberated from Eleian rule by the peace treaty concluded between Sparta and Elis after the war (Nielsen ( 1997 ) 137 -39 ); it is a safe inference from Xenophon's description of the city as a Τριφυλιgraveς πόλις ( Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 ) that Epitalion now joined the Triphylian Federation with which it presumably joined the Arkadian Confederacy c. 369 (Nielsen ( 1997 ) 153 -55 ). The site of Epitalion, at modern Aghulinitsa, has as yet yielded no Archaic or Classical finds, though the Heltic and Roman town has been found (Themelis ( 1968 ); Papachatzes ( 1982 ) 223 ; Pritchett ( 1989 ) 75 -76 )."

Aves 149 ( τοgraveν ' Ηλεῖον Λέπρεον ) presupposes the masculine (cf. Paus. 5 . 5 . 3 ). The city-ethnic is Λεπρεάτας (-της ); Heracl. Lemb. 42 has Λεπρεεῖς as if from * Λεπρεευacuteς . Lepreon is called a polis in the urban sense by Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 and Aristotle (Heracl. Lemb. 42 ; Arist. no. 99 , Gigon) and in the political sense by Thuc. 5 . 31 . 5 . The city-ethnic is attested epigraphically in the external collective use on the Serpent Column (ML 27 . 11 ) and in IG v . 2 1 . 20 ( 360 s); in literature it is found at Hdt. 9 . 28 . 4 , Thuc. 5 . 31 quater , Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 25 and Ps.-Skylax 44 . The external individual use is found in Dubois ( 1986 ) Phi. 5 . 2 (C3 ). Patris is found in CEG ii 382 (C5f; completely restored). The territory of Lepreon is described as χώρα in Ps.Skylax 44 , and as γηtilde by Thuc. 5 . 31 . 2 , 3 . Sometime before the Peloponnesian War the city ceded half its territory to the Eleians as part of a treaty of symmachia and now had to pay 1 tal. (presumably each year) for the right to exploit this part of the territory (Thuc. 5 . 31 . 2 ; Staatsverträge 164 ). According to Strabo 8 . 3 . 30 , Lepreon at some point absorbed Pylos by synoecism (Moggi, Sin . 168 proposes a date c. 460 ; cf. Demand ( 1990 ) 64 ). There were a number of second-order settlements in the territory of Lepreon: one was associated with a large temple at Prasidaki (see infra ) unless this was in fact Pyrgos (no. 310 ), as suggested by Arapogianni ( 1999 ) 168 , itself a polis ( infra ). East of modern Tholo is a settlement which existed from the Archaic period (Yalouris ( 1973 ) 158 ; cf. Pritchett ( 1989 ) 75 ; Müller ( 1987 ) 839 -40 ). At modern Kakovatos Classical sherds are reported by Yalouris ( 1973 ) 164 . At 5 . 49 . 1 , Thucydides mentions a teichos called Phyrkon which must have been in Lepreatan territory (see HCT ad loc .). A fortress that is a possible candidate for Strabo's Χάα ( 8 . 3 . 21 ) is briefly discussed by Pritchett ( 1989 ) 61 -62 ; it may have existed in the Classical period. A temple by the river Neda, at modern Prasidaki, is thought to have belonged to Lepreon (Pritchett ( 1989 ) 60 n. 138 ; see, however, Arapogianni ( 1999 ) 168 , suggesting that Prasidaki was in fact Pyrgos).It was a monumental Doric limestone temple of the late Classical period; it had an Archaic predecessor; the votives at the site go back to C7m and,according to Yalouris, there was an αξιόλογος αρχαίος οικισ µ ός associated with the temple, which thus was perhaps situated in a secondorder settlement of Lepreon (Yalouris ( 1971 ); cf. Yalouris ( 1973 ) 155 , reporting remains of a wall and many buildings). The temple was dedicated to Athena Agorios (Arapogianni ( 1999 ), who interprets the epithet as equivalent to Agoraios ). Lepreon provided 200 hoplites for the battle of Plataiai in 479 (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 4 ), but this is the only indication we have for the order of size of the population. Lepreon was a member of the Hellenic League against Persia (ML 27 . 11 ; Hdt. 9 . 28 . 4 ); in C5s the city was a perioikic community of Elis (cf. Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 23 , 25 ; Paus. 3 . 8 . 3 ; Roy ( 1997 ) 283 -85 ). The city was briefly liberated from Eleian rule by Sparta (no. 345 ) in 421 and received a Spartan garrison (Thuc. 5 . 31 . 4 ; cf. 5 . 34 . 1 ; Roy ( 1998 ); Hunt ( 1998 ) 174 ; Falkner ( 1999 )); however, the city was reconquered by Elis (no. 251 ) before the end of C5 (cf. Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 23 , 25 ), but must have been liberated again by the peace treaty concluded between Elis and Sparta c. 400 (Roy ( 1997 ) 291 ). Nothing is known with certainty about the position of Lepreon in the united Triphylian state of c. 400 -369 , but it was probably the central city of Triphylia, since it seems that Lepreon represented Triphylia in the Arkadian Confederacy of which it is securely attested as a member ( IG v . 2 1 . 20 ( 360 s); Nielsen ( 1997 ) 153 -54 ). Nothing is known about the form of constitution, but there was an Aristotelian treatise on the politeia of Lepreon; the only surviving fragment attests to the existence of laws on adultery, on atimia and on admission to citizenship (Heracl. Lemb. 42 ; Arist. no. 99 , Gigon). Lepreon was situated on a steep hill north of modern Lepreo (formerly Strovitzi), c. 7 km from the coast. The acropolis was fortified; the remains are mostly of the Heltic period, but an earlier phase may be C4 ( PECS s.v. Lepreon, 499 ). On the acropolis was a Doric temple of Demeter dating to c. 375 -350 ; it was without sculptural ornamentation but had a predecessor (Knell ( 1979 ), ( 1983 )). The lower city was fortified too (Pritchett ( 1989 ) 60 ), but the wall has not been dated. The extent of the lower city was considerable, according to Frazer ( 1898 ) iii. 474 (cf. Pritchett ( 1989 ) 59 ). Heracl. Lemb. 42 refers to an agora. In the Classical period, Lepreon may have produced as many as seven Olympic victors: Olympionikai 267 ( c. 460 ); nos. 276 , 309 ( c. C5m); no. 331 ( 424 ); no. 338 ( 420 ); no. 360 ( c. 400 ); no. 405 ( c. 376 ); no. 426 ( c. 360 ). Furthermore, Antiochos ( Olympionikai 360 ) was victorious in the pentathlon twice in both the Isthmian Games (cf. Nielsen, Lepreon ) and the Nemean Games."
307,Makiston (Makistios),Triphylia,37.35,21.4,711,3346,"307 . Makiston (Makistios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 21 . 40 . Size of territory: possibly 3 . Type: A. The toponym is found mostly in oblique cases in the Classical period: Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 gives Μάκιστον in the accusative, Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 Μακίστου in the genitive; Arist. Heracl. Lemb. 55 and a C3 inscription (for which see AR ( 1996 -97 ) 49 ) have ΜακίστΩsubiotaω in the dative; thus the gender is unknown. Strabo has τοgrave Μάκιστον at 8 . 3 . 18 , but τοgraveν Μάκιστον at 8 . 3 . 16 ; Steph. Byz. at 428 . 11 gives Μάκιστος without source reference; however, at 450 . 3 he cites Hekataios ( = FGrHist 1 , fr. 122 ) for the form Μήκιστον , which tips the balance in favour of the neuter for C5 . The city-ethnic is Μακίστιος ( SEG 35 389 . 2 -3 ( c. 399 -369 ); Xen. An . 7 . 4 . 16 ). Schol. Eur. Or . 4 has εν ΤριφυλίΩsubiotaα . . . εν ΜακέστΩsubiotaω , and correspondingly Steph. Byz. 428 . 14 -15 states: τοgrave εθνικοgraveν . . . ευasperacuteρηται καιgrave Μακέστιος διαgrave τουtilde ε ψιλουtilde . Makiston is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 ; there is no attestation of polis in the political sense specifically applied to Makiston, but from Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 and Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 23 , 25 it appears that Makiston was one of the perioikides poleis of Elis (no. 251 ) (Roy ( 1997 ) 283 -85 ); for the urban and territorial senses combined, see Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 (for the idiom, cf. Diod. 2 . 43 . 6 , and see Smyth, Greek Grammar § 1096 ); πολιτευacuteεσθαι is attested in SEG 35 389 ( c. 399 -369 ). The external collective use of the city-ethnic is attested in SEG 35 389 . 2 -3 ( c. 399 -369 ) and at Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 25 ; Paus. 6 . 22 . 4 provides an instance referring to C6f. The external individual use is found in Xen. An . 7 . 4 . 16 ( Σιλανοgraveς Μακίστιος ). It is likely that the city controlled the sanctuary of Poseidon Samios at Samikon (Strabo 8 . 3 . 13 ; Bölte ( 1930 ) 777 -78 ; Tausend ( 1992 ) 19 -21 ). In C5s (at the latest) Makiston was a perioikic community of Elis (cf. Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 and Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 23 , 25 ; Roy ( 1997 ) 283 -85 ); in the period c. 400 -369 Makiston was a member of the Triphylian federation ( SEG 35 389 ( c. 399 -369 )), an organisation that was capable of granting Makistian citizenship to foreigners ( SEG 35 389 ; cf. Nielsen ( 1997 ) 149 ); magistracies ( τέλεα ) and a nomos are attested for C4f (ibid.; cf. Siewert ( 1987 ) 276 ). The city presumably joined the Arkadian Confederacy with the rest of Triphylia c. 369 at the latest (Nielsen ( 1997 ) 152 -55 ). Makiston was presumably situated at modern Mázi (Pritchett ( 1989 ) 65 ; followed by Barr .); this site was a large town and there are remains of houses and probably of public buildings (Trianti ( 1985 ) 22 ). Two burial areas of C4 have been excavated (ibid.); the acropolis was fortified (Trianti ( 1985 ) 21 ; Pritchett ( 1989 ) 68 ) and contained a Doric peripteral temple, probably of C5e (Trianti ( 1985 ) 23 -24 ); the temple was presumably dedicated to Athena (ibid. 24 -33 ). After c. 400 -369 ( SEG 35 389 ) the city is mentioned as existing only once ( AR ( 1996 -97 ) 49 (C3 )), and it is absent from Polybios' list of Triphylian cities at 4 . 77 . 9 ; it may have ceased to exist by 219 , the date to which Polybios' description of Triphylia refers."
308,Noudion,Triphylia,,,62,320,308 . Noudion Unlocated. Type: A. The toponym is Νουacuteδιον at Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 . A city-ethnic is not attested. Noudion is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 . Herodotos is the only source to mention Noudion; it may possibly have been destroyed by the Eleians during their expansion into Triphylia.
309,Phrixa(i),Triphylia,37.4,21.45,339,1563,"309 . Phrixa(i) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 40 , long. 21 . 45 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Φρίξαι , αιasper in Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 has Φρίξα , ηasper (as Polyb. 4 . 77 . 9 ). Strabo 8 . 3 . 12 has Φρίξη . A city-ethnic is unattested apart from the entry in Steph. Byz. The territory was possibly homonymous with the city (Strabo 8 . 3 . 12 ). Phrixa(i) is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 and in the political sense at Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 . In C5m Phrixa(i) seems to have been considered to be Arkadian (Pherekydes ( FGrHist 3 ) fr. 161 ), but from a combination of Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 and Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 23 , 30 it appears that in C5l (at the latest) the city was a perioikic community of Elis (no. 251 ) (Roy ( 1997 ) 283 -85 ). However, according to Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 , Phrixa(i) was formally liberated from Eleian rule by the peace treaty concluded between Sparta (no. 345 ) and Elis after their war in c. 400 ; it is a safe inference from Xenophon's description of the city as a Τριφυλιgraveς πόλις ( Hell . 3 . 2 . 30 ) that Phrixa(i) now joined the Triphylian Federation with which it presumably entered the Arkadian Confederacy c. 369 (Nielsen ( 1997 ) 152 -54 ). Phrixa(i) was located on a steep hill on the left bank of the river Alpheios (Pritchett ( 1989 ) 70 -71 ; followed by Barr .). Yalouris describes the site as a Classical town with an acropolis, and reports remains of walls, abundant sherds and tiles, and the foundations of a large building (Y alouris ( 1973 ) 170 -71 )."
310,Pyrgos,Triphylia,,,435,2214,"310 . Pyrgos Map 58 . Barr . follows Müller ( 1987 ) 839 -40 in identifying Pyrgos with the Pyrgoi of Strabo 8 . 3 . 22 and locating it at Ag. Ilias south-west of Lepreon at lat. 37 . 25 , long. 21 . 40 ; Arapogianni ( 1999 ) 168 identifies Pyrgos with the site at Prasidaki; here, however, both these sites are considered second-order settlements of Lepreon (no. 306 ), and Pyrgos is located at Bambes in accordance with Pritchett ( 1989 ) 73 -75 , more or less where Barr . puts 'Selinous' (cf. Lauffer ( 1989 ) 352 -53 ), at lat. 37 . 35 , long. 21 . 35 . Size of territory: ? Type: A. The toponym is Πυacuteργος , οasper at Hdt. 148 . 8 and Polyb. 4 . 77 . 9 , 80 . 13 (both giving the accusative without article, though). The city-ethnic is unattested. Pyrgos is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 ; Polyb. 4 . 77 . 9 describes it as a polis too,and c. 230 -210 a Delphic theorodokos resided in Pyrgos. (If Pyrgos is identified with Bambes ( infra ), then the Delphic theorodokos εν Πυacuteργωι (for which see Oulhen ( 1992 ) 43 , l. 89 ) presumably resided in Herodotos' Pyrgos, since Phrixa(i), located only 5 km northeast of Bambes, is the next Triphylian entry in the list.) In C5 Pyrgos was probably the victim of Eleian aggression (Hdt. 4 . 148 . 4 ), but apart from that nothing is known about the political history of the city in the Archaic and Classical peri- ods; it may be assumed, however, that it became a perioikic dependency of Elis (no. 251 ) (Roy ( 1997 ) 283 -85 ), was liberated c. 400 , joined the Triphylian Federation and through it the Arkadian Confederacy (Nielsen ( 1997 ) 152 -54 ). Pyrgos was probably located at modern Bambes (Pritchett ( 1989 ) 73 -75 ). Here a small C5e temple of Zeus has been found, situated on a hill (Yalouris ( 1954 ) 290 ). Around the hill have been found four groups of houses, thus revealing a city of C5s (ibid. 291 ) with traces of earlier occupation (Yalouris ( 1958 ) 194 ).According to the excavator,the site was an important city occupying a considerable area, which has yielded Archaic and Classical pottery as well as displaced Archaic and Classical Doric columns (Yalouris ( 1956 ) 187 , 191 ; Y alouris ( 1958 ) 194 , 198 )."
311,Skillous (Skillountios),Triphylia,37.35,21.35,518,2541,"311 . Skillous (Skillountios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 21 . 35 . Size of territory: ? Type: A. The toponym is Σκιλλουtildeς , οasper (Xen. An . 5 . 3 . 7 , 8 ; Paus. 5 . 6 . 6 ). The city-ethnic is Σκιλλουacuteντιος (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 2 ). Siewert ( 1991 ) 82 restores IvO 930 Σκι [ λλόντιοι ]. The territory of the city is called ηasper γηtilde ηasper Σκιλλουντία at Paus. 5 . 6 . 6 , but the toponym could presumably also be used to denote the territory (Paus. 5 . 6 . 6 : παρέχεται δεgrave οasper Σκιλλουtildeς καιgrave άγρας θηρίων κτλ ). Skillous is-presumably-repeatedly referred to as a polis in the political sense in IvO 16 ( c. 450 -425 ) (for which see Koerner ( 1993 ) no. 44 at 130 and Roy ( 1997 ) 296 ). Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 2 describes Skillous as a polis in the political sense too, and Xen. An . 5 . 3 . 7 -8 twice uses πολῖται about the inhabitants. The city-ethnic is found in the external collective use in IvO 16 and Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 2 ; Paus. 6 . 22 . 4 provides an instance referring to C6f. In C5s Skillous was presumably a perioikic community of Elis (no. 251 ) (Roy ( 1997 ) 283 -85 ); if so, it must have been liberated from Eleian rule by the peace treaty concluded by Sparta (no. 345 ) and Elis after their war in C5l-C4e (for which see Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 23 -31 ), and it may have joined the new Triphylian Federation and through it the Arkadian Confederacy (Nielsen ( 1997 ) 152 -54 ); a board of officials ( damiorgoi ) is attested for C5m ( IvO 16 ; Koerner ( 1993 ) 130 ). However, not much is known about the history of Skillous in C4e, apart from the fact that Xenophon lived there; according to An . 5 . 3 . 7 , he was settled there by the Lakedaimonians ( υasperποgrave τῶν Λακεδαι µ ονίων οικισθέντος ), but it is not clear how the Lakedaimonians could grant land in a foreign polis unless they did so with Skillountian acceptance and collaboration (cf. Hunt ( 1998 ) 174 ). Skillous may have granted citizenship to Xenophon: in An . 5 . 3 . 10 he refers to his own sons and those of τῶν άλλων πολιτῶν which seems to indicate that Xenophon too was a citizen; if so, it may be suggested that he served as proxenos of the Lakedaimonians at Skillous,since at Diog.Laert. 2 . 51 it is reported that αυτΩsubiotaῶ προξενίαν έδοσαν οιasper Λακεδαι µ όνιοι but not in which state. In 371 , the Eleians claimed that Skillous was a polis belonging to them, but the implications of this claim are uncertain (Tuplin ( 1993 ) 183 -85 ). After 371 , Skillous disappears from the records. ## II. The Poleis"
312,Aithaia (Aithaieus),Messenia,,,498,2604,"312 . Aithaia (Aithaieus) Unlocated. Type: B. (S 18 ). The toponym is probably Αίθαια (Philoch. fr. 32 a apud Steph. Byz. 46 . 4 ; vv.ll . Αιθαία , Αιθάλα ); Θέα at Philoch. fr. 32 b ( apud Steph. Byz. 308 . 4 s.v. Θεά , also citing Thuc.), is probably a doublet. The city-ethnic is probably Αιθαιευacuteς (Thuc. 1 . 101 . 2 ; vv.ll . Αιθαλευacuteς , Αιθεεῖς , Αιθνεεῖς ; restored on the basis of Steph. Byz. 46 . 5 , who attributes it to Thuc.). Aithaia is not located with certainty, but may have been near Thouria (no. 322 ) in south-eastern Messenia, the only other perioikic polis to revolt in 465 (Thuc. 1 . 101 . 2 ). Valmin ( 1930 ) 61 -64 suggests Samarina (Santa Marina), north-east of the village of Kalogeraki (or rather Kalogerorachi: see MME 314 ), or one of several sites in the vicinity, such as Karteroli further south (Mycenaean, Heltic). See also Roebuck ( 1941 ) 30 -31 and 7 n. 16 ; Lazenby ( 1972 ) 86 ; Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 94 and 98 n. 95 . One possible site is MME no. 137 , Ellinika Aithaias (at Aithaia, formerly Delimimi, ΛΟΠ no. 304 : Meyer ( 1978 ) 183 ); but this is more probably Thouria (no. 322 ). If it is Karteroli, it had a Heltic existence and so did not cease to exist after the liberation of Messenia; but nothing is known about the status of Aithaia after C5 . Aithaia is never called a polis in Classical sources, but apparently it was by Philoch. fr. 32 a, who included it as 'one of the 100 ' . It may be assumed to have been a perioikic polis during Spartan rule on the basis of Thuc. 1 . 101 . 2 , the only Archaic or Classical use of the city-ethnic (external collective). There is no evidence for the name or extent of its territory; it is assigned to Lakonike in Philoch. fr. 32 a (as is Thea, its possible double, in fr. 32 b). Unlike Mothone (no. 319 ) and Asine (no. 313 ), Aithaia is not said to have been the home of exiles from another polis . The ethnic affiliation of its population therefore depends on whether the perioikoi in Messenia were originally Lakedaimonians, even Spartiates, or ethnic Messenians ¹² References to komai in Laconia and Messenia are assembled by Shipley ( 1997 ) 261 -63 . elevated above their helot compatriots. Malkin ( 1994 ) 85 tentatively advances Thouria (no. 322 ) and Aithaia as possible C8foundations.Lazenby ( 1972 ) 86 assumes that the people of Thouria and elsewhere were still 'free Messenians' after the conquest. Given its possible location, it would have been detached from Sparta (no. 345 ) in 338 rather than 369 . Lazenby ( 1972 ) 90 suggests it may have belonged to a Messenian koinon after 338 / 7 ."
313,Asine (Asinaios),Messenia,36.45,21.55,1009,5027,"313 . Asine (Asinaios) Map 58 . Lat. 36 . 45 , long. 21 . 55 . Size of territory: 2 or 3 . Type: [A]. (S 19 ). The toponym is Ασίνη , ηasper (Hdt. 8 . 73 . 2 ; Thuc. 4 . 13 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 25 ; Ps.-Skylax 46 ). Although Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 25 places it in Λάκαινα , the Messenian town is presumably meant, since Lakaina is probably equivalent to Lakonike , the territory controlled by Sparta (no. 345 ); it is explicitly distinguished from Laconian Asine at e.g. Strabo 8 . 4 . 1 ( τηtildeς Μεσσηνιακηtildeς Ασίνης ) and Steph. Byz. 131 . 11 -13 ( Ασίνη , πόλις Λακωνικηgrave . . . δευτέρα Μεσσήνης παραgrave τηgraveν Λακωνικήν ). The city-ethnic is Ασιναῖος (Xen. An . 5 . 3 . 4 ; Hell . 7 . 1 . 25 ; IG ii² 8387 a (C4 )); it is specified as Ασιναῖος εγ Μεσσαν [ ίας ] in SEG 12 219 = BCH 77 ( 1953 ) 166 (Delphi, 322 -310 ). Paus. 4 . 34 . 12 locates Asine 40 stades ( 7 . 3 km) from Kolonides and a similar distance from Cape Akritas. Hdt. 8 . 73 . 2 locates it προgraveς τηsubiotaηtilde Καρδα µ υacuteληsubiotaη , which must mean opposite Kardamyle.The polis is usually (so Barr .) located at MME no. 512 , Bourgo Koronis (mediaeval Coron, the name having migrated hither), possibly legendary Rhion (see introduction to this chapter). Asine was sometimes identified with Homer's Antheia (Strabo 8 . 4 . 5 ).Valmin ( 1930 ) 169 suggests that Rhion is the eastern part of Cape Akritas, on the western side of the Thouriate Gulf,rather than its northeastern side.For a summary of the arguments about its location, see Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 97 -98 n. 91 (citing Roebuck ( 1941 ) 19 -22 ; contra Valmin ( 1930 ) 164 -68 , 169 , ( 1934 -35 ) 44 -46 ). The earliest find is an early Archaic Protocorinthian sherd (cf.Valmin ( 1930 ) 178 ; Hope Simpson ( 1957 ) 249 ). Cf., however, SEG 11 985 (second century ad ), a decree of Korone found at modern Koroni, which the editors in SEG suspect may cause the orthodox view to be revised, though Roebuck ( 1941 ) 19 -22 presumes that the stone was transported from the site of ancient Korone (no. 316 ) at Petalidi. See also Meyer ( 1978 ) 198 -99 . Asine is implicitly called a polis in Hdt. 8 . 73 . 2 , where polis is used in the urban and/or political sense; in Ps.-Skylax 46 , where polis is used in the urban sense,Asine (presumably the Messenian one, cf. infra ) is listed as the first toponym after the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε (though Mothone (no. 319 ), listed second, ought to have been named first). Otherwise it is called a polis only in post-Classical sources: e.g. IG iv 679 (C3l-C2e) where the polis of the Ασιναίων asks to take part in the rites of Demeter at Hermione. The internal collective use of the city-ethnic occurs in Heltic decrees (e.g. SEG 11 986 (C3 -C2 )). The external collective use occurs in Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 25 , and the external individual use in Xenophon's references to Neon of Asine ( infra ), in IG ii² 8387 a (C4 ) and in SEG 12 219 ( 322 -310 ), a grant of proxeny, theorodokia , etc. by Delphi to two citizens of Asine. Asine was peopled with the expelled population of Argolic Asine (Dryopians, cf. Hdt. 8 . 73 . 2 ) when it was destroyed (Theopomp.fr. 383 apud Strabo 8 . 6 . 11 ; Paus. 3 . 7 . 4 , 4 . 8 . 3 , 14 . 3 ; cf. 4 . 24 . 4 , 34 . 9 ) after the First Messenian War (Lazenby ( 1972 ) 85 ; Harrison and Spencer ( 1998 ) 154 ). Its territory was supposedly exempt from the general allotment of land after the conquest of Messenia (Paus. 4 . 24 . 4 ). In 425 , during the Sphakteria campaign,the Spartans sent to Asine for timber with which to make siege engines (Thuc. 4 . 13 . 1 ). Later, in the Peloponnesian War, the Spartan commander Gylippos had ships sent there (Thuc. 6 . 93 . 3 ). Neon of Asine (most likely from Messenian Asine) took a leading part in the expedition of the Ten Thousand (Xen. An . 5 . 3 . 4 , etc.; he is also called Λακωνικός , 7 . 2 . 29 (for a possible reason for the variation, see Shipley ( 1997 ) 209 )). In 369 or 368 the Arkadians attacked Asine; again, presumably Messenian Asine is meant (and it is not contradicted by τηtildeς Λακαίνης ) since there was a Spartan garrison ( φρουρά ) there; they defeated it, killing its Spartiate commander and devastating the outskirts ( proasteion ) of the city (Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 25 ). After the Spartans lost part of Messenia, the Asinaians were allowed to remain in their homeland ( καταgrave χώραν , Paus. 4 . 27 . 8 ); Asine was in fact within the part of Messenia retained by Sparta until 338 (Shipley ( 2000 ) 385 ). Hence, perhaps, it is put in Lakedaimon, not Messenia, by Ps.-Skylax 46 . After 338 / 7 it may have belonged to a Messenian koinon (cf. Lazenby ( 1972 ) 90 ). The population was presumably a mixture of Argolic Asinaians (Dryopians; cf. Hdt. 8 . 73 . 2 ) and pre-existing Messenians and/or Lakedaimonians. Asine was certainly perioikic; the use of its ethnic for its citizen Neon conforms to the rule whereby Lakedaimonian perioikoi are identified by their city-ethnics (Shipley ( 1997 ) 209 ; Hansen ( 1996 ) 185 )."
314,Aulon (Aulonites),Messenia,37.2,21.4,702,3410,"314 . Aulon (Aulonites) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 20 , long. 21 . 40 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: C. (S 20 ). The toponym is Αυλών , οasper (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 25 , 3 . 3 . 8 , 3 . 3 . 10 ; Strabo 8 . 3 . 25 , cf. 8 . 5 . 1 ; Paus. 4 . 36 . 7 ), which presumably describes the location (LSJ s.v. αυλών , 'hollow, defile, glen'). The (possible) city-ethnic is Αυλωνίτης (Xen. Hell . 3 . 3 . 8 ; Steph. Byz. 147 . 7 ). Paus. 4 . 36 . 7 places Aulon between Kyparissos (no. 317 ) and the river Neda.Valmin ( 1930 ) 107 -11 (and Barr .) locates it at MME no. 601 , Vounaki Palioneriou (cf. Roebuck ( 1941 ) 25 -26 n. 95 ; for the name Palioneri, cf. ΛΟΠ no. 3124 ), a fortified site with an area of 0 . 8 ha,and with Heltic,Roman and possibly Classical finds. Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 94 and n. 101 , however,suggests MME no. 602 , Ag. Ilias, a Classical and Heltic site of at least 3 ha with a good view over the coastal route. Aulon is called a polis only by Steph.Byz. 147 . 6 , who lists it as 'one of the 100 poleis ' , suggesting a Classical or Heltic source such as Theopompos; it is not clear whether polis is here used in the urban or the political sense. It is not certain, however, that Aulon was a polis in the Classical period. A possible comparandum is Laconian Σκιρῖται , whose name may be a sub-regional ethnic rather than a city-ethnic. Roebuck ( 1941 ) 25 -26 n. 95 (followed by Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 98 n. 101 ) takes Aulon in Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 25 (where Agis invades Elis δι ' Αυλῶνος , 'via Aulon' or 'through the aulon ') to be a district. At Hell . 3 . 3 . 10 Xenophon uses the preposition επί with the dative to locate men previously sent to Aulon ( επ ' Αυλῶνι ); this, again, may possibly suggest that the name denotes a geographical location rather than a polis , though there may also have been a polis . At 3 . 3 . 8 Xenophon says (with reference to c. 399 ) that the conspirator Kinadon was sent to Aulon to bring back 'certain of the Aulonitai' and certain helots; Roebuck (ibid.) accepts that this passage probably refers to a town. It is implicitly called an oppidum by Plin. HN 4 . 5 . 14 , who lists it first among the westward oppida of Elis. Aulon may well have been a perioikic polis during the period of Spartan rule in Messenia.Kinadon,the conspirator sent to arrest certain Aulonitai , is described by Xen. Hell . 3 . 3 . 5 as 'not of the homoioi ' (the full-citizen Spartiates), while at 3 . 3 . 11 he is reported to have said that he aspired to be 'a lesser man ( ηasperacuteττων ) than none in Lakedaimon' . He has generally been assumed to have belonged to the class of 'inferiors' ( υasperπο µ είονες ) attested only in the enumeration of his fellowplotters at Xen. Hell . 3 . 3 . 6 . As a demoted Spartiate, Kinadon could still have had authority over perioikoi . Roebuck ( 1941 ) 30 n. 13 and Spencer ( 1998 ) 176 assume that Aulon was perioikic. If perioikic, the population of Aulon may have been ethnically Messenian or Lakedaimonian, depending on whether colonists were sent by Sparta. The external collective use of the city-ethnic (if it is one) occurs at Xen. Hell . 3 . 3 . 8 . Noname is given to the territory of Aulon. Given its proposed location,it would have been lost by Sparta (no. 345 ) in 369 . It was probably bounded by the territory of Triphylia on the north. Aulon may have belonged to a Messenian koinon after 338 / 7 (cf. Lazenby ( 1972 ) 90 )."
315,Kardamyle (Skardamylites),Messenia,36.5,22.15,530,2681,"315 . Kardamyle (Skardamylites) Map 58 . Lat. 36 . 50 , long. 22 . 15 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. (S 34 ). The toponym is Καρδα µ υacuteλη , ηasper (Hom. Il . 9 . 150 = 9 . 252 ; Hdt. 8 . 73 . 2 ; Strabo 8 . 4 . 1 , etc.; Paus. 3 . 26 . 7 ). The city-ethnic may be Καρδα µ υλίτης (Hdn. iii . 2 530 . 22 ; Steph. Byz. 357 . 17 ; these could refer to Kardamyle in Chios (no. 840 ; Thuc. 8 . 24 . 3 ), but that was not a polis ). Both late authors state that the locals used the form Σκαρδα µ υλίτης . Strabo 8 . 4 . 4 locates Kardamyle 'on a deserted rock' between Leuktron and Pharai (no. 320 ), which does not mean that it had been abandoned. Paus. 3 . 26 . 7 locates it 60 stades ( 11 km) after Leuktra (overestimating by a factor of two; Valmin ( 1930 ) 199 ) and an unspecified distance before Gerenia. It is generally identified with MME no. 147 , Kastro Kardamylis (Archaic to mediaeval remains, as well as prehistoric). Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 98 n. 100 notes that early Doric columns have been found (citing ArchDelt 22 ( 1967 ) B. 1 206 ; see also ArchDelt 20 ( 1965 ) B 208 ). Kardamyle is not called a polis in Classical sources, but Hdt. 8 . 73 . 2 identifies Messenian Asine (no. 313 ), which he describes as a polis , as 'the Asine by (or opposite) the Laconian Kardamyle ( Καρδα µ υacuteληsubiotaη τηsubiotaηtilde Λακωνικηsubiotaηtilde )' , possibly implying that Kardamyle was at least as prominent a place as Asine, and so possibly a polis . It is called a polisma by Paus. 3 . 26 . 7 . Herodotos' description of Kardamyle as 'Laconian' ( Λακωνική ) implicitly places it in Lakonike, the territory of Sparta (no. 345 ). Steph. Byz. 357 . 17 , while citing Herodotos, places it in Messenia, perhaps reflecting the changed circumstances of the Roman period (though the words πόλις Μεσσηνίας are restored from the parallel passage in Eust. Il . 743 . 17 ). Kardamyle is one of Agamemnon's seven ptoliethra (Hom. Il . 9 . 150 = 9 . 292 ). It is generally thought to have been a perioikic polis during Spartan rule over Messenia (e.g. Roebuck ( 1941 ) 30 -31 n. 17 ). Though situated between two Eleutherolaconian poleis , Leuktra and Gerenia, it did not join that League when it was founded under Augustus,being instead detached from Messenia and given to Sparta (Paus. 3 . 26 . 7 ). Since the Eleutherolaconian league was largely a refoundation of the koinon of the Lakedaimonians that was set up after after the Roman take-over in 195 , Kardamyle had probably not been a member of that body either, which probably means that it ceased to be perioikic in 338 , when Philip II detached southern Messenia and the Dentheliatis from Sparta (Shipley ( 2000 ) 385 -86 )."
316,Korone (Koronaios),Messenia,36.5,21.55,549,2700,"316 . Korone (Koronaios) Map 58 . Lat. 36 . 50 , long. 21 . 55 . Size of territory: 2 or 3 . Type: C. (S 59 ). The toponym is Κορώνη , ηasper (Apollodoros apud Steph. Byz. 378 . 1 ; Strabo 8 . 4 . 5 ; Paus. 4 . 34 . 4 ) or Κορωνεία ( IG v . 1 34 = SEG 11 479 (second century ad )). Strabo 8 . 4 . 5 cites the view that it was Homer's Pedasos; Paus. 4 . 34 . 5 states that its original name was Aipeia.The city-ethnic is Κορωναῖος but occurs first on C2m coins of the Achaian Confederacy inscribed Αχαιῶν Κορωναίων (Head, HN ² 433 ); cf. SEG 11 985 (second century ad ), a decree of the polis . On Korone's location, see Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 97 -98 n. 91 ; Roebuck ( 1941 ) 19 -22 ; Valmin ( 1930 ) 171 -80 , ( 1934 -35 ) 44 -46 ; Meyer ( 1978 ) 195 -96 . Korone is called a polis only by late sources such as Strabo 8 . 4 . 5 , Paus. 4 . 34 . 4 , SEG 11 985 (second century ad ), and Steph. Byz. 378 . 1 . However, if Korone is correctly identified with MME no. 502 , Petalidhi (rather than mediaeval Coron, modern Koroni, which is identified with ancient Asine), the archaeological evidence suggests the possibility that it was a Classical polis . The main evidence is the supposed date of the substantial city walls, which Valmin ( 1930 ) 178 regards as including renovations from Epameinondas'time. At 4 . 34 . 5 , Pausanias says that it was originally called Aipeia, but was renamed Koroneia by its Theban oecist, Epimelides (for whom there was a hero shrine at Korone, 4 . 34 . 6 ), after the liberation of Messenia; the name was shortened to Korone by the Messenians ( Κορώνεια is actually found in inscriptions of Roman date from Sparta ( supra )). This suggests a re foundation c. 369 ; however, Lazenby ( 1972 ) 89 and Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 99 n. 125 suggest that Korone (and Kolonides) were founded in the aftermath of 369 to isolate perioikic Asine (no. 313 ) and Mothone (no. 319 ). Under Spartan rule, the surrounding area was one of the most densely settled in Messenia (Harrison and Spencer ( 1998 ) 159 ). The important Classical sanctuary of Apollo Korythos (Paus. 4 . 34 . 7 ) probably lay in Korone's territory. Votives there include SEG 42 342 , 40 362 + ( c. 460 ?), a bronze spear-butt dedicated by the Messenians, possibly celebrating a victory over the Spartans during the revolt of the 460 s (cf. Bauslaugh ( 1990 ); LSAG Messenia no. 3 ( c. C5e?)). Other early votives include SEG 11 993 ( c. 500 ). Full refs. in Meyer ( 1978 ) 196 -97 . Paus. 4 . 34 . 4 locates Korone 20 stades ( 3 . 7 km) from an inland spring, Plataniston, which supplied the town. At 4 . 34 . 6 he notes temples of Artemis Paidotrophos, Dionysos and Asklepios, as well as a hero shrine to Epimelides."
317,Kyparissos (Kyparissieus),Messenia,37.15,21.4,536,2566,"317 . Kyparissos (Kyparissieus) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 15 , long. 21 . 40 . Size of territory: 3 or 4 . Type: [A]. (S 35 ). The toponym is Κυπάρισσος , ηasper , in Ps.-Skylax 45 (cf. Plin. HN 4 . 5 . 15 ); elsewhere it is Κυπαρισσία , ηasper (Strabo 8 . 3 . 22 ; Κυπαρισ ( σ ) ῖνα in MSS; cf. 8 . 3 . 25 ; Steph. Byz. 395 . 1 ) or Κυπαρισσιαί (Paus. 4 . 36 . 7 ). The city-ethnic is Κυπαρισσιευacuteς ( IG v . 1 1421 (C4 -C3 ); Head, HN ² 433 ) or Κυπαρισσευacuteς (Polyb. 5 . 92 . 5 ; SEG 11 1021 (C2 -C1 ); Strabo 8 . 3 . 22 ). The polis is plausibly located at MME no. 70 (Kyparissia), a site with Classical walls, Heltic and Roman buildings; a settlement of 1 ha or more (modern Kyparissia is also called Arkadia, ΛΟΠ no. 2000 ). For the walls, see Valmin ( 1930 ) 129 -31 (parts are C5 or later; some black-figured pottery); Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 99 n. 123 (where '# 72 'should read '# 70 ') cites Valmin ( 1930 ) 131 -32 on the extent of the fortifications. Full references in Meyer ( 1978 ) 204 -5 . In Ps.-Skylax 45 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Kyparissos may be the first toponym listed after the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε . It seems also to be implicitly described as a polis in the urban sense in Diod. 15 . 77 . 4 (r 365 / 4 ). In the political sense, polis is not attested until the Roman era ( SEG 11 1025 (C2 -C1 ); πόλει is a near-certain restoration). However, the decree IG v . 1 1421 (C4 -C3 ) demonstrates that it was a polis in the political sense long before that date: it uses the internal collective city-ethnic ( 1 -2 ), attests to the existence of a territory ruled by the Kyparissians ( ε [ ί ] τίς κα εσάγηsubiotaη εις ταgraveν χώραν τῶν Κυπαρισσιέων . . . , 1 -2 ), and names a board of officials called οιasper πεντηκοστολόγοι ( 9 ), a name that suggests the raising of customs dues. Moreover, IG v . 2 390 (C4l-C3e) is a grant of proxeny and theorodokia by Arkadian Lousoi (no. 279 ) to two citizens of Kyparissos (cf. Perlman ( 2000 ) 241 -42 ); and Polyb. 5 . 92 . 5 attests that in 217 the people were able to mobilise military forces. The internal collective use of the city-ethnic occurs in IG v . 1 1421 (C4 -C3 ); the external collective use is attested at Polyb. 5 . 92 . 5 , and the external individual use in IG v . 2 390 (C4l-C3e). In 365 / 4 , when Kyparissos was captured by Arkadian forces, it was evidently a defended settlement (Diod. 15 . 77 . 4 ) and thus quite probably perioikic; alternatively, it became a polis only after this time; cf. Roebuck ( 1941 ) 30 n. 12 ; Harrison and Spencer ( 1998 ) 156 ."
318,Messene (Messenios) /Ithome (Ithomaios),Messenia,37.1,21.55,3079,15103,"318 . Messene (Messenios) /Ithome (Ithomaios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 10 , long. 21 . 55 . Size of territory: 4 or 5 . Type: A. (S 11 ). The name of the polis founded in 369 is regularly Μεσσήνη , ηasper (Dem. 16 . 25 ; Lycurg. 1 . 62 ), to which corresponds the cityethnic Μεσσάνιος ( CID ii 4 . i . 28 ( 360 )), but it is also called ' Ιθώ µ η , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 45 ; F.Delphes iii . 46 ( 326 or 316 ); Diod. 19 . 54 . 4 (r 316 )), to which the corresponding city-ethnic was probably ' Ιθω µ αῖος , abbreviated as ΙΘΩΜ on C4s coins (Head, HN ² 432 ). Μεσσήνη , as is normal in earlier literature ( supra 550 ), could still denote the region (e.g.Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 3 ; see Meyer ( 1978 ) 159 -60 , 283 ). The two names are combined at Ps.-Skylax 45 : έθνος Μεσσήνη (the regional name) καιgrave πόλεις εν αυτηsubiotaηtilde αιasperacuteδε · . . . ' Ιθώ µ η εν µ εσογείΩsubiotaα κτλ . (the name of the polis ). Roebuck ( 1941 ) 37 and Lazenby ( 1972 ) 89 note that until at least the end of C4 the polis was apparently called Ithome; thereafter Messene was the usual name (cf. KlPauly ii. 1488 ). In CID ii 4 . i . 14 -15 and 28 ( 360 ), where polis is used in the political sense, Messene is one of the polities listed (as Μεσσάνιοι ) after the heading τάδε πόλεις καιgrave ιδιῶται επάρ [ ξαν ] το ; the political sense is found also at Isoc. 6 . 87 . In the urban sense, polis is found in Dem. 16 . 25 . The earliest literary mention of Messene as an existing polis is in Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 27 ; here he does not explicitly call it a polis ; however, later he mentions the recognition of its autonomia ( 7 . 1 . 36 : αυτόνο µ ον εῖναι αποgrave Λακεδαι µ ονίων ), which suggests that he did consider it a polis . The usual city-ethnic, Μεσσάνιος , is of course attested before the foundation of the polis , for it was also the regional ethnic of the Messenians (e.g. IG i³ 1355 ( 475 -450 ); ML 74 ( c. 421 ); Thuc. 4 . 9 . 1 ; see Figueira ( 1999 ) and Luraghi ( 2002 ) for the development of Messenian identity). After 369 , the internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested by coins inscribed ΜΕΣΣΑΝΙΩΝ ( infra ) and in IG v . 1 1425 . 10 (C4l-C3e); the external collective use is found e.g. in SEG 29 405 . 10 ( 365 / 4 ), CID ii 4 . i . 28 ( 360 ), IG ii² 225 . 6 ( 343 / 2 ) and in Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 27 , 7 . 5 . 5 . The external individual use is found in F.Delphes iii . 4 4 ( 340 ), IG ii² 9347 (C4m), IG iv² . 1 122 . 129 (C4 ) and IvO 172 ( 360 -300 ). We cannot, however, always determine whether the ethnic functions as a city-ethnic and thus refers to citizens of the polis of Messene specifically, or as a regional ethnic and thus to members of the wider community ( ethnos ) of Messenians. A particularly ambiguous instance is found in Syll . ³ 224 ( c. 345 ), a response by the Amphictyonic League to a request by the Μεγαλοπολῖται and the Μεσσήνιοι for membership of the League: the fact that Μεσσήνιοι occurs alongside Μεγαλοπολῖται suggests that it is here a city-ethnic, whereas the request to become an Amphictyonic member suggests that it may be the regional ethnic, since the League was organised on the basis of ethne (Lefèvre ( 1998 ) 17 -20 ). When it functions as the regional ethnic, it is sometimes amplified by the addition of a phrase denoting a local community of Messenia, e.g. Μεσσάνιος εκ Θουρίας ( BCH 6 ( 1882 ) 221 no. 53 = F.Delphes iii . 4 5 ( 315 -280 )) and Μεσσάνιος εξ ' Ιθώ µ ης ( BCH 6 ( 1882 ) 221 no. 52 = F.Delphes iii . 4 6 (post-327 / 6 )); cf. ΜΕΣΣΑΝΙΩΝ ΙΘΩΜ [ ΑΙΩΝ ] on coins of c. 330 -280 (Head, HN ² 431 -32 ). This plurality of usage may reflect the fact that a federal structure was probably introduced after 369 , no doubt under Theban influence, in which the new polis played the leading role. The koinon is attested in I.Magnesia 43 ( 207 / 6 ): τοgrave κοινοgraveν τῶν Μεσσηνίων (cf. Lazenby ( 1972 ) 90 ; Meyer ( 1978 ) 283 , arguing for isopolity rather than sympolity; see Polyb. 23 . 17 . 2 on Abia, Thouria and Pharai; also McDonald and Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 145 ; Davis ( 1998 a ) p. xxx). In that case the symmachia treaty of the Arkadian Confederacy with the Messenians ( SEG 22 339 , Olympia ( 365 / 4 )) may have been concluded with a Messenian koinon rather than with the polis of Messene alone, as may the treaty of symmachia with Athens (no. 361 ) et al . attested in IG ii² 225 ( 343 / 2 ). The city of Messene was no doubt meant to be dominant,not least for the sake of the stability and security of the region. To that extent the other poleis of post-liberation Messenia can be regarded as dependent poleis , but there seems to have been considerable polis autonomy: see Kyparissos (no. 317 ) for a decree on customs and proxeny relations of that polis in C4 -C3 ; note also that Mothone (no. 319 ) minted its own coins c. C3 (Head, HN ² 433 ). Even c. 240 the polis of Messene made its own treaty of isopolity with Phigaleia (no. 292 ) ( IG v . 2 419 = Syll . ³ 472 ; Meyer ( 1978 ) 283 ). These indications may hold good for C4 also; strong central control by Messene was perhaps a development of C3s or even C3l rather than C4 . It was perhaps during C3 that Messenia came to replace Messene as the usual name of the region (Meyer ( 1978 ) 284 ). The federal arrangement appears to have ended in 182 , when Messene was required to rejoin the Achaian Confederacy separately from the three poleis to its south-east-Abia, Thouria (no. 322 ) and Pharai (no. 320 ), which joined the league individually (Polyb. 23 . 17 . 2 ). Cf. also under Mothone infra , with reference to 191 . Messene was founded after the first Boiotian invasion of Laconia by Epameinondas and his allies in 370 / 69 (Roebuck ( 1941 ) 27 -39 ). Although Epiteles of Argos was put in charge of building the polis (Paus. 4 . 26 . 7 ), Epameinondas was evidently regarded as the oecist,since statues were erected to him (Paus. 4 . 31 . 10 , 32 . 1 ); he was revered as such in the second century ad (Paus. 9 . 14 . 5 , 15 . 6 ). For an account of how he organised the construction of Messene and other polismata , see Paus. 4 . 27 . 5 -7 (cf. Roebuck ( 1941 ) 31 -32 n. 21 ). Philip II was honoured as second oecist for his benefactions after Chaironeia (Strabo 8 . 4 . 8 ). The inhabitants of the new polis included former helots (Isoc. 6 . 28 ; cf. Roebuck ( 1941 ) 34 ), expatriated Messenians, and 'others who so wished'(Diod. 15 . 66 . 1 ; cf. Lycurg. 1 . 62 : Μεσσήνην . . . εκ τῶν τυχόντων ανθρώπων συνοικισθεῖσαν ). The territory of the new polis probably embraced the upper Messenian plain and the western part of the lower one, marching with those of Korone (no. 316 ) to the south, Pylos to the south-west (if it was a polis ), and Kyparissos (no. 317 ) to the west and north-west (Meyer ( 1978 ) 150 ); probably also with that of Thouria (no. 322 ) to the east; and with those of the Arkadian poleis to the north-unless Dorion and Andania to the north, and Ampheia to the north-east, were poleis . For a possible network of Late Classical/Early Heltic forts in the chora , see Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 94 with 98 -99 nn. 117 -20 ; Roebuck ( 1941 ) 39 -40 n. 68 , 59 -60 , 64 -65 , 122 -24 ; Valmin ( 1930 ) 67 -73 , 78 -82 , 90 , 92 -93 . SEG 34 321 lists graffiti from a fort at Vasiliko near Messene, probably dating to C5m and later. C4 treaties concluded by Messene include one with Pisa (no. 262 ) and Sikyon (no. 228 ) (Ringel et al . ( 1999 ) 417 -20 ), and at least two with Athens (no. 361 ) ( Staatsverträge 337 and 343 (on which see, however, Roebuck ( 1941 ) 52 n. 113 ); Dem. 16 . 9 with Roebuck ( 1941 ) 47 ); though not explicitly attested, alliances with Boiotia/Thebes (no. 221 ) (cf. Xen. Hell . 7 . 5 . 4 -5 ), Arkadia and Argos (no. 347 ) may be assumed to have been concluded immediately after the foundation (Roebuck ( 1941 ) 40 -41 ). Messenian troops fought on the anti-Spartan side in the battle of Mantinea in 362 (Diod. 15 . 85 . 2 ). Messene was a party to the koine eirene concluded after the battle (Diod. 15 . 89 . 1 ; Ryder ( 1965 ) 84 -85 , 140 -44 ) and thus gained international recognition of its existence (Roebuck ( 1941 ) 47 ). An alliance with Megalopolis (no. 282 ) is attested by Diod. 16 . 39 . 2 -3 (r 352 / 1 ) and one with Philip II was concluded c. 344 (Roebuck ( 1941 ) 49 ). Messene also became a member of the Corinthian League ([Dem.] 17 . 4 ; Roebuck ( 1941 ) 55 n. 120 ); see, however, supra for the possibility that the contracting party in such cases was the ethnos of the Messenians and not the polis of Messene. Exiles restored by Alexander the Great are attested in [Dem.] 17 . 4 . IG v . 1 1425 (C4l-C3e) is a grant of proxeny by Messene to a citizen of Zakynthos (no. 141 ); citizens of Messene were granted proxeny by Delphi (no. 177 ) in 340 ( F.Delphes iii . 4 4 ) and 326 -316 ( F.Delphes iii . 4 6 ). Grants of proxeny and theorodokia by Argos (no. 347 ) to citizens of Messene are listed in SEG 13 243 (post-315 ). A C4l-C3e decree ( IG v . 1 1425 . 2 ) attests to the existence of a phyle named ∆αϊφοντίς , and it seems probable that a system of five phylai was created at the foundation in 369 (Jones, POAG 146 -48 ). The existence of a calendar is attested by IG v . 1 1425 (C4l-C3 ), where a month is referred to by number: δυωδ ( εκάτω ) ε ´. Although Meyer ( 1978 ) 151 supposes the city's original constitution to have been 'oligarchic-timocratic' , decrees of the polis demonstrate the existence of democratic institutions. IG v . 1 1426 (C4l-C3e) is a decree for citizens of another polis (cf. under Ampheia in the introduction, supra ) who receive ισ [ οπολιτείαν ] and [ γαtildeς τε καιgrave οικίας έγκτ ] ασιν ( SEG 11 1029 , 41 321 ). IG v . 1 1425 is a possibly C4 -C3 proxeny decree of the damos ( έδοξε τῶι δά µ ωι ) for a citizen of Zakynthos (no. 141 ) (though it is downdated to C2 -C1 by Roebuck at SEG 11 1030 ). IG v . 1 1435 ( = SEG 11 1037 ) is a C4 -C3list of names. In SEG 43 135 = 41 320 ( 317 ), the Messenians made a treaty with Polyperchon and his son Alexandros for the installation of a garrison on Mt. Ithome; the text mentions the damos , presumably of Messene. SEG 45 290 = 41 322 (C3e), an alliance of Messene with Lysimachos, probably dates from immediately before 295 / 4 (Matthaiou ( 1990 -91 )) and mentions ephors of the city (line 23 ; cf. Polyb. 4 . 4 . 2 -3 , 4 . 31 . 2 ). IG v . 1 1471 (C4 ), from the Artemis Limnatis sanctuary, suggests that a priest, presumably that of Zeus Ithomatas, was the annual eponym of the city. Arist. Rh . 1418 b 11 refers to the Μεσσηνιακηgrave εκκλησία , presumably the assembly of the polis (or the Messenian Federation?). The site is located below Mt. Ithome by Paus. 4 . 31 . 4 , at a distance of c. 40 stades ( 7 . 3 km) from the sources of the river Pamisos ( 4 . 31 . 4 ) and c. 80 stades ( 15 km) from its mouth ( 4 . 34 . 1 ). It is MME no. 529 , Mavrommati (Geometric to Roman,including a Geometric figurine),where excavations have been carried out for the Archaeological Society of Athens, latterly by Themelis (see e.g. AR 47 ( 2000 -1 ) 48 -49 ; references prior to 1973 collected by Meyer ( 1978 ) 137 ). The site is at a considerable elevation ( 350 -400 m above sea level: ibid. 139 ), in a hollow between three hills. Diod. 15 . 67 . 1 appears to say that the city was built in 85 days, though this can hardly have extended beyond a fort capable of housing the Theban garrison. The completed walls are among the finest (cf. Paus. 4 . 31 . 5 ) and best preserved in Greece. They cannot be shown to postdate C4 , and should predate Cassander's unsuccessful siege of 316 -315 (Diod. 19 . 54 . 4 , 64 . 1 ; Meyer ( 1978 ) 140 -41 , 142 ). They are c. 8 km long and enclose c. 290 ha (Meyer ( 1978 ) 138 ), not all of which was built up. The 'Arkadian gate' in the north wall is the best-known city gate surviving from ancient Greece (photograph of part of the wall and a tower: MME pl. 9 . 3 ). Mt. Ithome,above the town, has polygonal fortifications probably dating from the helot revolt of the 460 s (Meyer ( 1978 ) 149 ). An unpublished C4 inscription ( SEG 45 297 ) contains financial accounts of the construction and repair of public and cult buildings. Stamped roof-tiles with fragmentary legends have been found in the C4l construction fill of the sanctuary of Demeter (see SEG 45 333 -34 ). The city exhibits a Hippodamian plan.Some C4 buildings have been excavated (e.g. a two-storey hall with Ionic interior colonnade, dated C4s: Orlandos, Ergon ( 1957 ) 147 -48 ). Most buildings and sculptures, however, notably the Asklepieion complex, are Heltic or Roman; see e.g. Themelis ( 1994 a ) on the sculptor Damophon (also Alcock ( 1998 ) 183 , 186 -87 ). The important Messenian cult of Zeus Ithomatas,depicted on the city's first coins ( infra ), was based at Messene (Paus. 4 . 33 . 2 ). Other cults from the generations after its foundation include Artemis Limnatis ( IG v . 1 1442 (C3 -C2 ); temple excavated: Le Bas ( 1844 -45 ); Meyer ( 1978 ) 149 ); Artemis Ortheia (Themelis ( 1994 b )); Athena Kyparissia, with cult officials ( SEG 23 209 -10 (C3 )); Asklepios and Hygieia (e.g. SEG 38 339 ( c. 220 ?), 45 301 (C2 )); Acheloös ( SEG 41 360 + (early Heltic)); the Dioskouroi ( SEG 45 302 ( c. 300 )); Eilethyia ( SEG 41 359 (C4 -C3 ), 45 303 (C3 )); Herakles ( SEG 41 362 (C3 )); Hermes ( SEG 41 361 (C3 -C2 )); and Poseidon ( SEG 45 305 (seemingly Late Classical/Early Heltic)). See also Jost ( 1996 ). On hero cults, see Themelis ( 2000 ). Note also SEG 45 324 (C4 ?), a musical notation (cf. SEG 43 164 , 44382 ) in Doric mode,found in the Hierothysion and presumably originating from a cult. The temple of Pamisos at MME no. 530 , Ag. Phloros (ACHR), excavated by Valmin ( 1938 ), may have lain in the territory of Messene. An Archaic stele was dedicated to the river Pamisos: LSAG 206 no. 1 (' c . 550 ?'; now C6 or later, LSAG ² 448 no.A; Richter ( 1949 ) 89 -90 ). As early as 368 , Damiskos of Messene (whose later career included Nemean and Isthmian victories) won the boys' stadion at Olympia ( Olympionikai 417 ); the victory of Damaretos of Messene in boys' boxing is placed c. 344 by Moretti ( Olympionikai 448 ), and that of Telestas, also in boys' boxing, in 340 ( Olympionikai 453 ). Messene initiated minting in both silver and bronze shortly after the foundation. Silver of 369 -330 (staters, triobols, obols, hemiobols on the Aiginetan standard): obv . head of Demeter; rev . Zeus Ithomatas striding and wielding thunderbolt and holding eagle, or tripod. Legends: ΜΕΣ , ΜΕΣΣΑΝΙΩΝ . Bronze of 369 -330 : obv . head of Demeter; rev .

319,Mothone (Mothonaios),Messenia,36.5,21.4,656,3177,"319 . Mothone (Mothonaios) Map 58 . Lat. 36 . 50 , long. 21 . 40 . Size of territory: 2 or 3 . Type: A. (S 36 ). The toponym is given as Μεθώνη , ηasper , by Thuc. 2 . 25 . 1 (cf. Plin. HN 4 . 51 . 5 ; Strabo 8 . 4 . 3 ; Steph. Byz. 440 -41 ); but as Μοθώνη in Ps.Skylax 46 (also Paus. 4 . 3 . 10 ). That the latter is correct for the Classical and at least the early Heltic period is suggested by C3 coins with the legend ΜΟ (Head, HN ² 433 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 3 no. 1035 ; SNG Cop. Phliasia-Laconia 537 ). The former spelling was perhaps an assimilation to Methone (no. 541 ) in Makedonia, just as Methana (no. 352 ) in the Argolid was sometimes misspelled Methone in some MSS of Thucydides (as noted by Strabo 8 . 6 . 15 = Theopomp. fr. 384 ). The city-ethnic is Μοθωναῖος in Paus. 4 . 18 . 1 and on third century ad coins (Head, HN ² 433 ). Mothone is called a polis in the urban sense by Thuc. 2 . 25 . 2 ; at Ps.-Skylax 46 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Mothone is the second (or first) toponym listed after the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε . Mothone is located in Lakonike by Thuc. 2 . 25 . 1 (cf. Diod. 11 . 84 . 6 (r 454 )), and in Lakedaimon by Ps.-Skylax 46 . Mothone's territory ( ηasper Μοθωναία , Paus. 4 . 35 . 6 ) would have been bounded by those of Asine (no. 313 ) to the east, Pylos to the north, and possibly Korone (no. 316 ) to the north-east and Kolonides (if,as Lazenby and Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) suggest, it was founded post-369 to isolate Asine and Mothone). Mothone is assumed to have been perioikic by Harrison and Spencer ( 1998 ) 156 ; this seems certain, since the Athenians twice thought it worth attacking. It remained perioikic after 369 , being listed under Lakedaimon by Ps.-Skylax 46 . It was probably dependent upon Messene after 338 , perhaps as a member of a Messenian Federation (see under Messene, supra ). The city is securely located at MME no. 412 , Methoni (Archaic to mediaeval pottery, graves, architectural fragments), mediaeval Modon with its Venetian fortress. Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 98 n. 96 notes evidence of late Archaic habitation, citing ArchDelt 21 ( 1966 ) B. 1 164 ; at p. 99 n. 121 , however, it is stated that the precise date of ( sc . other) remains at Methoni is uncertain. Full references in Meyer ( 1978 ) 200 -1 . Valmin ( 1930 ) 152 -54 notes a Classical or Heltic cemetery c. 1 . 5 km to the north. In 454 , it was taken by Tolmides (Diod. 11 . 84 . 6 ); in 431 it was fortified, but weak and unmanned (Thuc. 2 . 25 . 1 ; cf. HCT ad loc .; cf. also Diod. 12 . 43 . 2 -3 , which mentions an unsuccessful Athenian siege). The walls and harbour mole were incorporated into the spectacular Venetian fortifications (Meyer ( 1978 ) 200 ). Pausanias gives Mothone a legendary origin, its harbour having been built by King Dotadas ( 4 . 3 . 10 ), and its name before the Trojan War having been Pedasos (see Hom. Il . 9 . 152 = 9 . 294 and supra 549 , 553 -54 ). The same is asserted by Strabo 8 . 4 . 3 , who notes that some people locate Homer's Aipeia here. More plausibly, at 4 . 24 . 4 Pausanias says that Mothone was founded by exiles from Nauplia,who were not expelled after Leuktra ( 4 . 37 . 8 )."
320,Pharai (Pharaiates),Messenia,37.0,22.1,589,2791,"320 . Pharai (Pharaiates) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 00 , long. 22 . 10 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: C. (S 79 ). The toponym is Φαραί , αιasper , in Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 7 , Polyb. 16 . 16 . 3 , Paus. 4 . 16 . 8 ; Φηραί is found in Strabo 8 . 4 . 4 and Steph. Byz. 658 . 4 (cf. Pherae at Nep. Conon 1 . 1 ); Ptol. Geog . 3 . 14 . 31 has Φεραί . The city-ethnic was Φαραιάτης , according to Strabo 8 . 7 . 5 , who explicitly distinguishes it from the ethnic of Achaian Pharai (no. 241 ); cf. Paus. 4 . 30 . 3 ; Φαραιdieresisacuteτης is found in Steph. Byz. 658 . 5 . Pharai was clearly a polis by 182 , when it joined the Achaian Confederacy separately from Messene (Polyb. 23 . 17 . 2 ); but earlier references are vague about its status.Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 7 refers to it as a chora , but not in such a way as to exclude a polis , and it was clearly already a settlement. Archaeological evidence suggests that it was a significant settlement from early times, and a fortified polis at least post-369 . It is plausibly located at modern Kalamata (officially Kalamai), specifically MME no. 142 , Kastro Kalamatas (LH iii , Geometric to mediaeval; extent not stated; Heltic foundations, C4 (?) city walls, Archaic to Roman funerary reliefs). The Classical fortifications appear to have occupied a much smaller area than those of the Heltic period (Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 99 n. 124 ). See Meyer ( 1978 ) 181 for full bibliography. Ancient authors identified it with Pharai or Phere ( Φήρη , ηasper ), home of Diokles (a descendant of the river Alpheios: Hom. Il . 5 . 543 , Od . 3 . 488 = 15 . 186 ) and one of Agamemnon's seven ptoliethra ( Il . 9 . 151 = 9 . 293 ; cf. 2 . 743 ). In Pausanias, it has a legendary oecist ( 4 . 30 . 2 ) and is described as having been a polis during the Second Messenian War ( 4 . 16 . 8 ). To the west, the temple of Poseidon at Akovitika will have lain within the territory of Pharai; finds there include C6 and C5 votives to Pohoidan ( SEG 25 431 ), tiles with δα µ όσιος stamps ( SEG 25 432 (C6 -C5 )), and the earliest Messenian text, a C6m(?) relief pithos dedicated to Poseidon ( LSAG ² addenda,p. 448 no. 1 a; Themelis ( 1969 ) fig. 4 , ( 1970 ) figs 1 -2 , pl. 37 ). Cultic rock-cut inscriptions, seemingly Late Archaic or Early Classical, are found about an hour away ( c . 6 km?)and include votives to Kore,Pan and the Tityroi(?) (see IG v . 1 , addenda): IG v . 1 1362 a-g; cf. SEG 11 969 ( LSAG 206 no. 5 ( c. C5e?)). Paus. 4 . 31 . 1 mentions the grove of Apollo Karneios; if correctly identified with MME no. 540 , 1 km east of Ag. Pantes near Kalamata, this should date back to Geometric and Archaic times. After 369 , Pharai may, like Mothone (no. 319 ), have been dependent on Messene within a loose federal structure (cf. Lazenby ( 1972 ) 90 )."
321,Thalamai (Thalamates),Messenia,36.45,22.2,311,1479,"321 . Thalamai (Thalamates) Map 58 . Lat. 36 . 45 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. (S 33 ); LS ii. 299 -300 ll150 . The toponym is Θαλά µ αι , αιasper (Theopomp. fr. 172 apud Steph. Byz. 306 . 1 ; Polyb. 16 . 16 . 3 ). The city-ethnic is Θαλα µ άτης ( IG v . 1 1312 = SEG 11 945 (Hell.); Paus. 3 . 21 . 7 ). NoArchaic or Classical source calls Thalamai a polis , but archaeological evidence suggests that it was a settlement and thus possibly a polis . Its location is very probably MME no. 150 , Svina Koutiphariou (now Platanos Thalamon, ΛΟΠ no. 3427 ; for modern Thalamai see ΛΟΠ no. 1222 ), where there are Classical walls and a Heltic well-house, and where Archaic to Roman finds have been made, including a C7 (?) terracotta statuette (cf. LS ii. 299 -300 , ll150 ; Levi ( 1971 ) ii. 96 n. 271 ; Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 98 n. 100 ; Dickins ( 1904 -5 ); Valmin ( 1930 ) 204 -5 ). Theopomp. fr. 172 apud Steph. Byz. 306 . 1 assigns Thalamai to Messenia; Pausanias implicitly places it in Lakonike, since he includes it in book 3 , but attributes it to Messenia in connection with the legend of Tyndareos ( 3 . 1 . 4 ) and says that the Messenians claim that the district containing Pephnos (only 4 km away) was once theirs ( 3 . 26 . 3 ). Wide ( 1893 ) 313 collects references to the famous cult of the Dioskouroi at Thalamai. IG v . 1 1316 , a C5e votive stele to Apollo Kabatas, is probably from Thalamai; IG v . 1 1317 is a C4 -C3 votive statue to Pasiphae."
322,Thouria (Thouriates),Messenia,37.05,21.0,808,3863,"322 . Thouria (Thouriates) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 05 , long. 21 . 00 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: B. (S 21 ). The toponym is Θουρία , ηasper (Polyb. 23 . 17 . 2 ; restored in IG v . 1 1387 . 4 (C3 )); Θευρία , ηasper is found in IG v . 1 213 . 19 ( = SEG 38 333 + ; now dated post-403 , LSAG ² 201 no. 52 , addenda p. 448 ). Ptol. Geog . 3 . 14 . 43 has Θουacuteριον . Strabo 8 . 4 . 5 says that it is Homeric Aipeia (Hom. Il . 9 . 152 = 9 . 294 ) but notes that others locate Antheia ( 9 . 151 , 293 ) here. Paus. 4 . 31 . 1 opts for the latter identification. The city-ethnic is Θουριάτης (Thuc. 1 . 101 . 2 ; SEG 11 972 + (C2m); Paus. 4 . 31 . 1 ) and Θουριευacuteς ( IvO 46 (C2m)). Θου [ ριέ ]| ων is restored in SEG 11 974 (C1 ), though Θου [ ριατ ]| ῶν seems equally possible. Androtion apud Steph. Byz. 320 . 22 , s.v. Θυρέα , where the ethnic is unexpectedly Θουacuteριος , may be a garbled C4 reference to this polis and may preserve a further variant of the name. Thouria would have been detached from Sparta either in 338 or, perhaps more likely, in 369 , and under the probably federal arrangements that followed the foundation of Messene ( supra ) we find the phrase Μεσσάνιος εκ Θουρίας applied to a citizen of the polis ( BCH 6 ( 1882 ) 221 no. 53 = F.Delphes iii . 4 5 ( 315 -280 )). The feminine Θουρία ( IG ii² 8895 (C4m)) may refer to this or another, similarly named polis . Thouria was the only perioikic polity apart from Aithaia (no. 312 ) to revolt in 465 (Thuc. 1 . 101 . 2 ). It is not explicitly called a polis , however,before IvO 46 (a C2m boundary adjudication with Megalopolis (no. 282 )), where it is called polis in the political sense. But it was probably a polis long before: Thuc. 1 . 101 . 2 uses the external collective city-ethnic, and if it refers to the present city, IG ii² 8895 (C4m) attests the external individual use. Finally, a citizen of Thouria was granted proxeny at Delphi (no. 177 ) c. 316 ( BCH 6 ( 1882 ), 221 no. 53 ; F.Delphes iii . 4 5 ). The site of Thouria is probably MME no. 137 , Ellinika Aithaias, not far north of modern Thouria (Aithaia is the former Delimimi, ΛΟΠ no. 304 ; the latter was formerly Phroutzalokamara, ΛΟΠ no. 1237 ). From Ellinika come Bronze Age and Protogeometric to Roman finds;the extent of the historical site is not stated in the literature (cf. McDonald and Rapp ( 1972 ) 243 ). See Lazenby ( 1972 ) 86 and Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 98 n. 94 for more details; Valmin ( 1930 ) 51 , 56 -61 ; Meyer in KlPauly v. 801 -2 , s.v. Thuria; Meyer ( 1978 ) 182 . The late Classical or Heltic fortifications at Ellinika are C4l-C3e (Hope Simpson ( 1972 ) 98 n. 111 , ( 1966 ) 123 -24 ; illustrated, MME pl. 9 . 4 ). Paus. 4 . 31 . 2 says that the city was formerly on higher ground, where he saw ruined walls and a sanctuary of the Syrian goddess; while the sanctuary would have been Heltic, the walls may have been Classical. Paus. 4 . 31 . 1 includes Thouria in his account of Messenia. Strabo 8 . 4 . 4 implies that it is a polis with a territory. It was probably detached from Sparta (no. 345 ) in 338 / 7 rather than 369 , since Sparta seems to have retained the land around the head of the Messenian (or Thouriate) Gulf (Shipley ( 2000 ) 385 ). In the early Heltic period, Stephanus Comicus, Philolakon , fr. 1 apud Athen. 469 a-b ( κώ µ η µ εgraveν ουtildeν τίς εστι περιgrave τηgraveν Θουρίαν ) implies that at least one subordinate centre existed in this district in the time of King Pyrrhos. Various public institutions and officials are named in inscriptions, but only in the Heltic period: e.g. IG v . 1 1379 (C2 -C1 ), 1380 (C2 ), 1384 (C2l), 1386 ( c. C2 ), 1388 (undated). They imply a democratic constitution at that time, which may have existed since 369 or 338 . In c. C4e a festival of Poseidon, the Πο h οίδια , was held at Thouria ( IG v . 1 213 ). ## II. The Poleis"
323,Aigys (Aigyeus),Lakedaimon,37.15,22.1,581,2882,"323 . Aigys (Aigyeus) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 15 , long. 22 . 10 . Size of territory: 1 ? Type: C. (S 12 ). The toponym is Αῖγυς , ηasper , not used before Ephor. fr. 117 apud Strabo 8 . 5 . 4 (dat. Αίγυι ; Αίτυι codd.); Steph. Byz. 45 . 1 . The ethnic attested in Classical times is Αιγυευacuteς (Theopomp. fr. 361 apud Steph. Byz. 45 . 6 -7 ); in post-C4sources Αιγυacuteτης (e.g. Paus. 3 . 2 . 5 ). It is possible that Ephor. fr. 117 regards Aigys as a polis in the political and urban senses; however, he refers to legendary times, and the passage is not conclusive evidence that Aigys was a polis in Ephoros' day. Paus. 3 . 2 . 5 (rC8e) gives an anachronistic version of history in which Aigys, already a perioikic polis , was enslaved by the Lakedaimonians under Archelaos ( c. 775 -c. 760 ). The (external) collective use of the ethnic Aigyeis occurs only in Theopomp. fr. 361 apud Steph. Byz. 45 . 6 -7 ( Αιγυέας αυτουacuteς φησιν ), but we do not know whether he used it as a 'sub-regional' ethnic or as a city-ethnic. ²⁸ References to komai are assembled by Shipley ( 1997 ) 261 -63 . The only preHeltic reference to a kome is Xenophon's description of S 16 , Oion ( Hell . 6 . 5 . 25 ). The inhabitants of S 101 , Tyros, described their town as a kome in 275 . Two settlements are described as komai in Heltic sources: S 22 , Belbina (C1 papyrus, perhaps quoting Phylarchos) and S 65 , Helos (Strabo). Pausanias adds the rest: S 1 , Anthana; S 30 , Eua; S 96 , Glyppia; S 97 , Krokeai; S 98 , Neris; S 99 , Pleiai/Palaia; and S 100 , Selinous. ²⁹ On local settlement hierarchies, see Shipley ( 1992 ). If Aigys existed as a named settlement from late Classical to Roman times, it was probably Tsamaina Kamaras in the south of Megalopolitan territory, which has C4l-second century ad pottery ( LS ii. 283 , cc258 ; Pikoulas ( 1982 -83 ) 264 , ( 1988 a ) 139 -47 no. 95 ). Both Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 and Theopomp. fr. 361 would be consistent with Aigys existing as a named settlement only from c. C4l. We are left with no certain evidence that Aigys was ever a perioikic polis , but it was a settlement after C4m and perhaps in early times.If it was not an Archaic and Classical polis , then Aigyeis (like the later Aigytai and possibly like Skiritai ) may have been a sub-regional ethnic denoting inhabitants of this area who were not politically organised. The territory was Aigytis (e.g. Polyb. 2 . 54 . 3 ; Syll . ³ 665 , post-164 ). Pikoulas (( 1988 a ) 141 , 143 ) identifies it as the valley of the Xerilas, ancient Karnion, on the basis of Paus. 8 . 34 . 5 . Strabo 10 . 1 . 6 (citing Alkman, PMG 92 ) may be correct in calling Karystos a 'place ( τόπος ) of Aigys near Arkadia' (Shipley ( 1997 ) 263 no. 103 ). In Strabo and Steph. Byz., Aigys belongs to Lakonike . Aigytis may have embraced Leuktron and perhaps Kromoi (Pikoulas ( 1988 a ) 143 ; Shipley ( 2000 ) 371 -72 )."
324,Anthana,Lakedaimon,37.2,22.5,506,2487,"324 . Anthana Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 20 , long. 22 . 50 . Size of territory: 1 ? Type: A. (S 1 ). The toponym is Ανθήνη , ηasper (Thuc. 5 . 41 . 2 ; Lys. fr. 21 , Sauppe). In the Doric dialect it is Ανθάνα (Steph. Byz. 95 . 11 ), which is a plausible restoration (in place of Μέθανα ) in Ps.-Skylax 46 . The city-ethnic Ανθανευacuteς is attested (or was invented) by Steph. Byz. 95 . 15 . Anthana is called a polis in the urban sense by Thuc. 5 . 41 . 2 , and presumably by Ps.-Skylax 46 (accepting Ανθάνα for Μέθανα ). Thuc. 5 . 41 . 2 places Anthana (with Thyrea) in Kynouria, and says it was a Lakedaimonian possession in C5l ( νέ µ ονται . . . Λακεδαι µ όνιοι ); Harp. s.v. (quoting Lys. fr. 31 for the toponym) puts it in Lakonike , and Ps.-Skylax (as restored, supra ) in Lakedaimon; Paus. 2 . 38 . 6 seemingly in Thyreatis. It will have remained Spartan until 338 , when Philip II assigned some Spartan territory to Argos (no. 347 ) (Shipley ( 2000 ) 371 , 376 -77 ); it may never have been retaken. Given that its location is disputed, the extent and borders of its territory must remain uncertain. Several possible locations have been proposed in Thyreatis, the northern part of Kynouria, the area long disputed by Sparta and Argos (cf. Thuc. 5 . 41 . 2 ). Tsiorovos and Nisi Agiou Andrea both have Classical to Roman pottery (Shipley ( 1997 ) 226 no. 1 ; cf. 230 -31 no. 10 ; see also under Neris, supra 575 ), but Frazer ( 1898 ) iii. 309 points out that, if we read Ανθάνα in Ps.-Skylax 46 , it would be a coastal place; this would rule out Tsiorovos. (On the problems of identification, see summary in Shipley ( 1993 ) 132 -33 .) Barr . ' s location, 'on Mt. Zavitsa' , presumably derives from the possible location of Athana at Tsiorovos, a village 2 km west-south-west of the mountain (cf. Phaklaris ( 1990 ) 41 fig. 3 ). According to Paus. 2 . 38 . 6 , Anthana was formerly inhabited by Aiginetans; these would be the ones who in C5l also settled at nearby Thyrea with the permission of the Lakedaimonians (Thuc. 2 . 27 . 2 ), as Pausanias is aware ( 2 . 29 . 5 ). Whether Anthana is Nisi Paraliou Astrous or Nisi Agiou Andrea,it was a fortified acropolis in late Classical and early Heltic times (for Nisi Paraliou Astrous,see Shipley LS ii. 277 , aa6 ; Phaklaris ( 1990 ) 56 -78 ; Waterhouse and Hope Simpson ( 1961 ) 131 ; Goester ( 1993 ) 91 -93 , 99 ; for Nisi Agiou Andrea, see Shipley LS ii. 279 , aa19 ; Phaklaris ( 1990 ) 47 -55 ; Goester ( 1993 ) 84 -88 , 97 -98 )."
325,"Aphroditia, Aphrodisia",Lakedaimon,,,325,1602,"325 . Aphroditia, Aphrodisia Unlocated. Type: C. (S 83 ). The toponym is Αφροδισία , ηasper (Thuc. 4 . 56 . 1 codd.),perhaps best emended to the laconizing Αφροδιτία , as by Herodian (repeated by Steph. Byz. 150 . 24 ), less plausibly Αφροδισιάς (Paus. 3 . 22 . 11 , 8 . 12 . 8 ; Steph. Byz. 150 . 17 ). A city-ethnic is not attested. Aphroditia's location is unknown ( LS ii. 312 -13 , nn251 ), but was presumably in the same region as Etis and Side, the other two poleis from which Boia is said to have been synoecised (Paus. 3 . 22 . 11 ). In Thuc. 4 . 56 . 1 , Aphroditia is a coastal place with a guardpost. The only reference to it as a polis is Paus. 3 . 22 . 11 (retrospective but referring to legendary times), apparently in both the topographical and the personal/political senses (repeated by Steph. Byz. 150 . 17 ). Steph. Byz. 150 . 24 seems to infer χωρίον from Thuc.Aphroditia may still have existed in C4m or later (see Boia (no. 327 )). The only reason for including it here is analogy with Side, which was, according to Paus. 3 . 22 . 11 , like Aphroditia synoecised into Boia, presumably in C4s; Side is described as a polis (in the urban sense) by Ps.-Skylax 46 and was, then, a polis before the synoecism; Aphroditia may possibly have been one as well. See further Boia (no. 327 ), Etis (no. 330 ) and Side (no. 344 ). The name implies a cult of Aphrodite. Paus. ( 3 . 22 . 11 , 8 . 12 . 8 ) says the town was founded by Aineias. It is not attested after C4 (except in Paus. 3 . 22 . 11 ), and if it disappeared as a polis by c. 300 , both cult and legend should predate that time."
326,Belbina (Belbinetes?),Lakedaimon,37.15,22.15,450,2111,"326 . Belbina (Belbinetes?) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 15 , long. 22 . 15 . Size of territory: 1 ? Type: C. (S 22 ). The toponym is Βελβίνα , ηasper (Plut. Cleom . 4 . 1 ( 25 . 1 ), 4 . 4 ( 25 . 4 ); Ptol. Geog . 3 . 14 . 43 ; Hsch. s.v.; restored in Phylarchos apud P Oxy . xv. 1801 (C1l) ( PGC Adesp. 1043 (K/A) = fr. 343 , Austin); Phylarchos is thus the earliest source. Βελε µ ίνα is regular in Paus.; but at 3 . 21 . 3 and 8 . 35 . 3 -4 it is a sub-region, not a settlement. (At 8 . 27 . 4 Βλένινα (Teubner) is presumably a scribal error.) The cityethnic Βελβινήτης is attested (or invented?) by Steph. Byz. 161 . 13 . Paus. 3 . 21 . 3 locates Belemina 100 stades ( 18 km) beyond Pellana. The settlement was probably not on the hill of Chelmos ( LS ii. 283 , cc41 ); Pikoulas ( 1988 a ) 122 regards Belminatis chora or Belemina as the area around Chelmos. Possible sites for Classical Belemina/Belbina, if there was one, are Vardouka Skortsinou (C4 to Roman finds) and three less precisely dated sites near Giakoumaiika (Pikoulas ( 1988 a ) 120 -21 nos. 75 , 77 ). Geometric to Archaic finds in the area (Pikoulas ( 1988 a ) 119 no. 74 , i , ii ) tend to push the existence of this possible polis back before 300 . Belbina is called a polis in the topographical sense by Ptol. Geog . 3 . 14 . 43 and Steph. Byz. 161 . 12 , in the (urban and) political sense only by Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 (r 369 ), in his list of poleis from which Megalopolis (no. 282 ) was founded.It is called a kome by Phylarchos and Hsch. Belbina is explicitly placed in Lakonike by Phylarchos and by Paus. 3 . 21 . 3 . The area is Βελ µ ιναtildeτις χώρα (Polyb. 2 . 54 . 3 ), ager Belbinates (Livy 38 . 34 . 8 ), or Βλε µ ιναtildeτις (Strabo 8 . 3 . 12 ). Asthe territory of a polis , if it existed before the synoecism of Megalopolis, it will have bordered on those of its fellow Aigytian towns Leuktron and Malea to the north-west and of the Arkadian towns of Oresthasion (no. 287 ) to the north and Eutaia (no. 270 ) to the north-north-east. Athenaion, a C3l fort (Plut. Cleom . 4 . 1 ( 25 . 1 )), may have been an important pre-C3 cult place."
327,Boia (Boiates),Lakedaimon,36.3,23.04,526,2532,"327 . Boia (Boiates) Map 58 . Lat. 36 . 30 , long. 23 . 04 . Size of territory: 2 ? Type: A. (S 2 ). The toponym is Βοιdieresisacuteα , ηasper (Ps.Skylax 46 ); Βοία , ηasper (Strabo 8 . 5 . 2 ); or Βοιαί , αιasper (e.g. Polyb. 5 . 19 . 8 ; Paus. 1 . 27 . 5 , 3 . 21 . 7 , 3 . 22 . 11 , etc.; second century ad grave-epigram, Forrest ( 1972 )). The city-ethnic is Βοιάτης (e.g. Paus. 3 . 22 . 13 ; restored in IG v . 1 932 (C2m); cf. SEG 11 894 ). The polis is located c. 200 stades ( c. 37 km) from Epidauros Limera by Paus. 3 . 23 . 6 . It lay in the Malea (Malias) peninsula, at or immediately north of Neapolis Voion (formerly Vatika; LS ii. 312 -13 , nn251 ; Pikoulas ( 1988 b ); (S 2 ), followed by Barr .). Epigraphic finds (especially IG v . 1 952 , late Heltic) confirm the presence of a polis before Roman times even if they do not preserve its name. Boia is first called a polis , in the urban sense, by Ps.-Skylax 46 ; in the political sense in IG v . 1 932 (if correctly restored (C2m)). According to Paus. 3 . 22 . 11 , Boia was founded by Boios the Heraklid,who brought men from three poleis , Etis, Aphrodisia and Side; but since Aphroditia (no. 325 ) existed in C5l and Side (no. 344 ) was a polis in or not long before C4m, it seems that the three did not disappear early; in fact the ruins of Etis (no. 330 ) were still visible in the second century ad . Neither Aphroditia nor Side is attested after C4except in Paus. 3 . 22 . 11 (retrospectively) and Steph. Byz. (derivatively). Possibly these poleis or settlements synoecised with an existing polis of Boia in the late Classical period, perhaps as a result of changes in the Spartan state following 369 . See further Aphroditia (no. 325 ), Etis (no. 330 ) and Side (no. 344 ). The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic occurs only on Roman coins (Head, HN ² 433 ). The collective and external use occurs in IG v . 1 932 , otherwise only in literary texts such as Paus. 3 . 23 . 13 . Ps.-Skylax 46 lists Boia under Λακεδαί µ ων έθνος , and the polis can be assumed to have been perioikic (cf. Paus. 1 . 27 . 5 (r 456 / 5 ): τῶν περιοίκων Βοιάς ). The only evidence for the extent of its territory, or for cult places, is post-C4 (Paus. 3 . 23 . 2 , 6 ). Supposing Boia to have been founded in C4m ( supra ), it certainly absorbed the territory of Etis, less than a mile away (if Paus. 3 . 22 . 13 is correctly restored). Archaeological evidence for the Classical polis is so far lacking,though Paus. 3 . 22 . 13 mentions temples that could be Classical."
328,Chen (Cheneus),Lakedaimon,,,184,915,"328 . Chen (Cheneus) Unlocated. Type: C. (S 13 ). The toponym is Χήν , οasper (oracle apud Diog.Laert. 1 . 30 , 106 , whose source may be Eudoxos of Knidos, c. 390 -c. 340 ; see 1 . 29 -30 ). The Classically attested city-ethnic is Χηνευacuteς e.g. Pl. Prt . 343 A, the earliest evidence for the place. Paus. 10 . 24 . 2 and Diod. 9 frr. 5 -7 put Chen, birthplace of Myson (one of the seven wise men), in Thessalia, but sources cited by Diog. Laert. 1 . 106 -7 , of whom the earliest is Aristoxenos (born c. 370 ), located it in Laconia or Arkadia. Chen is called a polis only by Steph.Byz. 692 . 13 ; Aristox. fr. 130 , Wehrli, apud Diog.Laert. 1 . 108 implicitly calls it a κώ µ η . The C1 gravestone of a Lakedaimonian from Koroneia ( IG vii 2936 ) is the only epigraphic evidence for the external use of the individual city-ethnic (in the form Χήν ); the literary evidence comprises Plato and Eudoxos ( supra )."
329,Epidauros (Epidaurios),Lakedaimon,36.45,23.0,528,2340,"329 . Epidauros (Epidaurios) Map 58 . Lat. 36 . 45 , long. 23 . 00 . Size of territory: 2 ? Type: A. (S 3 ). The toponym is ' Επίδαυρος , ηasper (Thuc. 4 . 56 . 2 , 6 . 105 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 46 ), distinguished from its famous homonym in the Argolid by the addition of ηasper Λι µ ήρα (Thuc. 4 . 56 . 2 , 6 . 105 . 2 ; cf. Strabo 8 . 6 . 1 : ηasper Λι µ ήρα ' Επίδαυρος , citing Artemidoros). The city- ethnic is ' Επιδαυacuteριος , restored in IG v . 1 931 . 24 -25 ( SEG 11 894 , 13 259 ( c. C2m); for the attribution to Epidauros Limera see SEG ad loc .; J. and L. Robert, BE ( 1953 ) 138 no. 76 ), and occurs on votives from the Hyperteleaton (e.g. IG v . 1 1005 (Heltic)). In a proxeny decree of one of the poleis of Keos ( IG xii . 5 542 . 22 -23 ; Karthaia (no. 492 )? (C4m)), it is [ ' Επιδ ] αυacuteριος εκ τ [ ηtilde ] ς Λακ [ ωνικηtildeς ] (or Λακ [ εδαί µ ονος ]?). Epidauros is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 46 ( πόλις καιgrave λι µ ήν ); the first references to it as a polis in the political sense are Heltic: e.g. IG v . 1 932 (Epidauros Limera (C2m); cf. SEG 11 894 ). The proxeny decree from Keos is the only example of the external individual use of the city-ethnic. Ps.-Skylax 46 lists the city under Λακεδαί µ ων έθνος ; in IG xii . 5 542 . 22 -23 it belongs to Λακ [ ωνικηtildeς ] or Λακ [ εδαί µ ονος ]. Its territory is not directly named, but Thucydides refers to its γηtilde being ravaged by the Athenians ( 4 . 56 . 2 , 6 . 105 . 2 ; cf. 7 . 18 . 3 , 7 . 26 . 2 ). It is presumed to have been a perioikic polis ; in Thuc. 6 . 105 . 2 an attack upon it is an attack upon the Lakedaimonians. Its C2 boundary dispute with Zarax is recorded in IG v . 1 931 ( supra ); in Paus. 3 . 23 . 6 its territory marches with that of Boia (no. 327 ). According to Paus. 3 . 23 . 6 -7 , Epidauros Limera was founded by envoys from the Asklepieion of Argolic Epidauros. If true, this would imply a date after c. 500 . Pausanias records various features in the town and its territory ( 3 . 23 . 7 -10 ). The fortification walls on the acropolis may be C5 in part, with an extension possibly in C4m (Lawrence ( 1979 ) 147 ). The fortified area enclosed c. 3 ha; the lower town was probably much more extensive (Hasluck ( 1907 -8 ) 179 -82 ; Lawrence ( 1979 ) 146 -47 ; LS ii. 310 -11 , nn235 ; Zavvou ( 1996 -97 ))."
330,Etis (Eteios?) (Map 58 .),Lakedaimon,,,334,1621,"330 . Etis (Eteios?) (Map 58 .) Lat. c. 36 . 30 (?), long. c. 23 . 05 . Size of territory: ? Type: C. (S 84 ). The toponym is /tildeΗτις , -ιδος , ηasper (first in Paus. 3 . 22 . 11 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ητεῖος (Steph. Byz. 305 . 2 ), and it occurs in one of the two versions of an oracle quoted by Diog. Laert. 1 . 106 -7 , which may have a C4 or earlier origin (see Chen (no. 328 )). The obscure polis of ' Εταιεῖς (Steph. Byz. 283 . 6 -7 ; Shipley ( 1997 ) 266 no. 114 ) may be a doublet of Etis. If Etis is correctly restored in Paus. 3 . 22 . 13 , it was 'not more than 7 stades'( 1 . 3 km) from Boia.A possible location is Palaiokastro Neapoleos ( LS ii. 313 , nn253 ), but there is no definite archaeological evidence. Etis is called a polis only by Paus. 3 . 22 . 11 (retrospectively); it is here reported that Etis, with Aphroditia and Side, were synoecised into Boia, presumably in C4s (cf. no. 327 ); since Side is described as a polis (in the urban sense) by Ps.-Skylax 46 , it was presumably a polis prior to the synoecism, and Etis may possibly have been one as well. See further Aphroditia (no. 325 ), Boia (no. 327 ) and Side (no. 344 ). The only possible attestation of the city-ethnic is individual and external, if it is recognized in the oracle cited supra . Paus. 3 . 22 . 13 (if correctly restored) describes Etis as in ruins. It may have disappeared in C4m. If so, Pausanias' sanctuary of Asklepios and Hygieia will have been Classical. According to Paus. 3 . 22 . 11 , 8 . 12 . 8 , it was founded by Aineias; if it disappeared before 300 , this myth, too, may have a Classical or Archaic origin."
331,Eua (Euitas),Lakedaimon,37.2,22.4,643,3241,"331 . Eua (Euitas) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 20 (?), long. 22 . 40 (?). Size of territory: ? Type: C. (S 30 ). The toponym is Ευacuteα , ηasper (Theopomp.fr. 60 , if this refers to Eua in Thyreatis (Nielsen ( 1996 a ) 44 , ( 2002 ) 106 -7 ); again at Paus. 2 . 38 . 6 ). A city-ethnic may be attested as early as c. 500 in the form ΕυacuteΓaltαος ( SEG 35 378 (ML 17 , Syll . ³ 9 , LSAG 220 no. 6 , IvO 9 ( c. 500 )), assuming it refers to this place (see Dubois ( 1985 ); contra Morgan ( 1999 ) 414 , 450 -51 n. 212 ; see now also Roy and Schofield ( 1999 ) suggesting that the inscription refers to an otherwise unknown community of the Ewaoioi (no. 253 ) in the wider region of Elis)). Other forms occur once each: Ευίτας ( SEG 13 267 , from Phonemenoi (C4 )); Ευάτης , on a Heltic stamped tile ( SEG 30 377 ; cf. 35 287 , 39 367 ) from Anemomylos Ellinikou; Ευαευacuteς , on a coin of Eua when a member of the Achaean League ( BCH 39 ( 1915 ) 118 ). Hill ( 1917 ) notes an Achaean League hemidrachm with the legend ΕΥ (cf. Nielsen ( 1996 b ) 119 -20 ; SEG 35 287 ); Phaklaris ( 1990 ) 103 -4 doubts that the coin belongs to Eua. Ευαῖος (Steph. Byz. 283 . 13 ) may be an invention. Eua is probably Elliniko, a settlement with Geometric to Roman finds near Anemomylos,the findspot of SEG 30 377 . Anemomylos, a Classical to Roman cult site, is possibly the sanctuary of Asklepios, of whom a statuette was found. Less plausibly, Eua could be the nearby site now renamed Eva (near Moni Loukous) with the excavated villa of Herodes Atticus and a cult of Asklepios (so Phaklaris ( 1990 ) 78 -90 , 96 -104 , 185 -92 ); but Eva is mainly Roman, and for Pritchett not a nucleated settlement (( 1965 -91 ) vi. 87 -89 ). (See also LS ii. 277 , aa5 Eva, Moni Loukous; 278 , aa10 Anemomylos, Elliniko; 278 , aa13 Elliniko; Goester ( 1993 ) 81 -84 , 100 -6 ). It is possible that Eua was called a polis by Theopomp. fr. 60 , but there is no certainty that Steph. Byz. (the source of the fragment) is not adding his own gloss. The city-ethnic is used individually and presumably internally on the C4 gravestone from Phonemenoi ( SEG 13 267 ), and this is the primary reason for its inclusion here (cf. Hansen ( 1996 )). The Heltic stamped tile cited above preserves a collective internal use, as does the Achaean League coin. The city-ethnic is used collectively and externally in the Eleian treaty of c. 500 , if it refers to Eua (see supra ). Pausanias appears to place Eua in Thyreatis. It will have been Spartan between C6m and C4m (Shipley ( 2000 ) 377 ). It was later a member of the Achaean Confederacy ( BCH 39 ( 1915 ) 118 ). The extent and borders of Eua's territory are uncertain,but it will have included the important cult site of Asklepios at modern Eva, which may have had a late Classical origin. If the ethnics all refer to the same place, and it is Elliniko, it has a long life, though the archaeological evidence suggests late Classical and Heltic decline. The nearby sanctuary, however, may have continued to flourish. The Heltic stamped tile is evidence of the capacity to take a communal decision about a building project, perhaps at the nearby sanctuary. Elliniko also has fortification walls (Phaklaris ( 1990 ) 78 -90 , esp. 80 -81 )."
332,Geronthrai (Geronthretes),Lakedaimon,36.6,22.45,681,3256,"332 . Geronthrai (Geronthretes) Map 58 . Lat. 36 . 60 , long. 22 . 45 . Size of territory: 2 ? Type: C. (S 41 ). The toponym is Γερόνθραι , αιasper (e.g. Paus. 3 . 21 . 7 , but MSS also have Γεράνθραι (e.g. Paus. 3 . 2 . 6 , repeated by Steph. Byz. 203 . 13 )); Γερένθραι occurs later (Hierocl. Synecd . 647 . 9 , second half of sixth century ad )). The city-ethnic is Γερονθρήτης ( IG v . 1 1111 ; cf. SEG 11 911 + (C2s), the earliest attestation of the place); Doricised as Γερονθράτας ( IG v . 1 1113 (Heltic); Γερανθράτης (Paus. 3 . 2 . 6 ; Steph. Byz. 203 . 14 ). Geronthrai is first called a polis in the political sense in IG v . 1 1111 (C2s). Paus. 3 . 2 . 6 (rC8m) says it was a perioikic polis when captured by King Teleklos ( c. 760 -740 ) (Cartledge ( 1979 ) 109 ), but this cannot be relied upon. If the name lists IG v . 1 1133 -34 ( infra ) are public records of athletic victories by people (citizens) of Geronthrai (Hodkinson ( 1999 ) 156 -57 ), then it was possibly a polis by c. 500 . Decrees of the polis use the city-ethnic collectively and internally; see IG v . 1 1111 , 1113 (both Heltic). Externally it is used collectively by Paus. 3 . 2 . 6 . According to Pausanias, the Dorians of Lakedaimon under Teleklos replaced the Achaian population of the preHeraklid settlement with εποίκους from among their own number ( 3 . 22 . 6 , cf. 3 . 2 . 6 ). The probable Archaic and Classical polis was presumably perioikic.It was probably lost to Sparta in 195 (Shipley ( 2000 ) 379 -80 ). Archaeological and epigraphic finds, especially the name lists IG v . 1 1133 -34 ( c. 500 ; LSAG 201 no. 46 , SEG 11 918 ) and the victory stele, IG v . 1 1120 (C5 ; SEG 17 189 + ), found on the acropolis, make the existence of an important Archaic and Classical settlement a virtual certainty. In the Heltic period the city granted proxenies with various combinations of rights ( IG v . 1 1110 -13 ). Two sepulchral inscriptions commemorating men fallen in battle ( ε µ πολέ µ οι ) may provide evidence of Geronthriate military forces ( IG v . 1 1124 ( = SEG 11 915 , 33 313 ; LSAG 202 no. 60 (C5s)) and 1125 ( = SEG 11 916 , 33 313 ; LSAG 201 no. 58 (C4e)); see Hodkinson ( 2000 ) 250 -54 . Paus. 3 . 22 . 7 names a temple of Apollo on the acropolis; Archaic and Classical sculptures may derive from it (Wace and Hasluck ( 1904 -5 ); Wace ( 1904 -5 ); de Waele ( 1997 ) 77 -81 ). Excavations have confirmed the existence of a Heltic circuit wall and of Classical and Heltic buildings, abandoned in C3l (Crouwel et al . ( 1995 ) 47 -52 , ( 1996 ) 90 -98 , ( 1997 ) esp. 58 -60 , 63 -65 , 70 , 72 , ( 1999 ) 24 , 25 -33 ). IG v . 1 1120 (C5 ) lists athletic victories, but the name and location of the festival are missing. Pausanias and Heltic votives testify to cults, but none need be early other than the temple of Apollo destroyed by fire (Paus. 3 . 22 . 7 ); probable capitals and votives from it have been found, as well as Archaic to Classical votive pottery, relief sculptures, and architectural fragments (Crouwel et al . ( 1995 ), ( 1996 ), ( 1997 ); Wace and Hasluck ( 1904 -5 )). IG v . 1 1113 (Heltic) refers to the sanctuary of Apollo. IG v . 1 1118 is a C3l/C2 votive relief to Eleusia (i.e. Demeter); her cult may have existed earlier."
333,Gytheion (Gytheates),Lakedaimon,36.5,22.35,671,3129,"333 . Gytheion (Gytheates) Map 58 . Lat. 36 . 5 , long. 22 . 35 . Size of territory: 2 ? Type: B (but see infra ). (S 23 ). The toponym is Γυacuteθειον , τό (Xen. Hell . 1 . 4 . 11 ; Ps.-Skylax 46 ; Strabo 8 . 5 . 2 ), later also Γυacuteθιον (Strabo 8 . 3 . 12 ; Paus. 1 . 27 . 5 ); once Γυacuteθυον (Jalabert ( 1904 ) 8 -9 , no. 5 , Sidon (C2 )). The city-ethnic is Γυθεάτης , first in IG v . 1 1165 (C2s) and usually thus in Heltic and Roman texts,also coins (Head, HN ² 433 -34 ); once Γυθειάτης ( IG v . 1 1111 ( SEG 11 911 (C2s))). NoArchaic or Classical source explicitly calls Gytheion a polis , but is seems very likely that Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 32 thinks of it as a polis in the urban sense: καιgrave ταgraveς µ εgraveν ατειχίστους τῶν πόλεων ενεπί µ πρασαν , ΓυθείΩsubiotaω δέ , ενθαgrave ταgrave νεώρια τοῖς Λακεδαι µ ονίοις ηtildeν , καιgrave προσέβαλλον τρεῖς ηasper µ έρας ; it is explicitly called a polis (in the urban sense) by Diod. 11 . 84 . 6 (r 456 ) only. The only individual internal use of the cityethnic is IG v . 1 1176 (Imperial date). The only individual external use is IG v . 1 1111 (C2s); in Jalabert ( 1904 ) 8 -9 , no. 5 ( supra ) the fuller specification Λακεδαι µ όνιος αποgrave Γυθυacuteου is used. The city-ethnic is used collectively and internally in IG v . 1 1165 (C2s) and on Roman coins; externally in IG v . 1 1147 ( SEG 15 222 + , c. ad122 -135 ). Gytheion is placed in Lakedaimon by Ps.-Skylax 46 ; implicitly in Lakonike by Diod. 11 . 84 . 6 (r 456 ). T olmides ravaged its chora in 456 (Diod. 11 . 84 . 6 ). Paus. 3 . 21 . 6 locates Gytheion 30 stades ( 5 . 5 km) from Aigiai, on the sea, and about the same distance from Trinasos ( 3 . 22 . 3 ). Epigraphic and archaeological finds confirm the site as the modern town of Gytheio (formerly Marathonisi). The city was evidently fortified in 370 -369 (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 32 , quoted supra ; Ps.-Skylax 46 : τεῖχος ). Archaeological finds, however, begin in the Archaic period. SEG 11 926 (C5 ) is a bronze goat dedicated to Apollo-ineios (Karneios?). Nearby, rock-cut cult inscriptions have been found: IG v . 1 1154 ( SEG 11 927 (C5 )) is to Zeus Terastios; IG v . 1 1155 ( SEG 11 928 , 15 223 ( c. C5 )) may relate to Zeus Kappotas (Paus. 3 . 22 . 1 ); IG v . 1 1153 is a Classical (?) relief to the Eleusinian goddess. For Heltic cults of the polis , see e.g. IG v . 1 1152 (C2 ), 1144 (C2 /C1e). Rescue archaeology has brought to light Heltic structures and many more of Roman date ( AR 26 ( 1979 -80 ) 32 ; 35 ( 1988 -89 ) 31 ; Roman at AR 38 ( 1990 -91 ) 27 and earlier). See generally Giannakopoulos ( 1987 ); LS ii. 296 -97 , jj218 + . Gytheion served the Lakedaimonians as naval base: Diod. 11 . 84 . 6 (r 456 ) refers to it as an επίνειον where there are νεώρια (similarly Paus. 1 . 27 . 5 ; Cic. Off . 3 . 11 . 49 (rC5e)). For other references to the Spartan dockyards here, see e.g. Thuc. 1 . 108 . 5 (not naming Gytheion); Xen. Hell . 1 . 4 . 11 . Ps.Skylax 46 adds a fort. Falkner ( 1994 ) argues that Gytheion developed into a naval base only in C5l. For Roman-period ship sheds, see Scoufopoulos and McKernan ( 1975 )."
334,Kromnos (Kromnites),Lakedaimon,37.2,22.05,473,2167,"334 . Kromnos (Kromnites) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 20 , long. 22 . 05 . Size of territory: 1 ? Type: C. (S 25 ). The toponym is Κρῶ µ νος , οasper , first in Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 20 , 26 ; used alongside Κρώ µ να or Κρῶ µ να , ηasper , by Kallisthenes ( FGrHist 124 ) fr. 13 apud Ath. 452 AB (cf. Steph. Byz. 388 . 3 -7 ; Suda s.v.); Κρῶ µ οι , οιasper , e.g. Paus. 8 . 3 . 4 , 27 . 4 (r 371 ). The possible cityethnic Κρω µ νίτης occurs in IG ii² 9094 ( 365 -340 ), and in SEG 22 219 (Corinth, 325 -280 ); but both could belong to Paphlagonian Kromna (no. 723 ) (cf. Steph. Byz. 388 . 4 -5 ), though it seems much more likely that in particular SEG 22 219 , found at Corinth, refers to the Kromna which was a subordinate settlement of Corinth (no. 227 ). Kromnos is called a polichnion in the urban sense by Kallisthenes ( FGrHist 124 ) fr. 13 apud Ath. 452 AB, if the words in question are not added by Athenaios. It is called a polis , apparently in the urban and political senses, by Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 (r 371 ). IG ii² 9094 and SEG 22219 , if they belong to this Kromnos ( supra ), both attest the external individual use of the city-ethnic. The town probably lay at Martiakos Paradision (Classical to early Heltic pottery: Pikoulas ( 1988 a ) 161 -64 no. 121 ; Roy et al . ( 1992 ) 190 -93 ; Barr .). Accepting the Niese-Pikoulas emendation of Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 (Niese ( 1899 ) 540 n. 1 ; Pikoulas ( 1987 ) 137 , 148 ), it belonged to Aigytis and/or Skiritis in his day or earlier. It was temporarily recaptured from the Arkadians in 365 (Xen. Hell . 7 . 4 . 20 , 27 ) by Archidamos, who left a garrison ( φρουacuteρα ) there. Now or earlier, the town was synoecised into Megalopolis (no. 282 ) (Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 ); it was ruined but 'not quite vanished' in Pausanias' day ( 8 . 34 . 6 ). The pottery (C5m-C4 ) suggests a Classical foundation (Pikoulas ( 1988 a ) 161 -64 ; AR 29 ( 1982 -83 ) 28 -29 ; BCH 107 ( 1983 ) 764 -67 ), possibly by Lakedaimonians. The finds are consistent with abandonment during or after C4 . The story that the town was named after Krom(n)os, son of Lykaon (Paus. 8 . 3 . 4 with Steph. Byz. 388 . 7 ) could be a Classical myth (Roy ( 1968 ))."
335,Kyphanta (Kyphantaseus),Lakedaimon,37.0,23.0,295,1353,"335 . Kyphanta (Kyphantaseus) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 00 , long. 23 . 00 . Size of territory: 1 ? Type: B. (S 14 ). The toponym is Κυacuteφαντα , τά (Polyb. 4 . 36 . 5 ; Paus. 3 . 24 . 2 ); Κυacuteφας , οasper , is found in Hdn. iii . 1 57 . 16 . The city-ethnic is Κυφαντασευacuteς , restored with certainty in IG xii . 5 542 . 21 (Karthaia (no. 492 )? (C4m)), the earliest evidence for the place. It is called a polis only by Ptol. Geog . 3 . 14 . 43 (urban sense); however, the appearance of one of its citizens in a catalogue of proxenoi from Keos ( IG xii . 5 542 . 21 , Karthaia (no. 492 )? (C4m)) proves that it was a polity already in the Classical period. Pausanias implicitly places Kyphanta in Lakonike (named at e.g. 3 . 23 . 11 ). Its territory perhaps marched with that of Prasiai (no. 342 ), since Pausanias gives the distance from Prasiai to Kyphanta ( 3 . 24 . 3 ): Kyphanta is c. 100 stades ( c. 18 km) from Zarax and c. 10 stades ( c. 1 . 8 km) inland ( 3 . 24 . 2 ); 200 stades ( 37 km) from Prasiai by sea ( 3 . 24 . 3 ). It was probably at Kyparissi (ancient fort with polygonal masonry, presumably late Classical or Heltic; LS ii. 282 -83 , bb38 ). It was ruined in Pausanias' day ( 3 . 24 . 2 ); if correctly identified, the archaeology points to occupation into Roman times (Wace and Hasluck ( 1908 -9 ) 173 -74 ; Hood ( 1956 ) 12 )."
336,Kythera (Kytherios),Lakedaimon,36.15,23.05,1071,5233,"336 . Kythera (Kytherios) Map 58 . Lat. 36 . 15 , long. 23 . 05 . Size of territory: 4 ( 262 km ² ). Type: A. (S 4 ). The island (called Κυacuteθηρα at Hdt. 7 . 235 . 2 and ηasper Κυθηρίη νηtildeσος at 1 . 82 . 2 ) and the town were homonymous, so the toponym was Κυacuteθηρα , τά (Ps.-Skylax 46 : νηtildeσος καιgrave πόλις ). The city-ethnic is Κυθήριος (Thuc. 4 . 54 . 1 , the earliest evidence for the town; IG ii² 9110 , C4e). Kythera is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 46 . There are many references to a πόλις τῶν Κυθηρίων in the urban sense (e.g. Thuc. 4 . 54 . 1 and Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 8 ), but it appears that no source uses polis in the political sense about the community, surely by coincidence. Its politeia was the subject of an Aristotelian treatise (Heracl. Lemb. 54 ; Arist. no. 88 , Gigon). The external individual use of the city-ethnic is found in Ephor.fr. 2 ( apud Ath. 352 C) and IG ii² 9110 (C4e); the external collective use occurs in Thuc. 4 . 54 . 1 , 2 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 8 ; RO 96 . 48 , 52 (Kyrene, 330 -326 ), a record of grain donations by Kyrene (no. 1028 ) to the Kytherioi amounting to 8 , 100 medimnoi . Ps.-Skylax 46 places Kythera in Lakedaimon. Thuc. 4 . 53 . 2 and perhaps 7 . 26 . 2 seem to imply that Lakonike does not include Kythera, though usually it includes all places under Spartan control; at 4 . 53 . 2 he locates Kythera the island opposite Lakonike ( επίκειται . . . τηsubiotaηtilde Λακωνικηsubiotaηtilde ). The territory of the polis is ηasper Κυθηρία (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 7 ). Its inhabitants are Lakedaimonians and perioikoi , but used (in C5l?) to be administered by a magistrate called the kytherodikes and were garrisoned (Thuc. 4 . 53 . 2 ). According to Hdt. 1 . 82 . 2 , the island had been taken from the Argives prior to C6m.For the strategic importance of the island to Sparta (no. 345 ), see Hdt. 7 . 235 . 2 . The polis was on the homonymous island, c. 10 stades ( c. 1 . 8 km) inland (Paus. 3 . 23 . 1 ) at Palaiokastro (Huxley ( 1972 ) 38 -39 ; Cartledge ( 1979 ) 122 ). Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 8 mentions the fortification walls of the polis ; cf. Huxley ( 1972 ) 38 -39 . The second settlement on the island was ( ηasper ) Σκάνδεια ( KlPauly v. 221 ; RE iiiA. 438 ), probably at Palaiopolis Kastriou; post-Bronze Age archaeological evidence begins in C6 (Huxley ( 1972 ) 34 ). Skandeia, the epineion of Kythera according to Paus. 3 . 23 . 1 , is called ηasper επιgrave θάλασσηsubiotaη πόλις at Thuc. 4 . 54 . 1 (to be contrasted with ηasper άνω πόλις , i.e. Kythera town itself, at 4 . 52 . 2 ) and τοgrave επιgrave τΩsubiotaῶ λι µ ένι πόλισ µ α at 4 . 54 . 4 ; it is apparently thought of as a part of Kythera town and not as a polis in its own right (Hansen ( 1995 b ) 43 -44 ; Shipley ( 1997 ) 227 -28 ; see also the note by Hansen in CPCActs 4 : 173 -75 ). Hdt. 1 . 105 . 3 mentions the famous sanctuary of Aphrodite, which was at Palaiokastro (Waterhouse and Hope Simpson ( 1961 ) 148 ff; alternative location: Huxley ( 1972 ) 35 with fig. 6 , pl. 4 ). (The island was the mythical place of arrival of the goddess (Hes. Theog . 198 ).) For lead slingbullets found on Kythera, on the island of Antikythera, and in its main town of Aigilia (fortified in C5 ), see IG v . 1 951 . On Antikythera/Aigilia, see further supra 573 . In 424 , the Athenians with allies attacked Kythera (Thuc. 4 . 53 . 1 ), captured Skandeia ( 54 . 1 ), and defeated the Kytherians in battle outside the city ( 54 . 2 ); there had already been contact between the Athenians and some of the Kytherians before the attack ( 54 . 3 ), and soon after the battle an agreement was reached ( 54 . 4 , ξυacute µ βασις ): the Athenians took over Skandeia and placed a garrison in the city of Kythera (ibid.).A little later, the Kytherians were enrolled in the Delian League on the conditions οικουtildeντας τηgraveν εasperαυτῶν φόρον τέσσαρα τάλαντα φέρειν (Thuc. 4 . 57 . 4 ); they are not, however, named in the extant tribute quota lists. The Athenian-Spartan treaty in Thuc. 4 . 118 . 4 stipulates that the Athenians on Kythera are not to have dealings with Peloponnesian League members ( µ ηgrave επι µ ισγο µ ένους ες τηgraveν ξυ µµ αχίαν ). The Peace of Nikias stipulated that the Athenians restore Kythera to the Lakedaimonians (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 7 ); however, Kytherian forces joined the Athenians in the attack on Syracuse (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 6 ), so 'it had evidently not been evacuated by 413 ' ( HCT iv : 399 ad 7 . 26 . 2 ). In 393 , Pharnabazos landed on Kythera; οιasper έχοντες τηgraveν πόλιν τῶν Κυθηρίων left the fortifications and were sent hypospondoi to Lakonike , whereupon Pharnabazos had the teichos repaired and left a garrison and the Athenian Nikophemos as harmost (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 8 ). According to Thuc. 7 . 57 . 6 the Kytherians were Dorians and colonists ( άποικοι ) of the Lakedaimonians. They had the capacity to organise themselves militarily during the Peloponnesian War (Thuc. 4 . 54 . 1 , cf. 7 . 57 . 6 ). IG v . 1 937 ( SEG 11 896 (C4 )) is a dedication to the Tyndaridai by an αasperρ µ οστήρ , perhaps the Spartan Kytherodikes (Cartledge ( 1979 ) 244 ) or possibly an Athenian commander (cf. Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 8 ; MacDowell ( 1986 ) 30 )."
337,Las (Laos),Lakedaimon,36.4,22.3,647,3036,"337 . Las (Laos) Map 58 . Lat. 36 . 40 , long. 22 . 30 . Size of territory: 1 ? Type: A. (S 5 ). The toponym is Λαtildeς , οasper (Ps.-Skylax 46 ); alternatively Λαtilde , ηasper (Thuc. 8 . 91 . 2 , 92 . 3 ). Steph. Byz. 404 . 5 lists the feminine, but comments ( 6 -7 ) λέγεται καιgrave αρσενικῶς . Sometimes it is unclear which is being declined: e.g. at Hom. Il . 2 . 585 , the earliest mention. The city-ethnic Λαtildeος in Steph. Byz. 404 . 9 is confirmed by coins of ad 193 -211 (Head, HN ² 436 ) and Horos 10 -12 ( 1992 -98 ) 564 (Hadrianic). Las is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 46 ( πόλις καιgrave λι µ ήν ). Paus. at 3 . 24 . 6 locates Las 40 stades ( 7 km) 'right' (i.e. west) of Gytheion (no. 333 ) and 10 stades ( 1 . 8 km) from the sea; at 3 . 24 . 8 it is c. 30 stades ( c. 5 . 5 km) from Hypsoi,which is at the edge of Spartan territory. It was probably near Chosiari, on the hill with the Frankish castle of Passava (so Barr ., following S 5 ); in the land beneath the acropolis, Classical finds have been noted ( LS ii. 300 , ll153 ; Giannakopoulos ( 1987 ) 52 -54 and 51 fig. 12 notes Archaic finds from Chosiari). Las is explicitly assigned to Lakonike by Thuc. 8 . 91 . 2 . Its territory would have been bounded on the east by that of Gytheion (cf.Paus. 3 . 24 . 6 ), on the west by that of Pyrrhichos ( 3 . 25 . 2 ). Paus. 3 . 24 . 7 refers to the spring of Galako, which presumably existed earlier; his sanctuaries of Asklepios and Artemis Daphnaia at Hypsoi ( 3 . 24 . 8 ), and of Diktynna Artemis on a cape ( 3 . 24 . 9 ), need not be Classical, but the tomb of the hero Las at nearby Arainos ( 3 . 24 . 10 ) is more likely to be. The acropolis has produced Protogeometric to Roman finds, including a late Archaic or early Classical votive stele ( IG v . 1 1217 ). Paus. 3 . 24 . 6 says that the city was formerly on the summit of Asia, where the ruins of the old city and its fortification walls were situated. A stretch of polygonal walling has been found (Forster ( 1906 -7 ) 232 -34 ; cf. Traquair ( 1905 -6 ) 262 fig. 3 ), suggesting that Passava is Mt. Asia. On the acropolis was Pausanias' ruined temple of Athena Asia ( 3 . 24 . 7 ); it could be Classical, as could his 'ancient' statue of Hermes (ibid.). His temples of Dionysos and of Asklepios on Mt. Ilion, and of Apollo Karneios by Knakadion, need not be old, though Apollo Karneios is a classic cult of Laconia. His story of the oecist Las, buried at Arainos ( 3 . 24 . 10 ), may have a Classical origin. According to Ephor. fr. 117 apud Strabo 8 . 5 . 4 , Las was eulimenos , and Ps.-Skylax mentions a limen ; Thuc. 8 . 91 . 2 , 92 . 3 , mentions naval activities at, presumably, this harbour. The harbour of Las was probably at Vathy Bay, where there are Roman remains (Forster ( 1906 -7 ) 233 ). This is supported by the location of the tomb of the founding hero, Las, on the promontory of Arainos (Paus. 3 . 24 . 10 ), probably modern Ageranos on the south side of Vathy Bay (Waterhouse and Hope Simpson ( 1961 ) 118 n. 28 )."
338,Oinous (Woinountios),Lakedaimon,,,266,1325,"338 . Oinous (Woinountios) Unlocated. Type: B. (S 15 ). The toponym is Οινουtildeς , ο , Androtion ( FGrHist 324 ) fr. 49 apud Steph. Byz. 486 . 9 ; Ath. 31 CD. The city-ethnic is Γaltοινόντιος on the bronze plaque SEG 13 239 ( LSAG 169 no. 22 ; BCH 77 ( 1953 ) 395 ff; Argos, c. 475 ?), the earliest evidence for Oinous and the only attestation of the city-ethnic (an external, individual use) apart from Steph. Byz. 486 . 10 , Οινουacuteντιος . Androtion ( FGrHist 324 ) fr. 49 apud Steph. Byz. 486 . 9 calls Oinous a πολίχνιον , if accurately cited by Steph. Byz. (the unusual noun and the use of ωasperς may make this more likely). Ath. 31 CD makes it a χωρίον near Pitane, but may be drawing an inference from Alkman. Oinous is ascribed to Lakonike by Steph. Byz. 486 . 9 -10 ; doubtless it lay in the valley of the river Oinous (Ptol. Geog . 2 . 65 . 7 ff, 66 . 7 .; Livy 34 . 28 . 1 ), the modern Kelephina. The attestation of a C5e proxeny decree of Argos (no. 347 ) in favour of a citizen of Oinous ( SEG 13 239 ; LSAG 169 no. 22 ; BCH 77 ( 1953 ) 395 ff: Αλιαίαι έδοξξε πρόξενον εtilde µ εν Γνόσσταν τοgraveν Γaltοινόντιον τοῖς Αργείοις ) is a salutary reminder of the paucity of our evidence and the likelihood that a significant number of Classical perioikic poleis simply fail to be named in our written sources."
339,Oios (Oiates),Lakedaimon,37.2,22.25,422,1968,"339 . Oios (Oiates) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 20 (?), long. 22 . 25 . Size of territory: 1 ( 2 ?). Type: C? (S 16 ). The toponym is Οιός , οasper (Aesch. Mysoi fr. 416 , the earliest mention, but preserved only by Steph.Byz. 487 . 5 ); ΟιΩsubiotaῶ (dat.) at Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 24 and Οιόν (acc.) at 6 . 5 . 25 could be masculine or neuter; the assumption that the nominative is τοgrave Οιόν may have no foundation other than similarity with the Attic deme. At Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 , however, Οιόν (nom.) is a likelier emendation than Οιός (Pikoulas ( 1987 ) 137 , 148 , ( 1988 a ) 145 n. 445 , 239 , following Niese ( 1899 ) 540 n. 1 ). The city-ethnic is Οιάτης (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 26 ). (Paus. 8 . 45 . 1 refers to Οιαtildeται , a δηtilde µ ος of Tegea (no. 297 ) in early times; it may refer to the same place.) Attestations of Oios as a polis are only post-C4 and implicit. Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 (r 371 ) may combine the topographical and political senses. The only attested collective external use of the ethnic is at Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 26 , where he calls it a κώ µ η (Hansen ( 1995 a ) 74 ). At Hell . 6 . 5 . 24 Xenophon assigns Oios to Lakonike ; at 6 . 5 . 24 , 25 , specifically to Skiritis. It is the only settlement explicitly included in Skiritis in any source (Pikoulas ( 1987 ) 135 ). In Paus. 8 . 27 . 4 (r 371 ), if correctly read, Oion is an Aigytian and/or Skiritan polis ; but Skiritis had probably been subsumed under Aigytis by then. Oios was possibly at Ai-Gianni Kerasias (Kerasia was formerly Arvanitokerasia; Loring ( 1895 ) 60 and n. 141 ; Pikoulas ( 1987 ) 135 -37 and n. 35 ; cf. ( 1988 a ) 239 no. i ) where Romaios identified a sanctuary of Demeter ( PAE 1907 : 121 ); unauthorized excavation later revealed a large building. Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 26 mentions that attacking Arkadians went up on to the roofs of houses ( επιgrave τῶν οικιῶν ). (See also LS ii. 283 , dd43 .) If correctly identified, Oios may have existed only in the Classical period."
340,Oitylos (Oitylios?) /Beitylos (Beityleus),Lakedaimon,36.4,22.25,327,1636,"340 . Oitylos (Oitylios?) /Beitylos (Beityleus) Map 58 . Lat. 36 . 40 , long. 22 . 25 . Size of territory: 1 ( 2 ?). Type: C. (S 6 ). The toponym is Οίτυλος , οasper , first in Il . 2 . 585 ; Pherekydes ( FGrHist 3 ) fr. 168 ; Paus. 3 . 21 . 7 , etc.; but * Βείτυλος is implied by the earliest epigraphic attestations of the city-ethnic, in Heltic and Roman inscriptions. Strabo 8 . 4 . 4 gives Βαίτυλος as an alternative, perhaps an error for Βείτυλος ; cf. Βίτυλα , Ptol. Geog . 3 . 14 . 43 . The city-ethnic Οιτυacuteλιος given by Steph. Byz. 487 . 17 is perhaps purely inferential. The few genuine attestations, all post-C4 , are of Βειτυλευacuteς , e.g. IG v . 1 935 (Kythera, C2 ). Oitylos is called a polis in the topographical sense by Pherekydes ( FGrHist 3 ) fr. 168 using the unusual expression 'the polis in Sparta'; but as he is writing about mythological material, and as this usage is unparalleled, it does not amount to reliable evidence of polis status (cf. Hansen and Nielsen ( 2000 ) 148 -49 ). Paus. locates Oitylos 150 stades ( 27 km) from Hippola ( 3 . 25 . 10 ) and c. 80 stades ( c. 15 km) from Thalamai ( 3 . 26 . 1 ). It is near modern Oitylo (formerly Vitylo).Architectural fragments found in churches could be from the ancient polis ; part of a possible cult building has been uncovered, and a possible defensive wall ( AR ( 4 ) ( 1957 ) 10 ; LS ii. 300 -1 , ll154 ; Waterhouse and Hope Simpson ( 1961 ) 121 ). Pausanias' xoanon of Karneian Apollo in the agora may be old. The archaeological evidence to date is too imprecise to confirm that Oitylos was a Classical polis , though that remains a possibility."
341,Pellana (Pellaneus),Lakedaimon,37.1,22.2,533,2427,"341 . Pellana (Pellaneus) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 10 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 1 ( 2 ?). Type: B. (S 17 ). The Doric form of the toponym is Πελλάνα , ηasper , as in Pausanias' citation ( 3 . 26 . 2 ) of Alkman (fr. 23 , Page). In earlier sources the name is Πελλήνη , ηasper : e.g. Xen. Hell . 7 . 5 . 9 . In Strabo 8 . 4 . 5 ( Πέλαννα , Πέλανα codd.) and 8 . 7 . 5 , however, it is neuter plural: Πέλλανα , τά . The city-ethnic is Πελλανευacuteς or Πελληνευacuteς ; either can be restored in IG xii . 5 542 . 20 (Karthaia (no. 492 )? (C4m)). Πελληνευacuteς occurs at Polyb. 18 . 17 . 1 . Pellana is called a polis only retrospectively, by Diod. 15 . 67 . 2 bis (r 369 / 8 ) ( Παλλίνην , Παλλήνην codd.), using polis in both the topographical and the political senses. Polyb. 4 . 81 . 7 makes it part of a τρίπολις , implying that it is itself a polis . For Paus. 3 . 21 . 2 Pellana was a polis 'of old' . The only Classical attestation of the city-ethnic is individual and external, in IG xii . 5 542 . 20 -1 (Karthaia (no. 492 )? (C4m)), which lists a man of Pellana as proxenos of the issuing polis and provides confirmation that it was a polity in C4m.A C4l sepulchral inscription commemorating a man fallen in battle ( εν πολέ µ οι ) may provide evidence of Pellanian military forces (Zavvou ( 1999 ) 65 -66 no. 6 ); see Hodkinson ( 2000 ) 250 -54 . Pellana belongs to Lakonike (or Lakedaimon?) in IG xii . 5 542 ; to Lakonike in Diod. 15 . 67 . 2 (r 369 / 8 ); it is a Λακωνικοgraveν χωρίον in Strabo 8 . 7 . 5 . Polyb. 4 . 81 . 7 refers to τηgraveν εν τηsubiotaηtilde τριπόλει . . . Πελλήνην , possibly referring to Aigys (no. 323 ), Belbina (no. 326 ) and Pellana (no. 341 ) with their chorai (cf. perhaps the tripolim bordering on Megalopolitan territory in Livy 35 . 27 . 10 ). In Diod. 15 . 67 . 2 (r 369 / 8 ) it has a χώρα that is ravaged by the Arkadians. It was 100 stades ( 18 km) from Belemina (Paus. 3 . 21 . 3 ), and more than c. 50 stades ( c. 9 km) from Sparta ( 3 . 20 . 10 with 3 . 21 . 1 ). It is probably Palaiokastro Pellanas and/or Spilies Pellanas (major prehistoric site with Heltic (?) and Roman (?) finds). ( LS ii. 288 , gg69 ; ibid. gg264 ; cf. Spyropoulos ( 1998 ) and Pikoulas ( 1999 )). Pausanias' sanctuary of Asklepios ( 3 . 21 . 2 ) may be late Classical or post-C4 . According to Paus. 3 . 21 . 2 (cf. 3 . 1 . 4 ) it was founded by Tyndareos; this could well be a preHeltic legend."
342,Prasiai (Brasiates),Lakedaimon,37.1,22.55,644,3026,"342 . Prasiai (Brasiates) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 10 , long. 22 . 55 . Size of territory: 2 ? Type: A. (S 7 ). The toponym is Πρασιαί , αιasper , first in Ar. Pax 242 ; Thuc. 2 . 56 . 6 , 6 . 105 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 2 -3 ; Πρασία (Ps.-Skylax 46 ); Βρασιαί (e.g. Paus. 3 . 21 . 7 ). According to Paus. 3 . 24 . 4 its name was ' Ορειαtildeται before the Lakedaimonians took it over; an archaizing or poetic form of that name, ' Ορειοί , appears in the grave epigram IG v . 1 723 ( SEG 11 864 . 3 (C3f or possibly C4s)). The city-ethnic is Βρασιάτης (e.g. Paus. 3 . 24 . 4 ; Steph. Byz. 184 . 10 ) and Πρασιευacuteς (Strabo 8 . 6 . 14 ; Steph. Byz. 534 . 17 ). Prasiai is called a polis (kai limen) at Ps.-Skylax 46 , using polis in the urban sense; Thuc. 2 . 56 . 6 twice calls it a πόλισ µ α (cf. Flensted-Jensen ( 1995 ) 129 -31 ; Hansen ( 1998 ) 21 , 25 ), once adding επιθαλάσσιον . If IG v . 1 723 ( supra ) refers to it, it is here called patris . The territory is termed γηtilde by Thuc. 2 . 56 . 6 . The C7 -C5sanctuary of Apollo Tyritas at the kome of Tyros ( 11 km north of Plaka), and that of Apollo Maleatas at Kosmas in Mt. Parnon, may both have lain in the territory of Prasiai (unless Tyros was a polis ). Thuc. 2 . 54 . 6 assigns Prasiai to Lakonike , Ps.-Skylax 46 to Lakedaimon. It also belonged to Kynouria (as indicated by the extent of this area), periodically disputed between Sparta and Argos (Thuc. 5 . 14 . 4 , 41 . 2 ). By C3l it was Argive again (Polyb. 4 . 36 . 5 ; Shipley ( 2000 ) 378 ). Strabo 8 . 6 . 2 locates it on the Αργολικοgraveς κόλπος ; Pausanias calls the area Lakonike (e.g. 3 . 23 . 11 ). According to Strabo 8 . 6 . 14 , Prasiai was one of seven cities in the Kalaureian Amphiktyony, the Lakedaimonians paying their dues on their behalf (presumably after they captured Kynouria in C6m). This perhaps preserves a nonLakedaimonian ethnic categorization of Prasiai ( OCD ³ 273 ). In 430 , Prasiai was captured and plundered by the Athenians who also ravaged its territory (Thuc. 2 . 56 . 6 ; cf. Ar. Pax 242 ); it was raided by Athenian forces twice again later (Thuc. 6 . 105 . 2 , 7 . 18 . 3 ). In 366 , Peloponnesian League troops assembled at Prasiai (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 2 -3 ). Prasiai was 200 stades ( 37 km) by sea from Kyphanta (no. 335 ) (Paus. 3 . 24 . 3 ). The town was at Paralia Leonidiou, with an acropolis at Plaka, south of Leonidi, where ancient remains have been found; there has been no systematic investigation of the area. Finds from c. C7l to Roman are evidence of a nucleated settlement. There are ancient towers and foundations on the acropolis hill between the two harbours ( LS ii. 282 , bb33 ; Phaklaris ( 1990 ) 129 -37 ). We have no Classical evidence of cults, but Paus. 3 . 10 . 7 names Ino and Dionysos, sanctuaries of Asklepios and Achilles which may be Classical, and a headland cult with small statues. Paus. 3 . 24 . 3 -4 gives the story of Semele and the baby Dionysos in explanation of the name of the polis ; this may have had a Classical origin."
343,Sellasia (Sellasieus?),Lakedaimon,37.1,22.3,470,2255,"343 . Sellasia (Sellasieus?) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 10 , long. 22 . 30 . Size of territory: 1 ( 2 ?). Type: B. (S 28 ). The toponym is Σελλασία , ηasper , first at Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 13 , etc., unless we read Σελλασίην at Hdt. 6 . 74 . 1 . Σελασία (e.g. Polyb. 2 . 65 . 7 ) may be a genuine alternative, as may ' Ελλασία in MSS of Diod. 15 . 64 . 1 , 6 bis (cf. Stylianou ( 1998 ) ad 64 . 1 ). The city-ethnic may be Σελλασιευacuteς , not attested before (and perhaps invented by) Steph. Byz. 561 . 4 , or Σελασιευacuteς (ibid. 559 . 13 ). Sellasia is called a polis in the urban and political senses combined (cf. Hansen ( 2000 ) 175 -76 ) by Diod. 15 . 64 . 1 (r 369 / 8 ); it is nowhere explicitly called a polis in the political sense, but Diod. 15 . 64 . 1 (r 369 / 8 ) may imply perioikic status. There is no direct evidence for Sellasia's territory, but Plut. Agis 8 . 1 makes it one of the boundaries of Spartan territory in Agis IV's proposals. Sellasia is placed in Lakonike by Theopomp. fr. 11 , if correctly reproduced by Steph. Byz. ( 561 . 2 -3 ). The phrase πλησίον τηtildeς Λακωνικηtildeς is deleted by editors of Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 13 ; perhaps another word (such as πόλει , πολιχνίΩsubiotaω or πολίσ µ ατι ) stood before τηtildeς Λακωνικηtildeς (e.g. εν ΣελλασίΩsubiotaα , πόλει τηtildeς Λακωνικηtildeς ). Paus. 3 . 10 . 7 places the ruins on the main road just before Thornax. Polyaen. 3 . 11 . 6 probably implies that Sellasia was 200 stades ( 37 km) from Sparta (it is actually 20 -25 km). The probable location is the rounded hill of Palaiogoulas (so Barr .), Laconia Survey site a118 (late Archaic to early Heltic; LS ii. 321 -23 , a118 ), rather than the nearby mountain-top fortress at Ag. Konstantinos ( b111 , late Archaic to middle Heltic). From archaeological evidence, Sellasia was probably founded in C6m and abandoned in C3 (Catling ( 2002 ) 238 -40 ). It was seen in ruins by Pausanias ( 3 . 10 . 7 ). A cult of Artemis at Sellasia is implied by Hsch. s.v. Σελασία . A cult of the Dioskouroi in or near Sellasia is indicated by IG v . 1 919 ( LSAG 200 no. 24 ; SEG 42 307 + ( c. 525 ?)), a votive found near the modern village of Sellasia (formerly Vourlia). IG v . 1 920 ( SEG 11 889 (C6 )) is a votive to an unnamed deity."
344,Side,Lakedaimon,36.3,23.1,171,845,"344 . Side Map 58 . Lat. 36 . 30 (?), long. 23 . 10 (?) Size of territory: 1 ? Type: A. (S 8 ): no archaeological site known; nn354 Velanidia proposed on topographical grounds (Hasluck ( 1907 -8 ) 174 ; LS ii. 313 , nn354 ; Ag. Georgios near Velandia is supported by Pikoulas ( 2002 ) 236 ). The toponym is Σίδη , ηasper , only in Ps.-Skylax 46 ; Paus. 3 . 22 . 11 . A city-ethnic is not attested. Side is called a polis (in the urban sense) only by Ps.Skylax 46 ( πόλις καιgrave λι µ ήν ), and retrospectively by Pausanias, who says that it was one of three poleis from which Boia was synoecised in early times (see Boia (no. 327 ); cf. also Aphroditia (no. 325 ) and Etis (no. 330 )). Ps.-Skylax 46 lists Side under Lakedaimon. Paus. 3 . 22 . 11 says it was named after Side, daughter of Danaos; this could reflect a Classical foundation myth."
345,Sparta (Spartiates) /Lakedaimon (Lakedaimonios),Lakedaimon,37.05,22.3,8908,42596,"345 . Sparta (Spartiates) /Lakedaimon (Lakedaimonios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 05 , long. 22 . 30 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A. Two different toponyms are used for the central settlement of Lakonike : ( 1 ) Σπάρτη , ηasper , (Hom. Il . 2 . 582 ; Tyrtaios fr. 4 . 4 ; Thgn. 785 = Anon. Megarensis ( c. 480 ); Hdt. 1 . 68 . 5 ; Thuc. 1 . 130 . 1 , 4 . 3 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 28 ; Ps.-Skylax 46 ; SEG 22 460 post 369 ); in Doric Σπάρτα (Alc. fr. 360 . 2 , Liberman (Aeolic); Pind. Pyth . 1 . 77 ; IG xii . 9 286 ( c. 500 -475 ); IvO 160 . 1 (C4e); IG v . 2 173 . 37 (C4m)). Sometimes Homer seems to think of Sparte as an area ( Od . 11 . 460 ), as does Pherekydes ( FGrHist 3 ) fr. 168 (cf. Oitylos (no. 340 )). ( 2 ) Λακεδαί µ ων , ηasper (Hdt. 1 . 82 . 1 ), also a word for the region (see supra 570 ). It was already the name of the settlement in the late Bronze Age (Hall ( 2000 )). Lakedaimon, probably in the sense of the city of Sparta, includes the Amyklaion (treaty quoted at Thuc. 5 . 18 . 10 ). For Lakedaimon (without πόλις ) as probably meaning the town, see Pind. Pyth . 4 . 49 ; Hdt. 1 . 82 . 1 ; Thuc. 1 . 43 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 2 . 3 . 8 ; IG iv² . 1 122 .xxi. 1 (C4s); Polyb. 8 . 33 . 8 . In a C4l dedication by a Lakedaimonian victor at Olympia ( Syll . ³ 1069 = IvO 171 , 316 ), Lakedaimon is said to be 660 stades ( 121 km) from Olympia,which should refer to the city of Sparta rather than its territory. See further Hall ( 2000 ) 78 -79 . Sometimes the two seem to be combined for variety's sake: Maiandrios sails 'to Lakedaimon' (though this could be the region) and meets Kleomenes who is 'ruling Sparta' (Hdt. 3 . 148 . 1 ). At other times the distinction seems deliberate: if Dorieus had remained in Sparta, he would have been king of Lakedaimon (Hdt. 5 . 48 ). On other occasions the variation seems to have no special significance: the kings may rule in Sparta (Hdt. 1 . 65 . 1 ) or in Lakedaimon (Hdt. 1 . 67 . 1 ); Ainesias is ephor in Sparta (Thuc. 2 . 2 . 1 ), Pleistolas in Lakedaimon (Thuc. 5 . 25 . 1 ). The city-ethnic also has two versions: ( 1 ) Σπαρτιάτης (Thuc. 1 . 128 . 3 , 2 . 25 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 3 . 5 , 7 . 4 . 19 ); Doric Σπαρτιάτας ( LSAG ² 446 no. 16 a ( c. 550 ); IvO 263 (C6 ); IvO 244 (C6 /C5e)); Ionic Σπαρτιήτης (Hdt. 8 . 42 . 2 , 9 . 54 . 2 ). ( 2 ) Λακεδαι µ όνιος (Pind. Pyth . 4 . 257 ; Hdt. 1 . 6 . 2 ; Thuc. 1 . 6 . 4 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 18 ; SEG 11 1180 a (C6f); SEG 26 476 (C6 ?); IvO 247 (C6l/C5e); ML 22 ( 490 -480 ), no. 67 ( c. 427 ); IG ii² 43 .A. 9 ( 378 / 7 )). Σπαρτιαtildeται denotes only the citizens of Sparta, the dominant polis . Λακεδαι µ όνιοι strictly denotes all Lakedaimonians (Spartans and perioikoi ), but today it is often translated as if Greek authors used it as a synonym for 'Spartans' . This misconception may be based partly on the false premiss that the perioikoi were treated almost as badly as helots. It is, of course, true that the Spartans held almost all decision-making power in Lakonike ; and when Thuc. 1 . 10 . 2 comments on the underdeveloped physical urban form of the ' polis of the Lakedaimonians' , he certainly means the town of Sparta.Sparta was the dominant political community, purporting to speak for all Lakedaimonians; this may be why 'Lakedaimonians' often appears to denote the Spartans. This need not be true in every case, however. When Simonides, in his epigram on Thermopylai (Hdt. 7 . 228 . 2 ), asks the passer-by to take a message to 'the Lakedaimonians' ,he may mean what he says.The same consideration may apply to Thucydides' statements that the Lakedaimonians do not make their allies pay tribute but favour oligarchies ( 1 . 19 . 1 ), and that it was Lakedaimonian fear of growing Athenian power that led to war ( 1 . 24 . 5 ). A telling pairing of the two ethnics is at Thuc. 1 . 128 . 3 , where King Pausanias οasper Λακεδαι µ όνιος is sent for by the Σπαρτιαtildeται : though king of the wider Lakedaimonian community,he is recalled because the Spartans will it. The claim to 'speak for Lakonike ' may explain why a Spartiate abroad is usually called Lakedaimonios , the only epigraphic exception being the lion dedicated to Hera in Samos by Eumnastos Spartiates (Dunst ( 1972 ) 140 -44 ; LSAG ² 446 no. 16 a ( c. 550 )). On the other hand, there are no demonstrable examples of 'Lakedaimonios' being used as the ethnic of an individual perioikos : as far as we know, he is always called by the ethnic of his own polis (e.g. Gytheates, Oinountios; Hansen ( 1996 ) 185 and n. 96 ; Shipley ( 1997 ) 209 ). Therefore, when we encounter Λακεδαι µ όνιος individually, we can probably assume it means a Spartan. Thus, in IG xii . 5 542 , a C4m catalogue of proxenoi from (presumably) Karthaia (no. 492 ), while three citizens of perioikic poleis of Lakonike are listed with their city-ethnics ( 20 -22 ), a Lakedaimonios is also catalogued ( 18 ), and he ought to be a Spartan,as ought the two Lakedaimonians attested as Eleian proxenoi in C6 ( SEG 11 1180 a (C6f); SEG 26 476 (C6 ?)) and the Lakedaimonian sculptor who signed Corinth viii . 3 15 (C5l-C4e). The short form Λάκων ( SEG 31 559 ( 369 / 8 ); Arist. Pol . 1271 b 28 ) is less common. It is sometimes used in poetic and colloquial contexts (Ar. Ach . 305 ; Hdt. 1 . 68 . 2 ) or for variety. It seems to be interchangeable with Λακεδαι µ όνιος , but can be applied specifically to Spartiatai (Xen. An . 2 . 1 . 3 , 5 , 5 . 31 ) as well as to Lakedaimonians in general (cf. Xen. An . 5 . 1 . 15 , where it is applied to a man explicitly described as being a perioikos ). Both Sparte and Lakedaimon are described as a polis . ( 1 ) Sparte : A rare, perhaps unique, epigraphic description of Sparta as a polis is in Tod 204 ( καιgrave ουκ αναστήσω Αθήνας ουδεgrave Σπάρτην . . . ουδεgrave τῶν άλλων πόλεων ουδε µ ίαν ), where the political sense may also be present. For the Archaic period we have Tyrtaios fr. 4 . 4 , West, with connotations of state and perhaps country; frr. 8 and 10 seem to use polis in the political sense. Hdt. 7 . 234 . 2 combines the urban and political senses of polis with a reference to Lakedaimon the district, and includes the polis of Sparte within Lakedaimon ( έστι εν τηsubiotaηtilde Λακεδαί µ ονι Σπάρτη πόλις ). Ps.-Skylax 46 implicitly includes Sparte among the inland poleis of Lakedaimon. Couplings of πόλις in the urban sense with Σπαρτιαtildeται occur at Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 28 : οιasper δεgrave Σπαρτιαtildeται ατείχιστον έχοντες τηgraveν πόλιν and 7 . 5 . 11 : εν τηsubiotaηtilde πόλει τῶν Σπαρτιατῶν . Whereas the urban sense of polis is somewhat rare, the political sense occurs somewhat more frequently (e.g. Xen. Lac . 1 . 1 , cf. 10 . 4 ). Phrases combining πόλις and Σπαρτιαtildeται occur more often (Thuc. 1 . 132 . 1 ; Anaximenes, Ars rhetorica 24 . 3 ; Isoc. Hel . 63 , Panath . 41 , 65 ; Arist. Pol . 1271 b 11 ). There seem to be no examples of Sparta or the Spartiatai being described as a polis in the rarer territorial sense, unless Tyrt. fr. 4 ( supra ) or Thuc. 5 . 63 . 4 ( απάγειν στρατιαgraveν εκ τηtildeς πόλεως ) are examples. ( 2 ) Lakedaimon : Lakedaimon is never explicitly called a polis in the urban sense, though Λακεδαί µ ων on its own often clearly denotes the city (e.g. the Corinthians deliver a speech εν Λακεδαί µ ονι (Thuc. 1 . 43 . 1 )) and ηasper Λακεδαι µ ονίων πόλις in the urban sense is found at Thuc. 1 . 10 . 2 ; note also that at Aen. Tact. 2 . 2 the ethnic Λακεδαι µ όνιοι is coupled with πόλισ µ α (cf. FlenstedJensen ( 1995 ) 129 ). However, at Pl. Leg . 683 D polis is used about Lakedaimon primarily in the urban sense ( τρεῖς πόλεις κατοικίζειν , Αacuteργος , Μεσσήνην , Λακεδαί µ ονα ; cf. Hansen ( 2000 ) 178 ), but the political sense is a connotation, and the reference is to the mythical period. Lakedaimon is also called a polis in the political sense (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 32 ; cf. 5 . 3 . 25 , 4 . 23 ; Lac . 9 . 4 ; Pl. Resp . 599 D; Isoc. Paneg . 64 ). The phrase ' polis of the Lakedaimonians' in the political sense also occurs at Thuc. 5 . 23 . 2 , where the text of a treaty couples 'the Lakedaimonians and Athenians' as τωgrave πόλεε ; cf. 8 . 2 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 14 , 3 . 5 . 6 ; Arist. Eth. Nic . 1180 a 25 ; CID ii 4 . ii . 48 , 360 ). Sometimes,when Λακεδαί µ ων is not called a polis , the name possibly refers to the wider polis embracing Spartiatai and perioikoi (Thuc. 5 . 28 . 2 ). Apparently, Λακεδαί µ ων is not described as a polis in the territorial sense. For Λακεδαι µ όνιοι , Thuc. 8 . 40 . 2 provides a probable example (there are more slaves in Chios than in any polis except that of the Lakedaimonians). Lakedaimon is also called an έθνος in the sense of an ethnic territory containing poleis (Ps.-Skylax 46 : Λακεδαί µ ων έθνος . . . καιgrave πόλεις εν αυτηsubiotaηtilde , including Sparta itself). For the perioikic poleis see Hdt. 7 . 234 . 2 : Λακεδαι µ ονίων . . . πόλιες πολλαί ( perioikoi and Spartans together); Isoc. Areop . 7 : Λακεδαι µ όνιοι . . . εκ φαυacuteλων καιgrave ταπεινῶν πόλεων ; Ps.-Skylax 46 : εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πολλαιgrave πόλεις Λακεδαι µ ονίων . Without being explicitly coupled with Sparte or Lakedaimon the urban sense of polis occurs at Hdt. 6 . 58 . 1 , Thuc. 1 . 134 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 3 . 10 -11 ; Isoc. 5 . 48 ; the political sense occurs at Xen. Hell . 1 . 6 . 5 , 3 . 3 . 4 , 4 . 2 . 9 . The term πολῖται is applied to Spartans (Hdt. 6 . 85 . 2 , 9 . 35 . 1 ) and Lakedaimonians (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 13 , 7 . 4 . 20 , 21 ; Aeschin. 1 . 180 ). Without being explicitly coupled with Spartiates or Lakedaimonians, politai occurs at Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 28 , 23 , 6 . 4 . 26 . There are many references to the πολιτεία of the Lakedaimonian or Spartan state. Sometimes it is that of the Spartiatai (Isoc. Panath . 109 ), much more often that of the Lakedaimonioi (Thuc. 1 . 18 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 2 . 3 . 34 ; Arist. Pol . 1269 a 29 ). Λακεδαι µ ονίων πολιτεία was the title of works by Xenophon ( Lac .), Kritias (DK no. 88 frr. 6 -9 , 32 -37 ), and Aristotle (frr. 539 -51 ). Occasionally πολιτεία is linked with Λακεδαί µ ων (Pl. Leg . 712 D). We also find ηasper Λακωνικηgrave πολιτεία (Arist. Pol . 1272 b 33 ) and ηasper Λακώνων πολιτεία (Ephor. fr. 118 apud Strabo 8 . 5 . 5 ). The verb πολιτευacuteο µ αι is used in laudatory accounts of the Lakedaimonian constitution (Isoc. 3 . 24 ; Dem. 20 . 105 ). The terms τοgrave πολιτικόν (Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 19 ) and οιasper πολιτικοί (Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 28 ) are used to distinguish Lakedaimonian (including perioikic) forces from those of the allies. Polyb. 6 . 45 . 3 refers to τηtildeς πολιτικηtildeς χώρας , 'the land divided among the citizens'(see Hodkinson ( 1986 ) 385 ). Sparte is called an asty in Thgn. 785 = Anon. Megarensis ( c. 480 , Hdt. 7 . 220 . 4 ; and Simon.fr. 11 . 29 , West ² ; άστοι occurs at Hdt. 6 . 57 . 2 , 61 . 2 (cf. Hansen ( 1997 ) 10 -11 ). Sparta is called patris in IG xii . 9 286 (Eretria, C6 ) and Xen. Lac . 1 . 2 and [ πατ ] ρώιη π [ ό ] λις in Simon. fr. 11 . 32 , West ² . Lakedaimon is called 'the akropolis of Greece' and patris in Lysander's monument commemorating the battle of Aigos potamoi (ML 95 c ; SEG 33 439 ; F.Delphes iii . 1 50 ). Cf. Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 30 ( patris ) and Hdt. 9 . 76 . 1 ( patre ). The different uses of the two city-ethnics are found as follows. ( 1 ) Spartiates : internally, Spartiates is not attested in the Archaic or Classical periods. The external individual use is found in LSAG ² 446 no. 16 a ( c. 550 ) and IvO 263 (C6 ) (Dunst ( 1972 ) 140 -44 ); and in Hdt. 7 . 226 . 1 , 8 . 42 . 2 ; Thuc. 2 . 66 . 2 , 4 . 11 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 39 , 7 . 1 . 25 ; An . 4 . 8 . 25 . The external collective use is found in IvO 244 ( = LSAG 199 no. 10 (C6f?)); and in Hdt. 1 . 65 . 4 , 67 . 1 ; Thuc. 1 . 28 . 3 , 132 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 3 . 5 , 4 . 3 . 23 , 6 . 5 . 21 . ( 2 ) Lakedaimonios is much more common than Spartiates . The internal collective use occurs in the list of contributions to the 'Spartan' war fund ( IG v . 1 1 ; ML 67 , with SEG 39 370 + , 44 342 ; LSAG 201 no. 55 and Matthaiou and Pikoulas ( 1989 ); Loomis ( 1992 ) (C5l/C4e)) and the treaty with the Aitoloi / Erxadieis (ML 67 bis ( c. 426 ?); cf. IG v . 1 219 . 2 (C5 )). The external individual use (on which see supra ) is found in C6 in SEG 11 1180 a (C6f) and 29 408 + ( LSAG 199 no. 20 ; Olympia ( c. C6s)); in C5 in SEG 28 724 (Eretria, C5l) and IG xi . 2 161 .B. 59 (Delos), votive by Λυσάνδρου Λακεδαι µ ονίου (Lysander was a mothax , see supra 570 ); and in C4 in Tod 135 ( 367 ); IG xii . 5 542 . 18 (C4m).The external collective use is found in ML 22 ( c. 490 -80 ); IvO 247 (C5e); IG i³ 522 , 425 ; F.Delphes iii . 4 462 .A. 3 ( 375 / 4 ); CID ii 4 . ii . 48 ( 360 ); Hdt. 1 . 6 . 3 ; Thuc. 5 . 77 . 1 (certainly equivalent to Spartiatai here); Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 18 . Coupled with the wider ethnic 'Dorian' it occurs in CID ii 32 . 43 : ∆ωριέων Ευacuteθιππος Λα [ κε ] δαι µ όνιος (C4l). For the use of the variant ethnic Lakon , see SEG 31 559 (Delphi, 369 -368 ), weapons captured from Λακόνων ; the external individual use is found in Xen. An . 2 . 1 . 5 , 5 . 31 . The territory, when referred to as ge or chora in prose, is always that of the Lakedaimonians (Thuc. 8 . 58 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 24 ; Ps.-Skylax 46 ; F.Delphes iii . 1 6 , 369 ), never of the Spartans. Between C6s and 371 Sparta controlled two-fifths of the Peloponnese (Thuc. 1 . 10 . 2 ), an area of c. 8 , 500 km ² (Cartledge ( 1979 ) 7 ). (For Lakedaimon the region, and for Lakonike , see Introduction). The Eurotas valley, with or without the hills of Vardounia and the coastal plain of Helos including Gytheion (no. 333 ) to its west, has sometimes been considered the Spartan 'core territory' . Even if such an entity was not juridically defined or precisely bounded (which it may have been), it seems likely that Sparta had a contiguous territory which was ringed by those of perioikic poleis . In the Classical period it would have been bounded on the north by those of Pellana (no. 341 ) (Plut. Agis 8 . 1 ) and Sellasia (no. 343 ), on the east by that of Geronthrai (no. 332 ), to the south perhaps by that of Gytheion, and on the west by the crest of Taÿgetos and/or the area known as Dentheliatis. The Archaic and Classical territory of Sparta proper amounted to c. 270 km ² , of which almost half was prime arable land (Catling ( 2002 )). There are no ancient references to the so-called Spartiatike ge , a figment of modern scholarship. Instead, post-Classical authors refer to 'the land belonging to the asty ' (Plut. Lyc . 8 . 5 ) or 'the civic land' ( πολιτικηgrave γηtilde : Polyb. 6 . 45 . 3 ; see MacDowell ( 1986 ) 91 -92 ; Hodkinson ( 1986 ) 385 ). Notoriously, the Spartan land economy was based on extraction. The Spartans expropriated a large part of the agricultural produce of helot cultivators, mostly in Messenia but also in Laconia (Tyrt.frr. 6 -7 apud Paus. 4 . 14 . 5 ; Myron ( FGrHist 106 ) fr. 2 apud Ath. 657 d; Plut. Lyc . 24 . 2 ; Mor . 239 D-E). Their farms were allegedly assigned as kleroi (plots) to individual Spartiates from which to draw their contributions to the communal messes ( syssitia ). Lykourgos was believed to have allocated 9 , 000 kleroi to the Spartiates and 30 , 000 to the perioikoi (Plut. Lyc . 8 . 5 ). The Spartans supposedly held equal kleroi from the state (possibly called 'the ancient portion' ,Heracl.Lemb. 12 ; or 'the anciently distributed portion' , Plut. Mor . 238 E); but Hodkinson ( 2000 ) argues that it is the helots' tribute, and doubts that the kleros system existed. Spartiate numbers probably peaked in C5e; they may have increased after new farmland was opened up in C6m (Catling ( 2002 ) 210 -11 ). Referring to 480 , Hdt. 7 . 234 . 2 makes Damaratos say that the polis of Sparta contains approximately 8 , 000 men-possibly the only remotely reliable estimate of total Spartiate numbers.At Plataiai in 479 there were 5 , 000 Spartans (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 2 ), perhaps formally two-thirds of the total levy (Cartledge ( 1979 ) 207 -8 ). Arist. Pol . 1270 a 36 -38 reports that there were 'once' 10 , 000 Spartiatai. According to Diod. 11 . 63 . 1 -2 , the earthquake of c. 465 and subsequent shocks killed more than 20 , 000 Lakedaimonians, but this is no basis for reliable statistics (Cartledge ( 1979 ) 218 , 222 ). In 480 , the total population in citizen families may have been c. 35 , 000 -40 , 000 (Cartledge ( 1979 ) 222 ). At Nemea in 394 , there were some 6 , 000 Lakedaimonian hoplites (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ). At Leuktra in 371 , there were only 700 Spartiates (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 15 ), plus half as many left at home ( 6 . 4 . 17 ), suggesting a total Spartiate class of c. 1 , 050 . On the causes of the decline in Spartiate numbers, commonly called 'oliganthropy' , see Hodkinson ( 1986 ), ( 2000 ) 406 -23 . The Lakedaimonians were the leaders of the Hellenic League which defeated the Persian invasion of 480 -479 (Thuc. 1 . 18 . 2 ; ML 27 coil 2 ; Brunt ( 1953 )). They were likewise the leaders of the 'Peloponnesian League' (a modern name), referred to in our sources as 'the Lakedaimonians and the allies' (Thuc. 1 . 108 . 1 ) or 'the Peloponnesians' (Thuc. 1 . 1 . 1 ). This system of alliances, often one-sided,probably came into being during C6 and functioned until the League was dissolved after the Spartans' defeat at Leuktra ( 371 ), which caused the loss of most of Messenia and some of the perioikoi . (These alliances did not involve the perioikoi ; as members of the Lakedaimonian polis , they and the Spartans formed a single party in treaties.) In 506 the Corinthians (no. 227 ) showed that allies could restrain Sparta, causing an expedition to be halted (Hdt. 5 . 91 -93 ). Soon after, c. 504 , decision-making procedures were regularised (Cartledge ( 1979 ) 147 -48 ). On the League, see Cartledge ( 2002 ); Salmon ( 1984 ) ch. 17 ; Gschnitzer ( 1978 ). There are many references to the LakedaimonianPeloponnesian alliance (e.g. Thuc. 1 . 108 . 1 ) and to other alliances made by the Lakedaimonians (e.g. Staatsverträge ii nos. 112 , 144 , etc.). An important epigraphic example from Sparta, dating from perhaps 460 -380 , is the treaty between the Lakedaimonians and the Aitolian Erxadieis (ML 67 bis (p. 312 ); SEG 26 461 , 42 308 + ; LSAG ² 447g , 448 ), which contains the key phrase h επο µ ] ένος h όπυι κα Λα [ κεδαι µ όνιο ] ι h άγιονται (for similar formulations, see Hdt. 1 . 151 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 20 , 4 . 6 . 2 , 5 . 3 . 26 ; Lac . 15 . 2 ; Isoc. 12 . 180 ). When a treaty or alliance involves Sparta, the contracting party is the Λακεδαι µ όνιοι : I . Dél . 6 -7 87 fr. a. 1 ( 402 -399 ): h ιάλε ταgrave τέλε τ ˜ ον Λακεδαι µ ονίον ; Thuc. 5 . 18 . 1 : σπονδαgraveς εποιήσαντο Αθηναῖοι καιgrave Λακεδαι µ όνιοι καιgrave οιasper ξυacute µµ αχοι . Exiles are attested at Thuc. 5 . 72 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 32 , An . 1 . 1 . 9 ; and Theopomp.fr. 240 . The Spartans, with the Lakedaimonians, enjoyed the greatest military reputation of any hoplite army from the late Archaic period until their catastrophic defeat by the Thebans at Boiotian Leuktra in 371 . On the Serpent Column celebrating victory over Xerxes, the Lakedaimonians head the list of Greek allies (ML 27 ). As in other matters,it is generally as Lakedaimonians,not Spartans,that the army takes the field (Hdt. 6 . 72 . 1 ; Thuc. 2 . 66 . 1 , 5 . 33 . 1 ; Xen. An . 7 . 6 . 1 ; cf. IG i³ 86 .d-g. 14 , 417 ; IG ii² 107 . 43 ( 368 / 7 )), and indeed the shield badge was often a Λ for Λακεδαι µ όνιοι (Eupolis fr. 359 , Kock; Theopomp. fr. 402 ; cf. Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 10 , 7 . 5 . 20 ; see further Lazenby ( 1985 ) 30 ); booty is taken from the Lakedaimonians ( IvO 247 ; LSAG 182 no. 4 ( c. C5m?); Bauslaugh ( 1990 ); IG i³ 522 , 425 ; F.Delphes iii . 4 462 .A. 3 ( 375 / 4 )); Leuktra was remembered as a Lakedaimonian defeat (Parian Chronicle of 264 / 3 : IG xii . 5 444 ; Tod 205 . 84 ). It is possible that in practice each of the five divisions, lochoi , of the hoplite army was recruited primarily from one oba of the polis ( infra ), without there being any formal link (Singor ( 1999 ) 74 -75 ). Chief command of the land army was normally held by one or both kings; that of the navy in the Classical period by a nauarchos (Thuc. 2 . 66 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 5 . 1 ), sometimes with an epistoleus , secretary ( Hell . 2 . 1 . 7 ). Further details of Spartan military organisation and its chronological development may be found in Lazenby ( 1985 ) and Sekunda and Hook ( 1998 ). The perioikoi were integral to the army; at Plataiai there were 10 , 000 Lakedaimonians, of whom only half were Spartans (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 2 ). Until the late Classical period, however,they were probably brigaded separately from Spartiates (Lazenby ( 1985 ) 15 -16 ). At times they exercised command in the navy (Thuc. 8 . 22 . 1 ). Helots also normally served: Hdt. 9 . 10 . 1 says that at Plataiai there were seven helots to each Spartan (no doubt an exaggeration; see further Hunt ( 1998 ) 33 -39 ). Spartans of military age were required to reside in the city (Xen. Lac . 5 ; Plut. Lyc . 15 . 3 -4 ), but their private farms were presumably spread all over the core territory of Lakedaimon and probably the whole of Lakonike ; perhaps their families resided there. Envoys are regularly sent to and from Lakedaimon or the Lakedaimonians, not Sparta or the Spartans (though see Hdt. 1 . 141 . 4 , 6 . 85 . 1 , 7 . 149 . 2 , etc.): (a) to Lakedaimon : Hdt. 9 . 7 . 1 ; Thuc. 3 . 85 . 3 , 92 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 12 ; cf. IG ii² 1 . 45 ( 403 / 2 ); (b) to the Lakedaimonians : Ktesias ( FGrHist 688 ) T 7 , cf. fr. 30 ); Dem. 20 . 73 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 32 . 3 ; (c) from Lakedaimon : Thuc. 1 . 139 . 3 ; IG ii² 106 . 7 ( 368 / 7 ); (d) from the Lakedaimonians : Hdt. 7 . 153 . 1 ; Thuc. 1 . 28 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 22 ; Ktesias ( FGrHist 688 ) T 7 . The Lakedaimonians acted as arbitrators between Elis (no. 251 ) and Lepreon (no. 306 ) in 421 (Thuc. 5 . 31 . 4 ). Proxenia , too, is conducted in the name of the Lakedaimonians. For proxenoi of the Lakedaimonians in other poleis , see e.g. Thuc. 3 . 52 . 5 (Plataiai (no. 216 )); 5 . 43 . 2 (Athens (no. 361 )); 5 . 59 . 5 (Argos (no. 347 )); Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 22 (Athens); 6 . 1 . 3 (Pharsalos (no. 413 )). For Lakedaimonians acting as proxenoi of other poleis , see SEG 11 1180 a ( LSAG 199 no. 15 (C6f) (Elis (no. 251 )); SEG 26467 (C6 ?) (Elis); IG xii . 5 542 . 18 (Karthaia (no. 492 )? (C4m)); Thuc. 5 . 76 . 3 (Argos). According to Hdt. 6 . 57 . 2 , it was a royal privilege to appoint Spartans ( astoi ) to act as proxenoi of foreign states (Cartledge ( 1987 ) 108 , 245 -46 ); however, grants of proxeny to Lakedaimonians by foreign poleis are attested, e.g. IG ii² 106 . 14 ( 368 / 7 ). Citizenship grants may have been enacted by allowing the sons of favoured xenoi , such as Xenophon (Diog. Laert. 2 . 54 ), to proceed through the agoge and join the Lakedaimonian army (cf. the τρόφι µ οι of Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 9 ). Poor Spartans could be sponsored through the upbringing (cf. Introduction). At times of crisis even helots might be offered citizenship in return for military service (Thuc. 4 . 80 . 3 , 5 . 34 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 28 -29 ); some were selected for elevation to the citizen body as νεοδα µ ώδεις (Thuc. 7 . 19 . 3 , 8 . 5 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 4 ), presumably as members of the Lakedaimonian damos rather than the Spartan. A grant of citizenship is attested prior to the Persian War by Hdt. 9 . 35 . 1 . In later political theory the Spartan constitution was famously 'balanced' , containing elements of monarchy, oligarchy and democracy through the combination of kingship,council and popular assembly.To these were added five ephors elected annually by shouting. This constitutionthe renowned eunomia -and the social organisation that went with it were attributed to Lykourgos,who,if he was not wholly legendary, may have enacted reforms in C7e (Forrest ( 1980 ) 55 -58 ). (On Archaic developments see Hodkinson ( 1997 ).) The Great Rhetra, of which a seemingly genuine (C7e?) text in early Doric has come down to us (Plut. Lyc . 6 ), established (or recognised) the phylai and obai (tribes and villages), the gerousia , or council of elders (twenty-eight plus the two kings),and an apella or assembly of Spartan citizens. The phylai (civic tribes) may have been the standard Dorian ones: Pamphyloi, Hylleis, and Dymanes (Tyrt. fr. 19 , West; Jones, POAG 118 ). The peculiar social practices of Classical Sparta, however, were perhaps partly 'reinstitutionalizations' (Finley ( 1981 )) of traditional customs, given new meaning c. C6m in order to strengthen Sparta's military security. The C4 Athenian orator Lykourgos was able to produce a text of a Spartan law ( Leoc . 129 ), so at least some laws were written down. New laws probably required the initial backing of an ephor, after which they were discussed by the gerousia and only then by the assembly (MacDowell ( 1986 ) 6 -7 ). In the Archaic and Classical periods the Spartans inscribed few public documents, but important examples include the list of war contributions and the treaty with the Erxadieis, both cited above. A stele recording a treaty with Athens is to be put up at the Amyklaion (rather than Sparta), according to Thuc. 5 . 18 . 10 (cf. 5 . 23 . 6 ). Possibly the earliest preserved decree of the Lakedaimonians is a C3 resolution in Doric dialect granting asylia to Kos ( SEG 12 371 (Kos, 242 )), beginning Λακεδαι µ ονίων δόγ µ α . It avoids, perhaps deliberately, the wordy formulas of normal Heltic decrees. Cf. Thuc. 5 . 77 . Spartan civic order was famously stable (Thuc. 1 . 18 . 1 ), but the accounts of the foundation of its colony at Taras (no. 71 ) in C8l include references to instability and stasis (Antiochos ( FGrHist 555 ) fr. 13 ; Arist. Pol . 1306 b 31 ). On trial procedures and punishments, see MacDowell ( 1986 ) 135 -50 . Hdt. 6 . 57 . 4 -5 states that the kings adjudicated cases concerning heiresses (cf. Hodkinson ( 2000 ) 94 -95 ), adoption and public roads. Arist. Pol . 1285 a 6 -7 adds religious matters. Beyond that, the extent of kings' functions is debatable (MacDowell ( 1986 ) 123 -26 ; see supra on proxenoi ). The gerousia was the ultimate capital court for Spartiatai (Xen. Lac . 10 . 2 ; cf. Arist. Pol . 1294 b 33 -34 , 1275 b 10 ). Ephors could perhaps impose the death penalty on perioikoi (Isoc. 12 . 181 ), no doubt after due process. They probably did so upon the rebel Kinadon, apparently an inferior (Xen. Hell . 3 . 3 . 11 ). Probably the assembly did not try cases except those involving disputed royal succession, and then not automatically (MacDowell ( 1986 ) 133 -35 ). A death sentence against a king is attested by Xen. Hell . 3 . 5 . 25 (on trials of kings, see de Ste Croix ( 1972 ) 350 -53 ). The eponymous official was the ephoros ( IG v . 1 213 . 66 , 73 -74 , 81 , 90 (C5s or C4e), 1228 ; Thuc. 2 . 2 . 1 ), who acted as chairman (Sherk ( 1990 ) 241 -43 ) of the board of five (Arist. Pol . 1272 a 6 ). According to tradition, the high office of ephoros was instituted by Lykourgos (Hdt. 1 . 65 . 6 ) or by King Theopompos (Arist. Pol . 1313 a 26 ff). Ephors are attested in manumission stelai from Tainaron, e.g. IG v . 1 1228 -33 (C5l-C4e). The ephors were elected annually εκ τουtilde δή µ ου παντός (Arist. Pol . 1270 b 7 -8 ; see Rahe ( 1980 ); Rhodes ( 1981 )). The ephors' official residence was the ephoreion (Xen. Ages . 1 . 36 ). The council was called γερουσία (Dem. 20 . 107 ; Arist. Pol . 1270 b 24 , 1272 b 37 ; Ar. Lys . 980 has γερωχία ; Xen. Lac . 10 . 3 calls it γεροντία ). It was composed of thirty members who held tenure for life and acted as the probouleumatic body: the two kings were members ex officio , and the remaining twenty-eight members were chosen by the assembly from among citizens above the age of 60 (Pl. Leg . 691 D-692 A; Plut. Lyc . 26 ; Michell ( 1952 ) 135 -40 ). The post of kytherodikes , magistrate in charge of Kythera (no. 336 ), was probably a special institution; there is no evidence that Sparta appointed harmostai as governors of perioikic poleis in the normal course of events (Cartledge ( 1979 ) 179 ; MacDowell ( 1986 ) 28 -30 ). The existence of lesser magistrates seems certain from Xen. Lac . 8 . 3 . The existence of an assembly is attested already in the Great Rhetra (Plut. Lyc . 6 . 2 ). Meetings of the assembly are attested in Thuc. 6 . 88 . 18 (cf. 1 . 67 . 3 , 87 . 1 ) and Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 19 , 3 . 2 . 23 , 5 . 2 . 11 , etc. (Andrewes ( 1966 ) 6 ). The assembly was presided over by the ephorate (Thuc. 1 . 87 . 1 -2 ; Andrewes ( 1966 ) 13 -14 ). In Thuc. 5 . 77 . 1 , a treaty with Argos voted by the assembly, the name is εκκλησία τῶν Λακεδαι µ ονίων (cf. Thuc. 1 . 87 . 2 ; 5 . 34 . 1 ; Aeschin. 1 . 180 ). Its early epichoric name was possibly apella (Plut. Lyc . 6 . 2 ), but see de Ste Croix ( 1972 ) 346 -7 . In Xen. Hell . 3 . 3 . 8 is a unique reference to ηasper µ ικραgrave καλου µ ένη εκκλησία . The city of Sparta is 48 km from the sea,further than most major poleis . Its location is modern Sparti. The low acropolis (now Palaiokastro), 'standing out to no conspicuous height' (Paus. 3 . 17 . 1 ), overlooks the northern end of the town.The layout of the town is increasingly well understood (Cartledge ( 1979 ) 102 -29 ; Raftopoulou ( 1998 ); Kourinou ( 2000 )). In Classical and even Heltic times the city had no regular street plan (Raftopoulou ( 1998 ) 127 ). It was, as Thucydides famously remarked ( 1 . 10 . 2 ), an unimpressive urban entity, discontinuously settled ( καταgrave κώ µ ας ; cf. Hansen ( 1997 ) 34 -35 ), but apparently somewhat densely built up in the 360 s (Aen. Tact. 2 . 2 ). Only the completion of the city wall paved the way for the infilling of the asty (probably from C3l on: Kourinou ( 2000 ) 59 -60 , 277 ). Sparta comprised four neighbouring villages: Pitana in the northern and north-western part of the ... [truncated]"
346,Thyrea,Lakedaimon,37.25,22.4,683,3435,"346 . Thyrea Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 25 (?), long. 22 . 40 . Size of territory: 1 ? Type: A. (S 10 ). The toponym is Θυρέα , ηasper (Thuc. 4 . 56 . 2 , 57 . 3 ), which is also a name for the surrounding area (cf. Hdt. 1 . 82 . 2 ; Thuc. 4 . 57 . 3 , if the wording implies that the place captured was not the polis town). The plural form Θυρέαι seems to be used only of the district (e.g. Hdt. 1 . 82 . 2 , who uses it despite having just given the singular form for the district; Isoc. 6 . 99 ). A city-ethnic is not attested in Classical evidence. Although Thyrea is never quite explicitly called a polis , Thucydides in effect twice calls it a polis in the topographical sense ( 4 . 57 . 1 with 4 . 57 . 3 ). Thuc. 2 . 27 . 2 and 4 . 56 . 2 says that the Lakedaimonians gave the exiled Aiginetans one of their own frontier possessions, Thyrea in Kynouria,as a new home.At 2 . 27 . 2 the expressions 'Thyrea to live in ( οικεῖν ) and the land to cultivate . . . The land (named) Thyreatis . . .' clearly imply that Thyrea was already a nucleated settlement, and Thyreatis its territory. Later he tells how the Athenians attacked the Aiginetans as they were building a fort on the coast, whereupon they retreated ες . . . τηgraveν άνω πόλιν εν ηsubiotaηaspertilde Ωsubiotaώκουν ( 4 . 57 . 1 ). Here, too, it is a reasonable inference that the inland town existed before the Aiginetans started building the coastal fort.When the Athenians 'capture Thyrea and burn the polis ' ( 4 . 57 . 3 ), this equally implies that the town was called Thyrea like the district, otherwise Thucydides would have given its name. The 'upper polis ' , the main part of Thyrea, has been variously located (see Shipley ( 1997 ) 231 , and cf. Shipley ( 1993 )). The MSS of Thuc.place it c. 10 stades ( c. 1 . 8 km) inland, which might suit Kastraki Kato Meligous,but archaeological confirmation is lacking (Phaklaris ( 1990 ) 104 -5 , late Heltic and Roman sherds; Goester ( 1993 ) 93 and 99 , Roman architectural fragments, pottery including Classical to Heltic). Other proposed locations are LS ii. 278 , aa13 , Elliniko (favoured by Phaklaris ( 1990 ) 78 -90 , Geometric to Roman; Goester ( 1993 ) 55 -81 , fortifications C4s), identified above as Eua (no. 331 ); 277 , aa5 , Eva Monis Loukous (Phaklaris ( 1990 ) 96 -104 , mainly Roman); 279 , aa16 , Marmaralona Xerokambiou (Phaklaris ( 1990 ) 111 -17 , prehistoric, Geometric to Classical). (See also Phaklaris ( 1990 ) 18 -20 on Thyreatis; Pritchett ( 1965 -91 ) vi. 94 -101 , vii. 215 -22 .) The Aiginetan fort next to the sea must be one of three promontories in the bay of Astros. It is unlikely to be at Cherronisi in the centre of the bay, which is a small, rounded hill not easy to fortify; pottery may include Classical and probably Heltic pieces (Goester ( 1993 ) 88 , 98 , though Phaklaris ( 1990 ) 40 -46 reports nothing later than C6 ). The fort may have been at Nisi Agiou Andréa ( LS ii. 279 , aa19 ; Phaklaris ( 1990 ) 51 fig. 12 ; Goester ( 1993 ) 84 -88 , 97 -98 ), which has a street grid and a Classical circuit wall with towers. This could, however, be a late Classical to Heltic successor of the fort on the same site, since the Aiginetans had not completed their work when the Athenians attacked and may have had no opportunity to resume it. Alternatively, this site may be Anthana (no. 324 ), and the site of the Aiginetan fort might be Nisi Paraliou Astrous, where ## II. The Poleis"

The toponym is Αacuteργος , τό (Hdt. 1 . 82 . 5 ; IvO 630 . 3 = SEG 11 1249 ( 480 -475 ?); ML 77 . 15 = IG i³ 370 ( 418 -414 ); IG iv 583 . 1 (C4l); on this name, see Hall ( 1995 ) 580 ). The city-ethnic is Αργεῖος ( SEG 3 395 = LSAG 168 . 4 (C7l/C6e); NIEpi 10 . 4 -5 ( 470 s); Bacchyl. Ep . 1 . 142 , 2 . 4 -5 ). Argos is called a polis in the urban sense ( SEG 11 1084 . 6 (C4l); Hdt. 6 . 82 . 1 ; Thuc. 5 . 59 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 7 . 3 ), in the political sense (ML 42 B. 32 -33 (C5m); SEG 11 1084 . 25 (C4l); Thuc. 5 . 67 . 2 ; Aen. Tact. 11 . 8 ), and in the territorial sense (Xen. Hell . 4 . 7 . 2 ). Πολιήτης is found in Hdt. 6 . 76 . 2 . The oldest attestation of the city-ethnic in a historical context is in Tyrtaios (fr. 23 a. 15 , West = P Oxy . 3316 ). The collective use is attested internally in SEG 13 239 ( c. 475 ), on coins ( infra ) and in a C4l/C3e dedicatory inscription ( IG iv 487 ) and externally in a dedication of Corinthian spoils at Olympia ( SEG 11 1203 ( c. 500 -480 )), in the list of Argives killed at Tanagra in 458 (ML 35 = IG i³ 1149 ) and in literary sources (Hdt. 1 . 31 . 2 ; Thuc. 1 . 102 . 4 ; Arist. Pol . 1270 a 2 ). The individual use is attested internally in a C3 honorific decree ( IG iv 585 ) and externally on a bronze plaque found in Epidauros ( SEG 26 449 (C5e)), in an honorific decree of Epidauros ( NIEpi 10 . 5 -6 ( 470 s)) and in literary sources (Hdt. 9 . 75 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 13 ). Patris is found in Thuc. 2 . 68 . 4 and IG iv² . 1 618 (C4 ). The territory of Argos is referred to as γαtildeς ταtildeς Αργείας in a law of C6m ( IG iv 506 . 3 , 10 = Nomima i 100 ; cf. Thuc. 2 . 27 . 2 ) and as ηasper Αργείων χώρη at Hdt. 7 . 149 . 3 ; at Thuc. 4 . 133 . 2 the toponym Αacuteργος designates the territory of the city ( οasper νεωgraveς τηtildeς /asperacuteΗρας . . . εν Αacuteργει ). The plain of Argos covers c. 275 km ² and is surrounded by mountains from which streams flow into the valley. The whole region covers almost 1 , 300 km ² , most of which is mountainous. To the north the divide between the hinterland of the Argolic Gulf and that of the Corinthian Gulf follows the Tretos range. The Arkadian mountains tower over the plain to the west: Lyrkeion, Artemision, Kreopolos and Parthenion. To the east is the Arachnaion massif,and to the south the plain ends at the Argolic Gulf. After the destruction of Asine in C8l and the conquest of Nauplia in C7 , Argos dominated the entire valley, which seems to form a natural unit and is well suited to being the territory of one polity (Piérart ( 1997 )). But the political status of some dependent communities remains obscure. Nauplia may just possibly have been a dependent polis : it is called Αργείων ναυacuteσταθ µ ον at Strabo 8 . 6 . 2 ; but Ps.-Skylax 49 calls it πόλις καιgrave λι µ ήν , thus suggesting that as late as C4 it may have been more than just a harbour town (cf. Hansen ( 1997 ) 36 -37 ). There is, however, no other evidence to support Ps.-Skylax's classification of Nauplia as a polis , and the application of the term to Nauplia may be an error (cf. Hansen ( 2000 ) 196 n. 49 ). Others were allies-e.g. Orneai (no. 354 ) (Thuc. 5 . 47 . 1 ) and perhaps Mykenai (no. 353 )-and some were perioikic cities-e.g. Lyrkeia and probably Tiryns (no. 356 ) (Piérart ( 1997 ) 334 -36 ). From C5m the territory of Argos comprised Hysiai, Tiryns, Midea and Mykenai (Paus. 8 . 27 . 1 ). Orneai-almost certainly situated at Kato Belesi = modern Lyrkeia-was incorporated in C5l (Moggi ( 1974 )) but was still a polis in 352 / 1 according to Diod. 16 . 34 . 3 , 39 . 4 . The boundary stones between Argos and Corinth (no. 227 ) were removed in 392 when the two poleis united (Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 6 ), but the occupation of Corinth by Argos was terminated in 387 / 6 by the King's Peace (Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 34 ). In c. C4l the territory of Argos grew to c. 1 , 400 km ² by the annexation of Kleonai (no. 351 ) (Piérart ( 1982 ); Perlman ( 2000 ) 148 -49 ), which dominated the neighbouring valley of Nemea with the sanctuary of Zeus where one of the four Panhellenic festivals was celebrated every second year (Golden ( 1998 ) 11 , table i). It is more difficult to assess the increase in territory due to the incorporation of Kynouria to the south-west. The toponym denotes both the plain of Thyrea and the plateau further south, which was probably acquired by the Argives in 338 as far as and including Zarax (Piérart ( 2001 ); but see Shipley ( 2000 ) 378 ). Argos was mainly an agricultural polis (Piérart ( 1997 ) 332 ), and according to Lehmann ( 1937 ) 77 -78 the Argive plain may in Antiquity have produced some 320 , 000 hl of grain per year. Nevertheless, Argos was one of the principal recipients of grain from Kyrene (no. 1028 ) during the grain crisis of 330 -326 (Tod 196 . 7 ). For the size of population the only information we possess is some army figures. According to Hdt. 7 . 148 . 2 , 6 , 000 Argives were killed in 494 at the battle of Sepeia, and the city suffered a severe shortage of manpower during the next generation (Hdt. 6 . 83 . 1 ). Nevertheless, at Nemea in 394 , the Argives could muster c. 7 , 000 hoplites (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 17 ), to whom should be added a contingent of knights (Charneux ( 1991 ) 316 n. 126 ). A total of perhaps 7 , 500 hoplites and knights in the field army corresponds to some 12 , 000 adult male citizens of hoplite status (Hansen ( 1985 ) 11 -13 , 16 -21 ). The early history of Argos and the rule of King Pheidon (Hdt. 6 . 127 . 3 ; Arist. Pol . 1310 b 26 -28 ; Ephor. fr. 115 ) is too obscure to be told. Similarly, the existence of amphiktyonies dominated by Argos in the Archaic period is still a moot point (Tausend ( 1992 ) 8 -12 ; Piérart ( 1995 )). After the crushing defeat at Sepeia in 494 (Hdt. 6 . 77 -80 ), Argos observed a strict neutrality and declined the invitation to join the Hellenic League against Persia (Hdt. 7 . 148 -52 ). The Argive resentment of Sparta (no. 345 ) led to a rapprochement with Athens (no. 361 ), but after his ostracism Themistokles found refuge in Argos (Thuc. 1 . 135 . 3 ). Argos took advantage of the weakening of Sparta during the revolt of the helots and succeeded in destroying Mykenai (no. 353 ) and expelling its population (Diod. 11 . 65 ; Paus. 2 . 16 . 5 , 5 . 23 . 3 , 7 . 25 . 5 -6 , 8 . 27 . 1 , 33 . 2 ; Strabo 8 . 6 . 19 ; Piérart ( 1992 ) 377 -82 ). A few years later Argos, now a democratic polis , concluded an alliance with Athens (Thuc. 1 . 102 . 4 ( c. 460 )), and in 458 , 1 , 000 Argives supported the Athenians in the battle of Tanagra (Thuc. 1 . 107 . 5 ). At the same time Argos played a dominant role in a treaty (ML 42 (C5m)) between Knosos (no. 967 ) and Tylisos (no. 992 ) and concluded alliances with neighbouring poleis (cf. Hdt. 9 . 35 . 2 implying a C5f alliance with Tegea (no. 297 ) and the decree SEG 11 1084 (C4l) renewing friendly relations with Pallantion (no. 289 )). In 451 a thirty years' peace was concluded between Argos and Sparta (Thuc. 5 . 14 . 4 ; Staatsverträge 144 ). It was strictly observed; but those Peloponnesians who in 421 were dissatisfied with the Peace of Nikias approached Argos, and a treaty was concluded with Mantinea (no. 281 ), Elis (no. 251 ), Corinth (no. 227 ) and the Chalkidians (Thuc. 5 . 28 , 31 = Staatsverträge 190 ). After the breakdown of the attempt to renew the thirty years' peace, a new treaty was concluded in 420 with Mantinea, Elis and Athens (Thuc. 5 . 47 . 8 ; IG i³ 83 = Staatsverträge 193 ). According to Thucydides, the ensuing war between Argos and Epidauros (no. 348 ) was provoked by the Athenians for strategic reasons (Thuc. 5 . 26 . 2 , 53 -58 , 75 . 4 -5 ). It resulted in 418 in the battle of Mantinea (Thuc. 5 . 66 -73 ) in which Argos, Orneai (no. 354 ) and Kleonai (no. 351 ) lost 700 men (Thuc. 5 . 74 . 3 ). A fifty-year alliance was concluded in 418 between Sparta and Argos, now dominated by a pro-Lakedaimonian faction (Thuc. 5 . 77 -79 = Staatsverträge 194 ), but the restoration of the democratic regime at Argos led to a new rapprochement with Athens (Thuc. 5 . 82 . 5 ; IG i³ 86 = Staatsverträge 196 ). By forming a quadruple alliance in 395 with Boiotia, Athens (no. 361 ) and Corinth (no. 227 ), Argos for the first time joined an organisation ruled by a synedrion (Diod. 14 . 82 . 1 = Staatsverträge 225 ). In the Corinthian War Argos was involved in numerous military operations, some of which took place in its own territory (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 17 -22 , 3 . 15 -21 , 4 . 19 , 7 . 2 . 1 -4 ). In 392 the Argives annexed Corinth and forced their own laws on the Corinthians (Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 1 -6 ), but Corinth regained its independence by the King's Peace in 387 / 6 (Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 34 -36 ).Argos was a party to the koine eirene of 362 ( IG iv 556 = Staatsverträge 292 ) and observed neutrality during the war against Philip of Makedon in 340 -338 (Dem. 18 . 64 ), but in 338 / 7 the Argives joined the Corinthian League (Arr. Anab . 1 . 17 . 8 ), and in the 330 s they were appointed arbitrators in a dispute referred to ## 604 pirart the synedrion of the League by two of the members ( IG xii . 3 1259 = RO 82 = Ager ( 1996 ) 3 ). Argos recovered Thyrea ( supra ) and may for a short period have dominated Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 69 and SEG 11 400 , see infra 607 ). After the death of Alexander the Great, Argos joined the anti-Makedonian alliance (Diod. 18 . 11 . 2 ). In the course of the Archaic and Classical periods the constitution of Argos changed from monarchy to oligarchy and then to democracy. According to tradition, the dynasty of Temenids was deposed two generations after Pheidon (in C6f, if one accepts the synchronism suggested at Hdt. 6 . 127 . 3 ). But the king ( βασιλευacuteς ) was kept as an eponymous official (ML 42 . 43 (C5m); cf. Hdt. 7 . 149 . 2 ). The principal body of government was now the damiourgoi ( δα µ ιοργοί ), a board of first nine and later six officials with judicial and financial powers ( IG iv 614 = Nomima i 87 ( 575 -550 ); SEG 11 314 (C6 ) = Nomima i 88 ). In spite of growing resentment among the commoners, the oligarchy was still upheld after the defeat at Sepeia (Diod. 10 . 26 ; cf. Gehrke, Stasis 24 -25 ); but after the Persian Wars the constitution was changed into a democracy (Gehrke, Stasis 361 -63 ), and ostracism was introduced in order to avoid a return to monarchy or a dynasteia (Arist. Pol . 1302 b 18 -19 ). Apart from two short oligarchic episodes, the democracy lasted to the end of the Classical period. The democratic constitution was briefly overturned in 417 and was seriously under threat in 370 (Gehrke, Stasis 26 -33 ). ( 1 ) During the Heraia celebrated in February 417 a pro-Lakedaimonian faction of Argives supported by the Lakedaimonians overthrew the democracy and introduced an oligarchic constitution (Thuc. 5 . 81 . 2 ; Arist. Pol . 1304 a 25 -27 ; Aen. Tact. 17 . 2 -4 , but see Labarbe ( 1974 )). But only half a year later a counter-revolution brought the democrats back to power; some of the oligarchs were killed, and others were exiled (Thuc. 5 . 82 . 2 ; Diod. 12 . 80 . 3 ; Plut. Alc . 15 . 4 ). ( 2 ) After the battle of Leuktra, the oligarchs planned a coup d'état ; but their plans were disclosed. In the aftermath 1 , 200 wealthy citizens were killed, and others exiled (Diod. 15 . 57 . 3 -58 . 4 ). It is a moot point whether the stasis described at Aen. Tact. 11 . 7 -8 refers to ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) (Stylianou ( 1998 ) 414 ). During the democracy, decisions (called δόκη µ α , SEG 34 282 . 15 ( 330 -300 )) were made by the people ( οasper δαtilde µ ος τῶν Αργείων , SEG 34 282 . 4 ; cf. Thuc. 5 . 28 . 1 ) meeting in assembly ( αasperλιαία τελεία , SEG 30 355 . 1 ( 330 -300 ); cf. SEG 34 282 . 6 ( 330 -300 )) at regular intervals, probably every month ( SEG 30 355 . 1 ), but a meeting could be adjourned and held as an extraordinary meeting in the following month ( αasper µ βόλι µ ος , SEG 11 1084 . 1 -2 (C4l)). The assembly was chaired by the president of the council ( αρήτευε βωλαtildeς οasper δεῖνα , SEG 34 282 . 3 ), which indicates a probouleumatic procedure (Piérart ( 2000 ) 303 , pace Rhodes, DGS 71 ). The council was assisted by a secretary ( γροφευgraveς βωλαtildeς ) and seems to have had a term of office of six months (Tod 179 . 15 ; cf. Rhodes, DGS 71 ). Alongside the βωλά there was another council, called 'The Eighty' ( ογδοήκοντα , Thuc. 5 . 47 . 9 ), presumably subdivided into four sections of twenty, one for each of the four phylai ( Γaltικαδέες ; SEG 33 286 (C4l)). Other boards of officials were the five strategoi (Thuc. 5 . 59 . 5 ; SEG 29 361 ( 400 )) and, as commanders of the cavalry, two ilarchoi from each phyle ( SEG 11 293 (C4 -C3 ); Charneux ( 1991 ) 314 -17 ), further a board of four hieromnemones , one from each phyle , associated with the administration of the Heraion ( IG iv 517 (C5 )), and a board of artynai ( αρτυtildeναι ) mentioned in the treaty of 420 alongside the Council and the Eighty (Thuc. 5 . 47 . 9 ). See Piérart ( 2000 ) 305 -6 for details. After the destruction of Tiryns (no. 356 ) and Mykenai (no. 353 ), Argos possessed a large public domain, called δα µ οσία καιgrave ιasperεραgrave χώρα ( SEG 41 282 (C1 )) and presumably administered by the phylai (Kritzas ( 1992 ) 236 -40 ; cf. SEG 41 284 ; Piérart ( 1997 ) 332 -33 ). Argos had its own calendar, and nine months are known (Charneux ( 1990 ) 397 -402 ; Trümpy, Monat . 143 -44 ). The Argive citizens were subdivided into the three Dorian phylai (Hylleis, Dymanes, Pamphyloi), to which a fourth phyle was added perhaps as late as C5m: viz . the Hyrnathioi (Ephor. fr. 15 ; IG iv 487 -88 (C4l/C3e) = SEG 11 293 ). Each phyle was further subdivided into twelve artificial units, probably called phatrai ( φάτραι ) and named after local heroes, e.g. Τε µ ενίδαι ( SEG 29 361 . iii . 18 ( 400 ); cf. Piérart ( 2000 ) 299 ). In each phyle , finances were handled by a board of twelve ( δυώδεκα ), probably one from each phatra ( SEG 41 284 ). In c. 330 a new civic subdivision was added to the two others: in all probability the pentekostys ( πεντηκοστυacuteς ), e.g. Κλεωναί ( SEG 30 355 . 3 ( 330 -300 )). Members of the same phatra might belong to different pentekostyes . Membership of the civic subdivisions was hereditary, but the subdivision into pentekostyes was at least to some extent territorial. From c. 330 naturalised citizens had to be inscribed in a phyle , a phatra and a pentekostys ( ISE no. 41 . 11 -13 (C3f)). In personal names a sub-ethnic was sometimes added to the name and patronymic, first the phyle ( IG iv 517 (C5 )), later the phatra ( SEG 30 355 . 4 -5 ) or the pentekostys ( SEG 30 355 . 3 ) or a combination of the two ( IG iv 616 (C4l) = SEG 33 288 ); for the whole system and its chronology, see Piérart ( 2000 ) 297 -301 . In C4l block grants of citizenship were bestowed on the cities of Rhodos (no. 1000 ), Aspendos (no. 1001 ) and Soloi (no. 1011 ) ( SEG 34 282 . 4 -8 ). In C5f Argos granted proxeny to a citizen of Oinous (no. 338 ), one of the Lakedaimonian perioikic poleis ( SEG 13 239 ), in C5s to a citizen of Sparta (no. 345 ) (Thuc. 5 . 76 . 3 ), and later in C4 to citizens of Athens (no. 361 ) ( SEG 30 355 ), Pheneos (no. 291 ) ( SEG 30 356 ) and Lampsakos (no. 748 ) ( SEG 30 360 ). Argive citizens received grants of proxeny from Sparta (Thuc. 5 . 59 . 5 ), Athens ( IG ii² 78 , ethnic restored), Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( SEG 26 445 (C4m)) and Megara (no. 225 ) ( IG vii 2 (C4 )). Reception of envoys is recorded in Hdt. 7 . 148 . 1 and in Thuc. 5 . 31 . 1 ; IG iv² . 1 102 B. ii . 203 ( 400 -350 ) records a payment to a κάρυκι ες Αacuteργος . Sending of envoys is attested at Hdt. 7 . 151 , 9 . 12 ; Thuc. 5 . 30 . 3 and Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 13 (cf. 4 . 7 . 3 ). Metics ( πεδάΓaltοικοι ) are attested in lists of C5 ( IG iv 552 , 615 (C5 ?); Inv . E 88 (C5m)).According to Hdt. 6 . 83 , followed by Diod. 10 . 26 , the slaves ( οιasper δουtildeλοι ) seized power in Argos in 494 and married the widows of the Argives killed in the battle of Sepeia. They were later expelled by the descendants of the Argive citizens and found refuge in Tiryns (no. 356 ). However, Arist. Pol . 1303 a 6 -8 , followed by Plut. Mor . 245 F, calls them περίοικοι and asserts that many of them became citizens after the defeat at Sepeia. There is no clue to resolving this problem.Probably,the inhabitants of the dependent poleis had an inferior status and acquired the status of full citizens only with the introduction of the democracy in c. 470 -460 (Paus. 8 . 27 . 1 ; cf. Piérart ( 1997 ) 327 -31 ). The protective deity of Argos was Apollo Lykeios (Cole ( 1995 ) 302 ; Foley ( 1988 ) 139 -40 ; SEG 13 240 . 9 (C4l/C3e)). His temple in the agora has not been found, but the remains of an altar, inscribed as belonging to Apollo Lykeios, have been recovered (Pariente et al . ( 1998 ) 218 ). Other important urban cults were those of Zeus Larisaios (Paus. 2 . 24 . 3 ; Piérart ( 1996 )) and Athena Polias ( SEG 11 314 (C6f)), both with their sanctuaries on the Larisa hill. On the south slope of the Deiras hill were the sanctuaries of Athena Oxyderkas (Paus. 2 . 24 . 2 ; Piérart ( 1996 )) and the oracular shrine of Apollo Pythaeus or Deiradiotas (Paus. 2 . 24 . 1 ; BCH 33 ( 1909 ) 172 ; Foley ( 1988 ) 140 ; Piérart ( 1990 )). The territory of Argos was protected by the goddess Hera, whose principal sanctuary lay some 10 km north-east of Argos (Billot ( 1997 )). The most famous festival of Argos was the Heraia celebrated at the Heraion in connection with a procession from the town (Hdt. 1 . 31 . 2 ; Pind. Nem . 10 . 24 ; Paus. 2 . 20 . 3 ; Hall ( 1995 ) 592 -96 ). The Heraia were a Panhellenic festival announced by theoroi , since c. 330 hosted in the various poleis by theorodokoi , of whom a fragmentary list has been preserved ( SEG 23 189 ( c. 330 ), see Perlman ( 2000 ) 100 -4 , 149 -55 ). The festival of Hera Argeia included competitions called Hekatombaia , and a C5f bronze prize hydria from the games has been found in Sinope (no. 729 ) ( SEG 30 1456 ; cf. SEG 30 52 ( 430 -420 ), 366 ( 460 -450 ), 367 ( 440 ), 648 ( 430 -420 ) with Amandry ( 1980 ) 211 -17 ). The priestesses of Argive Hera served for life, and the list of priestesses, collected by Hellan. frr. 74 -84 , served in C5s as a kind of Panhellenic chronology (Thuc. 2 . 2 . 1 ). After the subjection of Kleonai (no. 351 ), Argos assumed the presidency of the Nemean Games, and the C4l list of theorodokoi found at Nemea was probably drawn up by the Argives ( SEG 36 331 ; Perlman ( 2000 ) 131 -55 ). Argive citizens were victorious in the Olympic Games ( Olympionikai 204 ( 480 ), 210 ( 476 ), 222 ( 472 ), 241 ( 468 ), 260 ( 460 ), 298 ( 448 ), 335 ( 420 ) and 464 ( 328 )); in the Pythian Games (Paus. 10 . 7 . 4 ( 586 , 582 , 578 ); Pind. Nem . 10 . 25 ); in the Isthmian Games (Pind. Nem . 10 . 26 ); in the Nemean Games (Paus. 1 . 29 . 5 (rC5f), 2 . 20 . 6 ); in the Lykaia ( IG v2549 (C4s)); and in the Amphiaraia ( IG vii 414 (C4s)).Argos made several communal dedications at Olympia ( IvO 250 = SEG 11 1203 ( 500 -480 ?), 251 ( 500 -480 ); SEG 11 1203 nos. 3 -5 ( 500 -480 ): Corinthian spoils) and Delphi (Jacquemin ( 1999 ) nos. 71 (C6e), 72 (C6e), 74 (C5f), 70 ( 456 ), 68 (C5m), 67 (C5l), 69 ( 369 )). Consultation of the oracle at Delphi is recorded by Hdt. 6 . 19 . 1 . The site of Argos is dominated by two hills, one much higher than the other: to the south, Larisa with escarpments rising to c. 290 m ( άκρα : Strabo 8 . 6 . 7 ; ακρόπολις : Strabo 8 . 6 . 9 ; Paus. 2 . 24 . 1 ), and to the north Profites Elias, called Aspis (the shield), a rocky outcrop of less than 90 m.Its real name was almost certainly Deiras (Piérart ( 1990 ) 327 -28 ). Larisa and Deiras were both surrounded by a defence circuit, of which only parts have been recovered. The oldest remains date from C6 . In the Classical period the walls seem to have enclosed an area of over 200 ha (Lang ( 1996 ) 174 and Abb. 34 ). An attempt in 417 / 16 to construct a set of long walls down to the sea was stopped by Spartan intervention (Thuc. 5 . 82 . 5 -83 . 2 ). The ancient town grew up on the south side of the Larisa hill.The habitation area was organised around the axes of the thoroughfares. The oldest of the city's two theatres was built into the eastern spur of Larisa hill,called Pron (the promontory). It had a nearly rectangular koilon of between thirty-seven and thirty-eight straight rows of seats accommodating c. 2 , 700 -3 , 000 persons,and it seems to have served as meeting-place of the assembly and the courts ( TGR ii. 123 ). In C3e a curved theatre of the canonical type was constructed in its vicinity (Piérart ( 1998 ) 344 -45 ; ## 606 pirart Hansen and Fischer-Hansen ( 1994 ) 56 -57 ; TGR ii. 125 -26 ). The agora (Thuc. 5 . 47 . 11 ) occupied a low-lying area below the theatre. Here stood the temple of Apollo Lykeios, the most famous sanctuary of the city of Argos (Paus. 2 . 19 . 3 ), where public enactments were set up (Thuc. 5 . 47 . 11 ; SEG 34 282 . 16 ). The oldest known public political building is the hypostyle hall; it was constructed c. 475 -450 and probably served as bouleuterion (Bommelaer and des Courtils ( 1994 )) ( SEG 31 315 , 41 284 ). East of this, some Archaic buildings apparently used for administrative purposes were replaced in the period 450 -425 by a large building flanked by three colonnades.It was used as a gymnasion and served a number of other purposes. It contained a long narrow court flanked by a colonnade (Pariente et al . ( 1998 ) 213 -14 , 218 ). North of this building a C4s stadion 180 m ( = 1 stade) long was laid out towards the east (ibid. 216 , 218 -19 ). The north and east sides of the agora were bordered by two stoas (ibid. 214 -15 ). In, probably, 315 Kassander's general Apollonides had the prytaneion burnt down and killed 500 Argives who were gathered in the building (Diod. 19 . 63 . 2 ). The prison of Argos is mentioned in Arist. Rh . 1375 a 5 -6 . In literary sources (Ephor. frr. 115 , 176 ) the invention of coinage is erroneously attributed to Pheidon,the C7f king of Argos. But Argos struck coins only from C5e (before c. 480 ) and onwards.( 1 ) Silver, from before 480 onwards;denominations: drachm, tetrobol, hemidrachm and smaller denominations down to tetartemorion; types: obv . forepart of wolf; rev . Α in incuse. ( 2 ) These types are also found on a C5 -C4 issue of iron coins. ( 3 ) Silver, from c. 421 onwards; denominations: stater, drachm and smaller denominations; types: obv . head of Hera wearing stephanos ; rev . various types, often two dolphins swimming in opposite direction,legend: on some ΑΡΓΕΙΟΝ or ΑΡΓΕΙΩΝ . ( 4 ) Bronze from C4 onwards with various types (for the date, see IGCH no. 11 and Kraay ( 1976 ) 96 ); Babelon, Traité ii. 3 . 447 -75 ; SNG Cop. Argolis 1 -66 )."

The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in an honorific decree ( NIEpi 10 . 5 -5 ( 470 s): τοπιδαυacuteριοι ) and in a dedication of an Argive ( SEG 26 449 = Nomima ii 28 (C5f)), and externally on the Serpent Column in Delphi (ML 23 . 4 ) and in literary sources (Hdt. 5 . 82 -84 ; Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ). The individual use is found internally in a dedication of an Epidaurian ( SEG 11 438 (C4s)) and externally at Delphi, where an Epidaurian made a dedication to Apollo in C5 ( F.Delphes iii . 4 195 ) and an Astias of Epidauros served as naopoios in 356 / 5 ( CID ii 31 . 35 ), and in Olympia on a monument commemorating the Olympic victor Aristion ( IvO 165 (C4m); Olympionikai 415 ). It is presumably called patra ( = patris ) in IG iv² . 1 619 (C4 ?). The name of the territory is ηasper ' Επιδαυρία γηtilde (Thuc. 4 . 45 . 2 ) or ηasper ' Επίδαυρος , where the toponym denotes the territory (Thuc. 5 . 55 . 1 , 77 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 18 ; cf. Ps.-Skylax 50 , 54 : ηasper ' Επίδαυρος χώρα ). It covered 473 km ² (Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 18 ). The frontier between Epidauros and Troizen (no. 357 ) was near Methana (no. 352 ) (Thuc. 4 . 45 . 2 ); to the west, the frontier towards Argos (no. 347 ) was at Mt. Arachnaion. The Epidaurians possessed part of the coast of the Argolic Gulf but had no harbour there (Ps.-Skylax 50 ). A C5 dedication found in the Iria plain indicates that the plain belonged to Epidauros ( SEG 24 274 ; cf. Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 570 ). In 480 Epidauros provided eight triremes at Artemision (Hdt. 8 . 1 . 2 ) and ten at Salamis (Hdt. 8 . 43 ), as well as 800 men at Plataiai in 479 (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 4 ). Assuming that there is no overlap between the forces,Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 556 -59 estimates the military strength of Troizen at 2 , 800 men,and the total population at c. 16 , 000 minimum and 23 , 500 maximum. Epidauros was a member of the Kalaurian amphiktyony (Strabo 8 . 6 . 14 ; Tausend ( 1992 ) 12 -19 ). In C5e, after the Argive defeat at Sepeia, Epidauros gave shelter to some Argive refugees ( SEG 26 449 = Nomima ii 28 (C5f); cf. Lambrinoudakis ( 1990 )). Epidauros fought on the Greek side in the Persian War (Hdt. 8 . 1 . 2 , 43 , 9 . 28 . 4 ), and is recorded on the Serpent Column in Delphi (ML 27 . 4 ) and in Olympia (Paus. 5 . 23 . 1 -2 ). It was a member of the Peloponnesian League (Thuc. 5 . 57 . 1 ). Alongside the Corinthians they defeated the Athenians at Halieis in 460 / 59 (Thuc. 1 . 105 . 1 ). In 435 the Epidaurians supported Corinth (no. 227 ) against Korkyra (no. 123 ) with five triremes (Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 ). From 430 the Athenians ravaged the territory of Epidauros (Thuc. 2 . 56 . 4 -5 , 4 . 45 . 2 , 6 . 31 . 2 ). Controlling a territory which bordered on the Gulf of Argos but also had an excellent harbour on the Saronic Gulf, Epidauros occupied a strategic position and was an indispensable link in all relations between Athens (no. 361 ) and Argos (no. 347 ). A war between Argos and Epidauros was fought in 419 -418 , caused by a sacrifice owed by the Epidaurians to Apollo Pythaios (Thuc. 5 . 53 . 1 ). The territory of Epidauros was repeatedly plundered by the Argives (Thuc. 5 . 54 . 3 -55 . 4 ). The Epidaurians received a Lakedaimonian garrison, and an Argive attack on the town was called off (Thuc. 5 . 56 ). After the battle of Mantinea, the Athenians, being allied with the Argives, built a blockading wall around the town of Epidauros,but in 418 / 17 a peace was concluded between Lakedaimon and Argos in which it was stipulated that the blockading wall be pulled down and the Argive and Athenian troops withdrawn from the territory of Epidauros (Thuc. 5 . 77 . 1 ). After the Athenian defeat at Syracuse, Epidauros took an active part in the mobilisation of a Peloponnesian fleet (Thuc. 8 . 3 . 2 ), and after the battle of Aigos potamoi in 405 , a statue was set up in Delphi of the commander of the Epidaurian squadron (Paus. 10 . 9 . 10 ). Epidauros fought on the Spartan side in the battle of Nemea (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ) and remained loyal to Sparta (no. 345 ) even after the battle of Leuktra (Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 3 , 7 . 2 . 2 ). In 369 Epaminondas ravaged the territory of Epidauros but failed to conquer the city (Diod. 15 . 69 . 1 ). Alongside Sparta and other members of the Peloponnesian League, Epidauros concluded an alliance with Athens in 370 / 69 (Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 1 , 2 . 2 ; Arist. Rh . 1411 a 11 -13 ; cf. Staatsverträge 274 ); but in 366 / 5 Epidauros appears as an ally of Thebes (no. 221 ) (Isoc. 6 . 91 ; cf. Staatsverträge 285 ). After the battle of Chaironeia in 338 , Epidauros may have become a dependency of Argos (Burford ( 1969 ) 17 ), and there may have been an Argive klerouchy in Epidauros ( IG iv² . 1 69 and SEG 11 400 , if restored: [ ευεργέ ] ταν εῖ µ εν τουtilde [ δά µ ου Αργείων εν ' Ε ] πιδαυacuteρωι κα [ τοικουacuteντων . έλεξε ] Πειθίλα [ ς ]). Epidauros joined the revolt against Makedonia after the death of Alexander the Great (Diod. 18 . 11 . 2 ). In C5s the sanctuary of Asklepios transformed Epidauros into a Panhellenic site visited by pilgrims from all parts. Contacts with other poleis increased because of the pilgrims and the erection of monumental buildings in the sanctuary. Construction began in the second quarter of C4 , and the accounts mention heralds sent not only to neighbouring poleis but even to some more remote cities, such as Athens, Tegea (no. 297 ) and Thebes (no. 221 ) ( IG iv² . 1 102 , 103 ), from which artisans came to Epidauros (Burford ( 1969 ) 16 -18 ). From the 350 s, inscriptions attest to the sending out of theoroi and the appointment of theorodokoi in other poleis . We have preserved lists of theorodokoi in the various poleis recorded region by region in accordance with the itinerary of the theoroi ( IG iv² . 1 94 -95 = Perlman ( 2000 ) E 1 -2 ( 350 s)), decrees endowing individuals with the title of theorodokos , sometimes connected with the title of proxenos ( SEG 26 445 = Perlman ( 2000 ) E 12 p. 200 (C4m)), and chronologically organised surveys of such decrees passed by the Epidaurians ( IG iv² . 1 96 = Perlman ( 2000 ) E 3 (C3f)). For an account of the institution of theorodokia , see Perlman ( 2000 ) 81 -95 . Citizens of Epidauros were appointed proxenoi by Karthaia (no. 492 ) ( IG xii . 4 542 . 15 -16 (C4m)) and Megara (no. 225 ) ( IG vii 13 (C4l)). The Aristotelian collection of politeiai included a constitution of the Epidaurians (Arist. fr. 498 ), and the first entry in Plutarch's Aitia Graeca may stem from this work: there were in Epidauros 180 enfranchised citizens; they constituted the politeuma from which were elected the councillors ( bouleutai ), in Epidauros called artynoi . Most of the common people were settled in the countryside and nicknamed κονίποδες , i.e. those with dust on their feet (Plut. Mor . 291 E). No date is indicated, but the narrow politeuma points to an oligarchy in the Archaic period. In C7s Epidauros was ruled by a tyrant called Prokles, whose daughter was married to Periander, the tyrant of Corinth (no. 227 ) (Hdt. 3 . 50 -52 ). The numerous decrees passed in C4 by boule and demos (Rhodes, DGS 74 ) point to a democratic constitution. The Epidaurians were Dorians (Hdt. 1 . 146 . 1 , 7 . 99 . 2 -3 ), and in C4 the citizens were organised into four phylai : two of the old Dorian phylai , Dymanes and Hylleis, and two other phylai , Azantioi and Hysminatai ( IG iv² . 1 106 . iii . 37 -40 (C4 )). The subdivision into phylai was applied in the working of political institutions, the composition of boards of officials, and the organisation of the army. The four phylai were further subdivided into at least thirty-nine territorial units (Jones, POAG 107 -11 ; Perlman ( 2000 ) 85 -87 ). The names of these units were used as sub-ethnics to identify Epidaurian citizens) (see IG iv² . 1 58 . 5 : Τι µ οκράτης Παγασίνα ). The combination of a personal and a territorial subdivision of the citizenry remains problematic.Perhaps the citizens were reassigned to the various phylai in accordance with their place of residence. In C4 decrees were passed by the boule and the demos and authenticated by a magistrate called κατάλογος βουλαtildeς ( SEG 26 445 (C4m); cf. Rhodes, DGS 73 -74 ). The priest of Asklepios served as eponymous official ( IG iv² . 1 103 ; cf. Sherk ( 1990 ) 267 -68 ). The Epidaurian calendar was of the Doric type, and all months are attested (Trümpy, Monat . 140 -43 ). At Ps.-Skylax 54 (cf. Paus. 2 . 29 . 1 ) the urban centre is described as πόλις καιgrave λι µ ήν . It lay on the Saronic Gulf west of Aigina (no. 358 ) and the peninsula of Methana (no. 352 ). ## 608 pirart The remains are partly submerged and have not been systematically explored. The town occupied a peninsula consisting of two hills, Nisi, with a harbour on either side. Pausanias saw six temples in the town, on the acropolis and near the harbour ( 2 . 29 . 1 ). The theatre was situated on the western slope of the acropolis and has been excavated (Deilaki-Protonotariou ( 1972 ), ( 1973 )). It dates to C4 -Hell. ( TGR ii. 213 ), accommodated some 5 , 000 -6 , 000 persons, and had seats inscribed with the names of magistrates and citizens of the period c. 350 -200 ( SEG 26 452 ). A boundary stone inscribed οasperacuteρος αγοραtildeς found on the neck of the peninsula indicates that the agora was near the theatre ( SEG 26 452 ). Epidauros was fortified in C5 (Thuc. 5 . 56 . 5 , 75 . 5 ). The sanctuary of Asklepios was situated inland some 9 km south of the harbour. The peak of Mt. Kynortion, which rises behind the theatre, was consecrated to Apollo Maleatas,whose sanctuary was believed to be very old (Paus. 2 . 27 . 7 ). The remains indicate that it was in continuous use from C7s onwards (Paus. 2 . 27 . 7 ; Lambrinoudakis ( 1980 )). Apollo Maleatas was persistently associated with Asklepios, originally a hero with healing powers, later worshipped as the god of medicine and the tutelary god of Epidauros (Paus. 2 . 26 . 3 ). His cult can be traced back to C6 ( IG iv² . 1 136 (C6l/C5e)). From C4f onwards the Epidaurians implemented an ambitious building programme. The accounts are partially preserved ( IG iv² . 1 102 -20 (C4 -C3e)). Famous architects and sculptors were invited, among them Polykleitos the Younger, allegedly responsible for the plans of the theatre ( TGR ii. 208 -10 ) and the tholos (Paus. 2 . 27 -8 . 1 ; cf. Roux ( 1961 ); Burford ( 1969 )). Several Epidaurian citizens were victorious in the Olympic Games ( Olympionikai 19 ( 712 ), 74 ( 608 ), 77 ( 600 ), 223 ( 472 ), 415 ( 368 )). Participation in the Nemean Games is indicated by the city's possession of an oikos in Nemea ( SEG 26 420 ; Miller ( 1990 ) 71 , 119 ). The Asklepiaia can be traced back to C6l through the victory in boxing and pankration won by Themistios, the ancestor of Pytheas of Aigina, who was active c. 490 -480 (Pind. Nem . 5 . 53 ). Whereas Apollo Maleatas is closely associated with Asklepios in the healing inscriptions, there is no connection with the Games before C3m (Perlman ( 2000 ) 82 ). In the beginning the Games mostly attracted local contestants, but in C4 they acquired Panhellenic status. Thus, the rhapsode Ion of Ephesos (no. 844 ) took part in the games c. 390 (Pl. Io 530 B; cf. Sève ( 1993 )). Epidauros struck coins of silver and bronze from c. 350 onwards. ( 1 ) Silver on the Aiginetan standard, c. 350 -323 or later; denominations: drachm, hemidrachm, obol, tetarte- morion;types: obv . head of Asklepios laureate; rev .

According to Hdt. 7 . 99 . 3 , Epidauros colonised Kos (no. 499 ), Nisyros (no. 508 ) and Kalymna (no. 485 ); in the Archaic period the Epidaurians controlled Aigina (no. 358 ; Hdt. 5 . 83 . 1 )."
349,Halieis (Halikos),Argolis,37.2,23.1,1197,5620,"349 . Halieis (Halikos) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 20 , long. 23 . 10 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Αasperλιεῖς , οιasper ( IG i³ 1147 . 3 ( c. 460 ); Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 3 ; Diod. 11 . 78 . 2 ), or Αasperλία , ηasper (Ps.Skylax 50 ) or, in a late source only, Αasperλική (Paus. 2 . 36 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is, in the plural form, Αasperλιεῖς (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ), from * Αasperλιευacuteς which, however, is unattested (Steph. Byz. 73 . 12 ); instead we find the ktetikon Αasperλικός ( IG iv² . 1 122 . 69 (C4 )), which is attested in the plural form as well (Bacchyl. fr. 4 . 49 ; IG iv² . 1 122 . 80 : [ αasper πόλι ] ς αasper τῶν Αasperλικῶν ). Halieis is called a polis implicitly in the urban sense (Ps.-Skylax 50 ; cf. Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ) and explicitly in the political sense ( IG iv² . 1 122 . 74 , 80 (C4 )). The external use of the city-ethnic is attested both collectively ( IG i³ 75 . 6 -7 , 19 , 27 ( 424 / 3 ); IG iv² . 1 122 . 80 (C4 ); Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 , 7 . 2 . 2 ) and individually ( IG iv² . 1 121 . 120 (C4 ), 122 . 69 (C4 )). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic Tirynthioi is attested on C5 coins ( infra ). The territory is called γηtilde Αasperλιάς (Thuc. 2 . 56 . 5 , 4 . 45 . 2 ) and its area is estimated at 84 km ² (Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 18 ). The earliest community was probably Dryopian (Bacchyl. fr 4 . 49 ; Callim. fr. 705 , Pfeiffer; cf. Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 63 -65 ). Remains of a settlement at Halieis can be traced back to the Geometric period. The town flourished in the Archaic and Classical periods (Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 435 -37 ). It may have been a polis already in the Archaic period, but the absence of Halieis from the victory dedications at Olympia and Delphi (Paus. 5 . 23 . 1 -2 ; ML 27 ) indicates that, if it was a polis , it must have been a dependent polis , dominated by, probably, Hermion (no. 350 ) as may be inferred from Ephor. fr. 56 (cf. Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 75 ). In c. 460 Halieis must have been ceded by Hermion to the Tirynthians (no. 356 ) after they had been expelled from Tiryns by the Argives (Hdt. 6 . 83 . 1 -2 ; Strabo 8 . 6 . 11 -12 ; Paus. 2 . 25 . 8 ). They formed a community called Αasperλιεῖς οιasper εκ Τίρυνθος at Hdt. 7 . 137 . 2 , though on their coins they used their original city-ethnic: ΤΙΡΥΝΘΙΩΝ ( infra ). In 460 / 59 a battle between the Athenians and the Peloponnesians was fought at Halieis (Thuc. 1 . 105 ; IG i³ 1147 . 3 ); the territory of Halieis was repeatedly ravaged by the Athenians during the Peloponnesian War (Thuc. 2 . 56 . 5 , 4 . 45 . 2 (r 425 )), and in 425 / 4 the Halieis concluded an alliance with the Athenians in which they handed over a fortified port for the duration of the war ( IG i³ 75 = Staatsverträge 184 ). Halieis was a member of the Peloponnesian League (Diod. 11 . 78 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ) until after the battle of Leuktra in 371 . Halieis may have been among the poleis won over by Epameinondas in 369 (Diod 15 . 69 . 1 ; cf. Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 80 ). The only known source for the constitution of Halieis is a bronze plaque inscribed in the Argive alphabet with a public enactment of C5f, allegedly found at Hermion but now commonly assigned to Halieis ( IG iv 554 = SEG 11 315 = Nomima i 107 ; cf. Jameson ( 1974 ) 68 -69 ; contra Brandt ( 1992 )). A tentative date of c. 480 , suggested at LSAG 169 no. 20 , is probably too high. The document concerns the calling to account of officials in charge of the treasures of Athena and mentions an assembly ( haliaia ), a boule , and some magistrates ( synartyontes and tamiai ). The natural harbour of Halieis ( limen at Ps.-Skylax 50 ) was one of the best along the coast; the sea-ward approach stretched for 1 , 300 m and narrowed to less than 300 m. The town, today partly submerged, was situated on a small promontory dominating the southern bay of Porto-Cheli.A defence circuit connected the town with an acropolis on which there was a modest temple, perhaps to Athena (Jameson ( 1974 ) 73 -74 ). Halieis was fortified in C5 (cf. IG i³ 75 . 11 ( 425 / 4 )); the circuit was of mudbrick on conglomerate foundations with interval towers; fortification on the site can be traced back to at least C7 (Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 435 ); Lang ( 1996 ) 176 with refs.). The walls enclosed an area of 18 ha, of which some 15 ha were suitable for habitation in C4m. Assuming a population density of 250 per ha, the town may in C4m have had some 3 , 750 inhabitants (Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 551 ). The north-eastern quarter of the lower town was built on a grid plan from C6f (Rudolph ( 1984 )). Outside the walls were found remains of a Classical stadion (Romano ( 1993 ) 36 ), a stoa and a C7e temple to Apollo (Jameson ( 1974 ) 71 -72 ). In C4 , after the miraculous cure of a citizen by a snake from the Asklepieion in Epidauros, the polis of Halieis consulted the Delphic oracle and was instructed to build a temple with a statue of Asklepios ( IG iv² . 1 122 . 69 -82 ; cf. Edelstein and Edelstein ( 1945 ) 423 . 33 ). Excavations show that the town was abandoned in C3e at the latest (Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 436 -37 ), but an inscription still uses the city-ethnic Αasperλικός in Epidauros in 220 / 19 ( IG iv² . 1 42 . 10 -11 ). Fishermen may have used the site sporadically, as they had when the Tirynthians settled in Halieis in C5f (Baladié ( 1980 ) 267 ). Halieis struck bronze coins in C4 . Types: obv . head of bearded Herakles or head of Apollo laureate; rev . palm tree or club; legend: ΤΙ or ΤΙΡΥ or ΤΙΡΥΝΘΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 443 ; SNG Cop.Argolis 148 -55 )."
350,Hermion (Hermioneus),Argolis,37.25,23.15,1411,6534,"350 . Hermion (Hermioneus) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 25 , long. 23 . 15 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The epichoric form of the toponym is ' Ερ µ ιωgraveν , -όνος ηasper , attested both in inscriptions ( IG iv² . 1 102 . 107 , 204 , 228 (C4f)) and in literary sources (Hdt. 8 . 73 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 4 ; Polyb. 2 . 52 . 2 ). The Ionic form ' Ερ µ ιόνη , ηasper is mostly attested in literature (Hom. Il . 2 . 560 ; Aristocles in Anth. Pal. App . 4 . 45 (C3 ); Strabo 8 . 6 . 3 ; Paus. 2 . 32 . 7 ; but see also IG iv 619 . 5 (late?)). The city-ethnic is ' Ερ µ ιονευacuteς ( IG iv 683 = Hesperia 22 ( 1953 ) 148 -54 no. 1 = LSAG 182 . 8 (C5m); IG i³ 31 . 2 (C5m)).Hermion is called a polis in the urban sense (Ps.-Skylax 51 ) and is repeatedly listed under the heading of polis used in the political sense (Hdt. 8 . 42 . 1 , 43 . 1 , 49 .l; Thuc. 8 . 3 . 2 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins from C4m on ( infra ) and externally in inscriptions (ML 27 . 5 ( 479 ); Syll . ³ 32 = LSAG 182 . 7 (C5f); IG i³ 31 . 2 (C5 )) and in literature (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 4 ; Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ). The individual use is found internally in dedications to Demeter Chthonia ( Hesperia 22 ( 1953 ) 148 -54 nos. 1 -4 (C5 -C4 )) and externally in inscriptions ( CID ii 5 . i . 12 (C4f)) and in literature (Hdt. 7 . 6 . 3 (rC6m)). The name of the territory is ηasper ' Ερ µ ιονιgraveς γηtilde (Thuc. 2 . 56 . 5 ). It comprised the south-eastern part of Akte. Hermion bordered on Troizen (no. 357 ) to the north-east, on Epidauros (no. 348 ) to the north-west, and on Halieis (no. 349 ) to the south-west (Thuc. 2 . 56 . 5 ). The territory covered 276 km ² (Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 18 ). It also comprised the islands of Pityoussa (Spetses), Aristera (Spetsopoula), Aperopia (Dokos) and Hydrea (Hydra) (Paus. 2 . 34 . 8 -9 ). In C6s a group of Samian refugees bought the island of Hydra from Hermion for some money they had exacted from the Siphnians, whereupon they handed over the island in trust to the Troizenians (Hdt. 3 . 59 . 1 ). Prior to c. 460 , when the Tirynthians settled at Halieis, that site may have been controlled by Hermion (Ephor. fr. 56 ; Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 75 ). Hermion provided three triremes at Salamis in 480 (Hdt. 8 . 43 ) and 300 men at Plataiai in 479 (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 4 ). Assuming that there is no overlap between the two forces, Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 556 -59 estimate the military strength of Hermion at 900 men, and the total population at c. 5 , 000 minimum and 7 , 500 maximum. During the grain crisis in 330 -326 Hermion received 8 , 000 medimnoi from Kyrene (no. 1028 ) (Tod 196 . 40 ). A communal dedication at Delphi is attested by Syll . ³ 32 (C5f); cf. Jacquemin ( 1999 ) no. 314 . Hermion was a Dryopian community (Hdt. 8 . 43 , 78 . 2 ). It was a member of the Kalaurian amphictyony (Strabo 8 . 6 . 14 ; Tausend ( 1992 ) 12 -19 ) and of the Peloponnesian League (Thuc. 8 . 3 . 2 ). It fought on the Greek side in the Persian War (Hdt. 8 . 43 , 72 , 9 . 28 . 4 , 31 . 4 ), and is recorded on the Serpent Column in Delphi (ML 27 . 5 ) and in Olympia (Paus. 5 . 23 . 2 ). The importance of the cities on Akte for Athenian maritime interests resulted in an alliance between Hermion and Athens (no. 361 ), concluded either c. 450 ( IG i³ 31 = Staatsverträge 150 ) or c. 425 (Mattingly ( 1996 ) 34 -35 ). In 435 Hermion supported Corinth (no. 227 ) against Korkyra (no. 123 ) with one trireme (Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 ). During the Peloponnesian War the territory of Hermion was plundered by the Athenians (Thuc. 2 . 56 . 5 ). After the Athenian defeat at Syracuse,Hermion took an active part in the mobilisation of a Peloponnesian fleet (Thuc. 8 . 3 . 2 ), and after the battle of Aigos potamoi in 405 , a statue was set up in Delphi of the commander of the squadron from Hermion (Paus. 10 . 9 . 10 ). Hermion fought on the Spartan side in the battle of Nemea (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ) and remained loyal to Sparta (no. 345 ) even after the battle of Leuktra (Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 3 , 7 . 2 . 2 ). Hermion may have been among the poleis won over by Epameinondas in 369 (Diod 15 . 69 . 1 ; cf. Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 80 ). Alongside Sparta and other members of the Peloponnesian League,Hermion concluded an alliance with Athens in 370 / 69 (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 2 ; cf. Staatsverträge 274 ). Hermion joined the revolt against Makedonia after the death of Alexander the Great (Diod. 18 . 11 . 2 ). IG iv² . 1 102 B. ii . 203 ( 400 -350 ) records a payment to a κάρυκι . . . ες ' Ερ µ ιόνα . We have no information about the political institutions of Hermion, and there is no support in the sources for the view that the Aristotelian collection of politeiai included a constitution of the Hermionians ( pace Arist. iii p. 635 , Gigon). In Ps.-Skylax 51 Hermion is classified as a πόλις καιgrave λι µ ήν . The town lay on the Gulf of Hydra. In the Archaic and Classical periods it was situated at the tip of a headland between two well-protected natural harbours,but later,perhaps in C2 or C1 , it was moved c. 1 km westwards to the far end of the peninsula and to the lower slopes of Mt. Pron (Paus. 2 . 34 . 9 ; Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 584 -90 ). The older town was fortified with a defence circuit in trapezoidal masonry. Some stretches of the wall and the remains of a round tower can still be seen. The wall has tentatively been dated to C4 , perhaps C4l (Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 585 -86 ). The walls enclosed an area of 22 . 5 ha, of which some 8 . 5 ha were available for habitation in C6 , and almost 17 ha in C4 . Assuming a population density of 250 per ha, the town may in C4m have had some 4 , 200 inhabitants (ibid. 551 ). Paus. 2 . 34 . 10 records seven sanctuaries in the old town; that of Poseidon has been matched with the foundations of a temple of C6l (ibid. 589 -90 ). The most famous cult was that of Demeter Chthonia,for whom Lasos of Hermion composed a dithyramb (fr. 702 , PMG (C6s); Paus. 2 . 35 . 5 -8 ; Ael. NA 11 . 4 ). Hermion struck coins of silver and bronze from c. 350 . ( 1 ) Silver triobols and obols on the Aiginetan standard; types: obv . head of Demeter Chthonia wearing corn-wreath; rev . corn-wreath and, sometimes, torch(es); legend: ΕΡ . ( 2 ) Bronze: obv . head of Demeter Chthonia, sometimes facing; rev . torch and ΕΡ within corn-wreath (Head, HN ² 442 ; SNG Cop. Argolis 136 -44 ). The full form of the city-ethnic, ΕΡΜΙΟΝΕΩΝ , is attested on coins of the Roman period ( SNG Cop.Argolis 145 )."
351,Kleonai (Kleonaios),Argolis,37.5,22.45,844,4006,"351 . Kleonai (Kleonaios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 50 , long. 22 . 45 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: B. The toponym is Κλεωναί , αιasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 570 ; Thuc. 6 . 95 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 49 ; IG iv² . 1 103 . 69 (C4f)). The city-ethnic is Κλεωναῖος ( SEG 11 290 . 6 ( c. 560 ?) = ML 9 ; Pind. Nem . 10 . 42 ). Kleonai is attested as a polis in late sources only (Polyb. 2 . 52 . 1 , 2 ; Paus. 2 . 15 . 1 ), but its status as a polis in the Archaic and Classical periods is ensured by its mint, its control of the Nemean Games, its Panhellenic victors, and the proxeny decrees for Kleonaian citizens ( infra ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on C5 -C4 coins ( infra ) and externally on a C6f bronze plate from Olympia ( SEG 31 365 ) and in literary sources (Pind. Nem . 10 . 42 ; Thuc. 5 . 67 . 2 ). The individual use is attested internally in a C6m dedication ( SEG 11 290 . 6 ) and externally in two Athenian C4 proxeny decrees for citizens of Kleonai ( IG ii² 63 and 365 (on which latter, see infra )). Kleonai was squeezed in between Corinth (no. 227 ) and Argos (no. 347 ) (Paus. 2 . 15 . 1 -2 ; Strabo 8 . 6 . 19 ). Its territory covered some 135 km ² , and its total population has been assessed at c. 8 , 000 persons (Sakellariou and Faraklas ( 1971 ) 122 , 125 , 128 ). Hostile relations with Corinth (Plut. Cim . 17 . 1 -2 ) made Kleonai an ally of Argos, and the Kleonaians assisted the Argives when, in the 460 s, they conquered and destroyed Mykenai (no. 353 ) (Strabo 8 . 6 . 19 ; cf. Diod. 11 . 65 ). Some of the surviving Mykenaians settled in Kleonai (Paus. 7 . 25 . 6 ). During the Peloponnesian War Kleonai was still allied to Argos (Thuc. 5 . 67 . 2 , 72 . 4 , 74 . 3 ). A citizen of Kleonai was appointed proxenos by Athens prior to 378 / 7 ( IG ii² 63 ). If the restoration [ Κλεωναῖ ] ον in an Athenian proxeny decree of 323 / 2 ( IG ii² 365 ; cf. Piérart and Touchais ( 1996 ) 62 -64 ) is accepted, the inference is that Kleonai was still a polis in C4l (Piérart ( 1982 ) 129 ) and that is further confirmed by the bronze coins struck by Kleonai in C4l ( infra ). But at some point in C4l Kleonai was incorporated into Argos and became a civic subdivision of that polis ( SEG 30 355 (C4l); IG iv 616 ( c. 315 )). Remains of a polygonal acropolis fortification with interval towers and a defence circuit of the lower town (Scheer ( 1989 ) 332 ) may antedate the incorporation of Kleonai into Argos. The biennial Panhellenic games held in the sanctuary of Zeus in Nemea (on which see Hart ( 1977 )) were controlled byKleonai in C5f (Pind. Nem . 4 . 17 , 10 . 42 ); they had probably been organised by Kleonai from their foundation in 573 (Euseb. 101 b, Helm) and continued to be so until Kleonai was integrated into Argos in C4l. Citizens of Kleonai were victors in the Olympic Games in 732 and 456 ( Olympionikai 12 and 273 ) and in the Nemean Games in C6m ( SEG 11 290 = ML 9 ). Paus. 2 . 15 . 1 records a sanctuary of Athena, apparently of the Archaic period.A sanctuary of Herakles is mentioned at Diod. 4 . 33 . 3 . Remains found at Archaia Nemea have been tentatively identified with this sanctuary by Frickenhaus ( Karo ( 1913 ) 114 ). The sanctuary of Zeus in the valley of Nemea was excavated by S. Miller ( 1990 ), and in it was found a C4l list of theorodokoi for the Nemean Games, presumably drawn up by Argos when it took over control of the games c. 315 (Perlman ( 2000 ) 105 -55 ). Kleonai struck coins of silver on the Aiginetan standard c. 471 -421 and of bronze in C4l. ( 1 ) Silver (C5 ); types: obv . head of Herakles (obol), or lion's skin (hemiobol), or bunch of grapes (tetartemorion); rev . incuse square; legend: Κ . ( 2 ) Bronze (C4l); types: obv . head of Herakles; rev . parsley wreath; legend: ΚΛ or ΚΛΕ or ΚΛΕΩ (Babelon, Traité ii. 3 . 481 -84 ; SNG Cop. Argolis 111 -13 ). For the date of the bronze coins, see Miller ( 1976 ) 192 ). On later coins the cityethnic is spelled out: ΚΛΕΩΝΑΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 441 )."
352,Methana (Methanaios),Argolis,37.35,23.2,583,2874,"352 . Methana (Methanaios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 23 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A? The toponym is Μεθάνα , ηasper ( IG iv 853 . 20 (first century ad )), in the Ionic dialect Μεθάνη , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 46 ; cf. infra ) or Μεθώνη , ηasper (Thuc. 4 . 45 . 2 bis , but most editors emend the first occurrence and delete the second; see Maurer ( 1995 ) 75 ) or Μέθανα , τά (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 7 ; Strabo 8 . 6 . 15 ; Paus. 2 . 34 . 1 , 3 -4 ). The city-ethnic is Μεθαναῖος , attested in the full form exclusively on coins of the Roman period, in abbreviated form on C4l/C3e coins (infra). Methana is called a polis in the urban sense (Ps.Skylax 46 ), provided that Müller ad loc . is right in supposing that Μεθάνα πόλις καιgrave λι µ ήν is misplaced from the Argolic section and erroneously listed among the Lakedaimonian perioikic poleis (Shipley ( 1997 ) 226 ). The territory of Methana was the volcanic peninsula on the south coast of the Saronic Gulf. The last attested eruption of the volcano was in C3f (Strabo 1 . 3 . 18 ; Paus. 2 . 34 . 1 ; cf. Baladié ( 1980 ) 158 -63 ). The peninsula is separated from the continent by an isthmus 1 , 200 m long and 300 m wide.It was an ideal military base, and in 425 the Athenians (no. 361 ) occupied Methana and built a wall across the isthmus (Thuc. 4 . 45 . 2 ). The Peace of Nikias stipulated the restitution of the peninsula to the Lakedaimonians (no. 345 ) (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 7 ). In C5 and probably C4Methana was under Troizenian domination (Thuc. 4 . 118 . 4 ; cf. HCTad loc .; Paus. 2 . 34 . 1 ). The classification of Methana as a polis in Ps.-Skylax (if correctly interpreted supra ) and the C4 coins ( infra ) indicate that Methana was a dependent polis (Mee and Forbes ( 1997 ) 68 -69 ). In the Heltic period Methana was controlled by the Ptolemaic kings (Robert ( 1960 ) 156 -60 ) and renamed Αρσινόη ηasper εν Πελοποννήσωι ( OGIS 102 ; SNG Cop.Argolis 147 ). The town was on the west coast of the peninsula; it covered an area of c. 5 ha in the Archaic and c. 8 ha in the Classical period. The acropolis was protected by a defence circuit partly in trapezoidal irregular and partly in isodomic ashlar masonry with square towers; it covered an area of c. 1 ha.The probable date is C4s. Apart from the urban centre there were two large second-order settlements on the eastern side of the peninsula, one at Oga ( c. 6 ha) and one at Magoula ( c. 2 ha), neither of them recorded in Barr . Furthermore, the peninsula is dotted with smaller sites, some of which can be interpreted as farmsteads and some as small hamlets. The number of sites reached its peak in C5l, and there were considerably fewer sites in C4 (Mee and Forbes ( 1997 ) 57 -69 ). Methana struck bronze coins in C4l and C3e: obv . head of Hephaistos in conical pilos ; rev . ΜΕ or ΜΕΘ in cornwreath (Gill ( 1997 ) 278 -79 ; SNG Cop.Argolis 146 )."
353,Mykenai (Mykenaios),Argolis,37.45,22.45,706,3238,"353 . Mykenai (Mykenaios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 45 , long. 22 . 45 . Size of territory: 2 ? Type: A. The Doric form of the toponym is Μυκάνα , αasper (IG iv 498 . 11 ; cf. Mitsos ( 1949 ) 74 ) or, in the plural, Μυκάναι , αιasper (Pind. Pyth . 4 . 49 ). In the Ionic dialect the toponym is Μυκήνη (Hom. Il . 4 . 52 , 7 . 180 , 11 . 46 ); in later literature, however, the preferred form is Μυκηtildeναι in the plural (Pind. Pyth . 4 . 49 ; Eur. Heracl . 85 ; Thuc. 1 . 10 . 1 ; Diod. 11 . 65 . 5 ; Strabo 8 . 6 . 10 ), first attested in the Catalogue of Ships (Hom. Il . 569 ). The Doric form of the city-ethnic is Μυκανευacuteς (ML 27 . 7 ( 479 ); IG iv 497 (C2e)); in literature it is Μυκηναῖος (Hom. Il . 15 . 638 ; Hdt. 7 . 202 ; Eur. Heracl . 187 ; Thuc. 1 . 9 . 2 ). The collective and external use of the cityethnic is attested in inscriptions (ML 27 . 7 ) and in literature (Hdt. 7 . 202 ). The individual use of the adverbial equivalent is attested internally ( IG iv 492 . 1 -2 : Φρα h ιαρίδας Μυκανέαθεν ; cf. SEG 40 334 (C5e)). Mykenai is referred to as being a polis in a bronze plaque of C5e ( IG iv 492 . 3 , cf. SEG 40 334 : παρ ' Αθαναίας ες πόλιος ικέτας έγεντο ), where polis is used either in the sense of acropolis (Lambrinoudakis ( 1990 ) 180 ) or in the urban sense (Marcadé apud Lambrinoudakis ( 1990 ) 183 -85 ). Mykenai is not called a polis in any other Archaic or Classical source, but retrospectively by Diod. 11 . 65 . 5 (r 468 ) and Paus. 5 . 23 . 3 (r 480 ). Polis status in the political sense is strongly indicated by the role Mykenai played in the Persian War. At Hdt. 7 . 202 . 1 and 204 . 1 the Mykenaians are listed among the poleis that defended Thermopylai, and they are mentioned on the Serpent Column in Delphi (ML 27 . 7 ). There is no clue to the problem of whether Mykenai was a dependent polis in the Archaic period (Piérart ( 1997 )). In the Heltic period Mykenai was a kome of Argos (no. 347 ) ( IG iv 498 . 2 (C3 -C2 )). After the battle of Sepeia, Mykenai dissociated itself from Argos. It provided 80 men at Thermopylai in 480 (Hdt. 7 . 202 ) and, together with Tiryns (no. 356 ), 400 men at Plataiai in 479 (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 4 ). As a result, Mykenai is recorded on the Serpent Column in Delphi (ML 27 . 7 ) and in Olympia (Paus. 5 . 23 . 2 : Αργείων οιasper Μυκήνας έχοντες ). During this period Mykenai may have been in charge of the Argive Heraion (Kritzas ( 1992 ) 232 ). In c. 460 , taking advantage of the weakness of Sparta after the earthquake in 464 , the Argives and their allies besieged the Mykenaians,who found refuge behind their Cyclopean walls (Diod. 11 . 65 . 3 ; Paus. 7 . 25 . 5 -6 ). Mykenai was starved into surrender and exposed to an andrapodismos (Diod. 11 . 65 . 5 ) whereby the surviving Mykenaians were transferred, some to Kleonai (no. 351 ), some to Keryneia (no. 236 ), and some to Makedonia (Paus. 7 . 25 . 6 ). The city itself was demolished and its territory divided among Argos, Kleonai and Tenea (Diod. 11 . 65 . 2 -5 ; Paus. 2 . 16 . 5 , 5 . 23 . 3 , 8 . 27 . 1 ; Strabo 8 . 6 . 19 , where Τενεατῶν is a convincing emendation of MS Τεγεατῶν ; cf. Piérart ( 1992 ) 377 -82 ). The walls were probably dismantled on this occasion (Boethius ( 1921 -23 ) 415 )."
354,Orneai (Orneates),Argolis,37.45,22.35,688,3329,"354 . Orneai (Orneates) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 45 , long. 22 . 35 . Size of territory: 1 -2 . Type: C. The toponym is ' Ορνεαί , αιasper (Ar. Av . 399 ; Thuc. 6 . 7 . 1 -2 ) or ' Ορνειαί (Hom. Il . 2 . 571 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ορνεάτης (Thuc. 5 . 67 . 2 ; Plut. Mor . 401 D, quoting a dedication of C4l), in Ionic ' Ορνεήτης (Hdt. 8 . 73 . 3 ). The collective and external use is the only one attested in the sources (e.g. Hdt. 8 . 73 . 3 ; Thuc. 5 . 67 . 2 ). The only source in which Orneai is called a polis (in the urban sense) is Diod. 16 . 34 . 3 (r 353 / 2 ) and 39 . 4 (r 352 / 1 : επιgrave πόλιν ' Ορνεαgraveς τηtildeς Αργείας ). Paus. 8 . 27 . 1 (rC5 ) calls Orneai a polisma , but, referring to his own time, Strabo classifies Orneai as a kome ( 8 . 6 . 17 ; cf. Steph. Byz. 496 . 1 ). If Diodorus' classification of Orneai as a polis can be trusted, it must have been a dependent polis lying in Argive territory. Orneai's status as an ally of Argos (no. 347 ) (Thuc. 5 . 67 . 2 ) as well as the use of the collective city-ethnic in a C4l communal dedication set up in Delphi (Jacquemin ( 1999 ) no. 381 , see infra ) support the information obtained from Diodorus that Orneai was still a political community and not just an Argive municipality. Pausanias ( 8 . 27 . 1 ) cites the Argive synoecism of Tiryns (no. 356 ), Hysiai, Orneai (no. 354 ), Mykenai (no. 353 ) and Mideia as a model for the synoecism of Megalopolis (no. 282 ) decided in 371 / 70 and carried out in 368 . The Argive subjection of the other cities in Argolis, however, was a protracted process, not a proper synoecism, and Pausanias' information about Orneai is in conflict with other sources testifying to the polis status of Orneai in C4 (Demand ( 1990 ) 59 -60 ; Piérart ( 1997 ) 334 -38 ). After the battle of Mantinea in 418 , Orneai and Kleonai (no. 351 ) are described by Thucydides as being allies of Argos (Thuc. 5 . 67 . 2 , 72 . 4 , 74 . 3 ). In 416 / 15 a Lakedaimonian army invaded the territory of Argos. The Lakedaimonians conquered Orneai, fortified the place, settled it with exiled Argives, and left a garrison when they withdrew. But assisted by an Athenian expeditionary force, the Argive army attacked Orneai, chased the settlers away and demolished their settlement (Thuc. 6 . 7 . 1 -2 ; Diod. 12 . 81 . 4 -5 ). According to Paus. 2 . 25 . 6 , the inhabitants were transferred to Argos (Moggi, Sin . 210 -13 ). Subsequently, Orneai was resettled, and in 353 / 2 the Lakedaimonians defeated an Argive army in a battle near Orneai and conquered the town after a short siege (Diod. 16 . 34 . 3 and 39 . 4 , where the same story is told once again, but in reverse order: at 39 . 4 the conquest of Orneai precedes the battle). According to Diod. 16 . 39 . 4 , the Lakedaimonians attacked Orneai because it was allied with Megalopolis (no. 282 ). In, probably, C4l the Orneatai defeated a Sikyonian invasion army and had their victory commemorated by a communal dedication in Delphi (Jacquemin ( 1999 ) no. 381 ; Paus. 10 . 18 . 5 ; Plut. Mor . 401 D: ' Ορνεαtildeται αποgrave Σικυωνίων ). Orneai has been located at Palaiokastraki, i.e. modern Lirkia (Paus. 2 . 25 . 5 ). Remains of a defence circuit in polygonal masonry are still visible; it is undated but perhaps of C4s (Pritchett ( 1980 ) 25 -27 ; Pikoulas ( 1995 ) 267 -70 )."
355,Phleious (Phleiasios),Argolis,37.5,22.4,2213,10233,"355 . Phleious (Phleiasios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 50 , long. 22 . 40 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: A. The toponym is Φλειουtildeς , -ντος , οasper (Simon. 9 . 4 , Maehler; Hdt. 7 . 202 ; Thuc. 5 . 58 . 1 ); the adverbial form ΦλειΓaltόνταθεν is attested in a C5f dedication from Olympia ( SEG 11 1212 ). The city-ethnic is Φλειάσιος (Hdt. 8 . 72 ; CID ii 31 . 78 (C4m)),or occasionally Φλειήσιος ( CID ii 4 . i . 49 -53 (C4f)), in late sources often Φλιάσιος (Diod. 11 . 32 . 1 ). The epichoric form is [ Φλει ] Γaltάσιος ( SEG 26 415 ( c. 500 )). Phleious is called a polis both in the urban sense (Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 15 ) and in the political sense (Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 10 -12 ; IG iv² . 1 620 (C4 -C3 ), where [ αasper πόλι ] ς αasper τῶν Φλειασ [ ίων ] is a plausible restoration). Phleious is called an asty at Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 6 and 15 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C5 coins ( infra ) and externally in inscriptions (ML 27 . 5 ( 479 ); IG ii² 112 . 3 ( 362 / 1 ); CID ii 10 . i . 16 ( 357 / 6 )) and in literature (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 4 ; Thuc. 4 . 70 . 1 ; Pl. Phd . 57 A).The individual and internal use is found in SEG 29415 ( c. 500 ), and the external use is found in IG iv² . 1 69 = SEG 11 400 . 5 (C4f)) and in Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 1 . The name of the territory was ηasper Φλειασία (Thuc. 5 . 83 . 3 , 115 . 1 , 6 . 105 . 3 ) or Φλειουtildeς (Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 15 ). It covered c. 135 km ² of fertile plain (Meyer ( 1941 ) 272 ) along the upper reach of the river Asopos. The valley is ringed by mountains and it bordered to the south on Argos (no. 347 ) and Orneai (no. 354 ) (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 1 ), to the east on Kleonai (no. 351 ) and the plain of Nemea (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 5 ), to the north on Sikyon (no. 228 ) (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 1 ) and to the west on Arkadia (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 10 ). The roads through its territory gave access to the other regions of the Peloponnese, and its strategic importance is reflected in the sources. Phleious provided 200 men at Thermopylai in 480 (Hdt. 7 . 202 ), 1 , 000 men at Plataiai in 479 (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 4 ), and 400 men to Brasidas' expedition in 424 (Thuc. 4 . 70 . 1 ). At Hell . 5 . 3 . 16 Xenophon quotes the Lakedaimonians for the statement that Phleious had 5 , 000 adult male citizens, probably an exaggerated figure ( = a total population of 20 , 000 minimum,with 150 persons per km ² !) and hardly compati- ble with Prokles of Phleious' concession that Phleious was one of the small poleis (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 44 ). On the other hand, if Xenophon is right that more than 1 , 000 pro-Spartan Phleiasians were in exile in 381 ( Hell . 5 . 3 . 17 ), Phleious must have been among the most populous Peloponnesian poleis . Phleious fought on the Greek side in the Persian War (Hdt. 7 . 202 , 8 . 72 , 9 . 28 . 4 ), and is recorded on the Serpent Column in Delphi (ML 27 . 5 ) and in Olympia (Paus. 5 . 23 . 2 ). It was a member of the Peloponnesian League (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 8 ). Having Argos (no. 347 ) as its arch-enemy and being involved in numerous wars with the Argives, Phleious usually sided with Sparta (no. 345 ) and the members of the Peloponnesian League. Thus, in 435 the Phleiasians supported Corinth (no. 227 ) against Korkyra (no. 127 ) (Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 ); 400 men joined Brasidas in 424 (Thuc. 4 . 70 . 1 ); and in 418 , when Agis attacked Argos, the invasion army rallied at Phleious (Thuc. 5 . 57 ). After the oligarchic coup d'état in Argos in 417 , Phleious sheltered the exiled Argives (Thuc. 5 . 83 . 3 ) and was subsequently exposed to several Argive incursions into its territory (Thuc. 5 . 83 . 3 , 115 . 1 , 6 . 105 . 3 ). At the beginning of the Corinthian War Phleious remained neutral (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ), but numerous raids by Iphikrates' mercenaries forced the Phleiasians to ask for and admit a Spartan garrison (Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 15 , 5 . 3 . 15 ). The government imposed by the Spartans ( infra ) remained loyal to Sparta after Leuktra (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 2 ). Together with Sparta the Phleiasians approached the Athenians in 369 (Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 1 ; Staatsverträge 274 ), and in 362 / 1 they concluded an alliance with the Athenians ( IG ii² 112 ; Staatsverträge 290 ). Phleious joined the Greek revolt against Makedonia after the death of Alexander the Great (Paus. 1 . 25 . 4 ). Phleiasian citizens received grants of proxeny from Athens (no. 361 ) ( IG i³ 80 . 14 -16 ( 421 / 20 )) and from Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( SEG 11 400 ( 375 -350 )). Phleious granted proxeny to a citizen of Pellene (no. 240 ) and released him without ransom when he was taken prisoner (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 16 ). The Phleiasians sheltered the Argive priestess of Hera who fled Argos after having set the temple on fire (Thuc. 4 . 133 . 3 ). Information about diplomatic activities is sparse, but we hear about Phleiasian envoys to Sparta (Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 14 , 24 ) and Athens (Xen. Hell . 7 . 1 . 1 ). Several Phleiasians served as naopoioi in Delphi ( CID ii 74 . 77 ( 337 / 6 ), 75 . ii . 50 ( 336 / 5 )). In 498 Timainetos of Phleious won the hoplite race in Nemea (Paus. 10 . 7 . 7 ), and another Nemean victor is celebrated by Bacchyl. 9 , Maehler. The only information we have about the constitution of ## pirart Phleious in the Archaic period is the tradition that in C6 the city was ruled by a tyrant called Leon, allegedly a friend of Pythagoras (Diog. Laert. 1 . 12 , 8 . 8 ). There is no foundation for Gigon's view that the Aristotelian collection of politeiai included a constitution of Phleious (Arist. no. 142 ). In C4e Phleious seems to have been a democracy with ekklesiai attended by all citizens (Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 16 ; cf. ψηφισά µ ενοι at 5 . 3 . 21 ). In 395 some pro-Spartan citizens were exiled and had their property confiscated (Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 15 , 5 . 2 . 10 ). With Spartan support they were repatriated in 384 (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 9 ), but in 381 they appealed to Sparta once again because they could not recover the property confiscated in 395 . A Lakedaimonian army under Agesilaos invaded Phleious and laid siege to the city assisted by more than 1 , 000 exiled Phleiasians whom he had trained and organised into syssitia (Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 10 -17 ). The Phleiasians endured a siege of 20 months but were starved into surrender in 379 . The judicial purge after the conquest was carried out by a commission of 100 men ( 50 of the exiles and 50 of the besieged); Agesilaos imposed a new constitution, presumably an oligarchy, and left a garrison in Phleious (Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 21 -25 ; Isoc. 4 . 126 ; Diod. 15 . 19 . 3 ; cf. Gehrke, Stasis 127 -31 ). A number of the besieged Phleiasians went into exile (Diod. 15 . 40 . 5 ; Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 5 ) but took possession of two strongholds in Phleiasian territory: with Sikyonian support they held Thyamia, and with Argive support they held Trikaranon (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 1 , 7 . 4 . 1 , 11 ), from where they attacked Phleious in 374 (Diod. 15 . 40 . 5 ; Roy ( 1973 ); Stylianou ( 1998 ) 330 -31 ) or perhaps in 370 (Buckler ( 1980 ) 292 n. 1 ). In 367 / 6 , with the support of an army from Arkadia and Elis (no. 251 ), the exiles organised a major nocturnal attack on Phleious, which failed (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 5 -9 ), as did later attacks launched first by the Argives and the Arkadians and later by the Sikyonians (no. 228 ) and Pellenians (no. 240 ) (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 10 -15 ). The only known public act is a sacred law, perhaps of C6f ( IG iv 439 = LSAG 150 n. 1 ). A decree found on Delos was attributed to Phleious by Robert ( 1948 ) 5 -15 , but to Corinth (no. 227 ) by Jones ( 1980 ). The town of Phleious lay on a ridge rising to c. 60 m above the plain. On the top of the ridge was a citadel called akra (Xen. Hell . 4 . 4 . 15 ) or akropolis (Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 15 ); it was mostly uninhabited and used for growing grain (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 8 ). Anurban survey of the town indicates that it covered an area of c. 60 ha (Alcock ( 1991 ) 428 fig. 3 ). The town was fortified with a defence circuit, c. 4 km long,probably of mudbrick on a stone socle in ashlar masonry and with interval towers. Some stretches of the stone socle can still be seen in the foundations of the 'Corinthian Gate' (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 11 ) in the north-east corner of the wall. The acropolis was separately fortified. The wall has tentatively been dated to C4e (Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 7 -8 ; Alcock ( 1991 ) 435 -37 ). An agora has been identified at the western end of the acropolis ridge (Alcock ( 1991 ) 432 ). Of the monumental buildings only two antedate the Heltic period: the 'Hypostyle Hall' tentatively dated to the Archaic period (Blegen ( 1925 ) 30 -31 ; Biers ( 1971 ) 445 ), and the 'Palati' , a rectangular 'basilica' ( c. 34 × 26 m) with a courtyard surrounded by columns and open to the sky, probably of C5s. It may have had rows of seats arranged to look out on the central courtyard,and it may have been used as a bouleuterion and/or a dikasterion (Biers ( 1971 ), ( 1973 )). A πολε µ άρχειος στοά of c. 500 is attested in literary sources (Ath. 210 B; cf. Roux ( 1958 ) 161 -70 ). A theatre north of the Hypostyle Hall may go back to C4 ( TGR ii. 117 ). The principal cult was that of Ganymede (Hebe), whose sanctuary on the acropolis is known exclusively from Paus. 2 . 13 . 3 -4 . An extra-urban sanctuary of Hera is mentioned by Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 1 , 6 , 11 -13 . Phleious may have struck silver staters on the Euboic standard in C6 , and undoubtedly struck coins of silver and bronze on the Aiginetan standard from c. 431 to c. 322 .

356,Tiryns (Tirynthios),Argolis,37.35,22.5,824,4175,"356 . Tiryns (Tirynthios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 22 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 ? Type: B. The toponym is Τίρυνς -νθος , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 559 ; Hdt. 6 . 77 . 1 , 83 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 49 ). A variant form, Τίρυνθος , is found in [Hes]. Sc . 81 . The city-ethnic is Τιρυacuteνθιος (ML 27 . 6 ( 479 ); Hdt. 9 . 28 . 4 , 31 . 3 ); these examples testify to the collective and external use of the city-ethnic. For the external and individual use, see P Oxy . 222 . i . 42 (r 468 ). Apart from Pind. Ol . 10 . 68 , where Tiryns is called a polis in a mythological context, Tiryns is classified as a polis in late sources only (Mosch. Megara 38 ; Paus. 2 . 25 . 8 ; Steph. Byz. 625 . 17 ); asty is found at Bacchyl. 10 . 57 , Maehler, but again in a mythological context. Polis status in the Archaic and early Classical periods, however, is strongly indicated by the sacred laws of c. 600 ( SEG 30 380 ; see infra ) and by Tiryns' participation in the Persian War on a par with communities which were all poleis (ML 27 . 6 ). In the Archaic period Tiryns was probably a polis dependent on Argos (no. 347 ) (Piérart ( 1997 ) 335 -36 ). After the battle of Sepeia, however, Tiryns was freed from Argive supremacy and, together with Mykenai (no. 353 ), it provided 400 men at Plataiai in 479 (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 4 ) and is recorded on the Serpent Column in Delphi (ML 27 . 6 ) and in Olympia (Paus. 5 . 23 . 2 : εκ δεgrave χώρας τηtildeς Αργείας Τιρυacuteνθιοι ). In Olympia in 468 a Tirynthian was the winning pugilist in the boys' category ( Olympionikai 244 ; P Oxy . 222 . i . 42 ). Shortly afterwards Tiryns was taken over by Argive slaves ( douloi ; cf. supra 605 ) expelled from Argos by the sons of those who fell at Sepeia; after some years of peaceful relations, war broke out between Argos and the former slaves in Tiryns, who eventually were defeated by the Argives (Hdt. 6 . 83 . 1 -2 ). They found refuge in Epidauros (no. 348 ) and Hermion (no. 350 ), and settled Halieis (no. 349 ) (Hdt. 7 . 137 . 2 ; Strabo 8 . 6 . 11 ). Some of the inhabitants may have been incorporated into the population of Argos (no. 347 ) (Paus. 8 . 27 . 1 ). Tiryns was demolished, and part of the booty won by the Argives on this occasion could still be seen by Pausanias in the Argive Heraion and in the temple of Apollo Lykeios ( 2 . 17 . 5 , 8 . 46 . 3 ). The sacred laws of c. 600 , inscribed in 'serpentine' style, are the oldest known documents in which haliaia and demos are juxtaposed ( SEG 30 380 , 1 -4 , 8 -9 : αλιιαίια , δαtilde µ ος ); and magistrates mentioned repeatedly in the laws are the hieromnamones and the plativoinarchos ( SEG 30 380 = Nomima i 78 : ιasperαρο µ νά µ ονες , πλατιΓaltοίναρχος ). In Pausanias' day only ruins were left of Tiryns, but the acropolis, called Likymna, with its Cyclopean walls was still impressive (Paus. 2 . 25 . 8 , 9 . 36 . 5 ). The Archaic temple on the top of the acropolis has been attributed sometimes to Hera (Frickenhaus ( 1912 )), sometimes to Athena (Foley ( 1988 ) 145 -47 ). An Archaic sanctuary of Herakles is attested in the serpentine inscriptions ( SEG 30 380 n. 15 ). Further C6 architectural spolia from the acropolis include the probable remains of a propylon or stoa (Schwandner ( 1988 )). So far no remains of an Archaic settlement have been found on the plain below the acropolis. Evidence of a substantial post-Mycenaean settlement on the 'Unterburg' is well documented,and although occasional sections of postGeometric walls have been found, along with a couple of C7 graves on the surrounding plain, the location of the related settlement(s) has yet to be securely established. This has tempted some historians to see Tiryns as a polis without an urban centre (Koerner ( 1985 )). It would, however, be most unwise, given the very limited extent of excavation on the surrounding plain, to draw negative conclusions about an absence of related settlement. The location of graves and settlement traces throughout the Early Iron Age (from LH iii C onwards) suggests that the inhabitants of Tiryns lived in settlements clustered on the plain immediately surrounding the acropolis (Morgan and Coulton ( 1997 ) 93 )."
357,Troizen (Troizenios),Argolis,37.3,23.25,1987,9125,"357 . Troizen (Troizenios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 30 , long. 23 . 25 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The epichoric form of the toponym is Τροζάν , -αtildeνος , ηasper ( IG iv 748 . 3 (C4f)). The Ionic form Τροιζήν , -ηtildeνος , ηasper is found in most of the literary sources (Hom. Il . 2 . 561 ; Hdt. 8 . 41 . 1 ; Thuc. 1 . 115 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 3 ) and in inscriptions (ML 23 . 8 ; Michel 452 . 1 (C4l); IG iv 798 . 2 (Imp.)); variant forms are Τροζήν (Andoc. 3 . 3 ) and Τρυζήν ( IG iv 619 . 4 (late?)). Ps.-Skylax 52 , 54 uses the toponym Τροιζηνία , ηasper . The Doric form of the city-ethnic is Τροζάνιος (ML 27 . 5 , 95 h; IG iv² . 1 122 . 10 (C4 ); IG iv 748 . 6 (C4f)); the Ionic form is Τροιζήνιος (Hdt. 3 . 59 . 1 ; Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ); mixed forms are Τροζήνιος (Dem. Ep . 2 . 19 ; IG ii² 1425 . 227 (C4f)), Τροιζάνιος ( SEG 9 2 . 43 (C4l); IG iv 727 A. 2 (C3 )) and Τροιζείνιος in a C3l Boiotian proxeny decree ( SEG 23 286 . 2 ). Troizen is called a polis in the urban sense (Dem. Ep . 2 . 18 ; Ps.-Skylax 52 ), in the political sense (Arist. Pol . 1335 a 15 , 20 ; Hyp. 5 . 32 ; Michel 452 . 6 (C4l)) and in the territorial sense (Hyp. 5 . 31 ). In the C4f accounts of the Delphic naopoioi the Troizenioi are recorded as contributors ( CID ii 4 . i . 9 ) under the heading ταίδε ταtilde µ πολίων ήνικαν ( CID ii 4 . i . 3 -4 ), where polis is used in the political sense (cf. also Diod. 12 . 78 . 2 (r 419 / 18 ) and IG iv 750 . 12 = Bielman ( 1994 ) 19 (C3e)). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a citizenship decree of 369 (?): οasper δαtilde µ ος οasper Τροζανίων ( IG iv 748 . 6 , 17 -18 = Syll . ³ 162 ) and externally on the Serpent Column in Delphi (ML 27 . 5 ( 479 )) and in Hdt. 3 . 59 . 1 ; Thuc. 8 . 3 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 . The individual and external use is attested in the thank-offering for the victory at Aigos potamoi ( Απολλόδωρος Καλλιφῶνος Τροζάνιος : ML 95 ; Paus. 10 . 9 . 10 (r 405 / 4 )). The name of the territory is Τροιζενία (Thuc. 5 . 45 . 2 ) or γηtilde Τροιζηνίς (Thuc. 2 . 65 . 5 ); χώρα is found at IG iv 748 . 4 . It covered 354 km ² and included the west coast of the Saronic Gulf from Methana (no. 352 ) to Cape Skyllaion (Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 18 ). After the death of Alexander the Great,Troizen lost the island of Kalauria (no. 360 ), which then became an independent polis . Troizen provided five triremes at Salamis in 480 (Hdt. 8 . 43 ), and 1 , 000 men at Plataiai in 479 (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 4 ). Assuming that there is no overlap between the two forces, Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 556 -59 estimate the military strength of Troizen at 2 , 000 men, and the total population at c. 11 , 500 minimum and 16 , 500 maximum. During the grain crisis in 330 -326 Troizen received 6 , 000 medimnoi from Kyrene (no. 1028 ) (Tod 196 . 45 ). IG iv² . 1 102 B. ii . 203 ( 400 -350 ) records a payment to a κάρυκι . . . ες Τροζάνα . Troizen presided over the Kalaurian amphiktyony (Strabo 8 . 6 . 14 ; Tausend ( 1992 ) 12 -19 ) and was a member of the Peloponnesian League (Diod. 12 . 78 . 2 (r 420 )). It fought on the Greek side in the Persian War (Hdt. 8 . 1 . 2 , 43 , 9 . 28 . 4 , 102 . 3 , 105 ), and is recorded on the Serpent Column in Delphi (ML 27 . 5 ) and in Olympia (Paus. 5 . 23 . 2 ). During the Persian occupation of Attika the Athenians' wives and children found refuge in Troizen (Hdt. 8 . 41 . 1 ; Plut. Them . 10 . 5 ; ML 23 . 8 , a C3 copy found in Troizen of a C4m text, quoted by Aischines in 348 (Dem. 19 . 303 )). It was occupied by the Athenians in 460 / 59 , but these had to surrender the city again in the peace of 446 / 5 (Thuc. 1 . 115 . 1 , 4 . 21 . 3 ). In 435 the Troizenians supported Corinth (no. 227 ) against Korkyra (no. 123 ) with two triremes (Thuc. 1 . 27 . 2 ). In 425 the Athenians occupied and fortified Methana (no. 352 ) and used it as a base for raids against the neighbouring commmunities. After the Athenian defeat at Syracuse, Troizen took an active part in the mobilisation of a Peloponnesian fleet (Thuc. 8 . 3 . 2 ) and in the naval operations (ML 95 ( 405 )). Troizen fought on the Spartan side in the battle of Nemea (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 16 ) and remained loyal to the Spartans even after the battle of Leuktra (Xen. Hell . 6 . 2 . 3 , 7 . 2 . 2 ). In 369 (?) Epaminondas ravaged the territory of Troizen but failed to conquer the city (Diod. 15 . 69 . 1 ). Alongside Sparta and other members of the Peloponnesian League, Troizen concluded an alliance with Athens in 370 / 69 ( IG iv 748 ( 369 ); IG ii² 1425 . 227 , 230 ( 368 / 7 ); Xen. Hell . 7 . 2 . 2 ; cf. Staatsverträge 274 ). After the Greek defeat at Chaironeia,a pro-Makedonian faction came to control Troizen (Hyp. 5 . 31 ; Lycurg. 1 . 42 ; cf. Whitehead ( 2000 ) 340 ), possibly as the result of a stasis , since a number of citizens were sent into exile and at least some of them obtained citizen rights in Athens (Hyp. 3 . 31 ; Osborne ( 1983 ) T 72 ). In 325 Demosthenes found refuge in Troizen (Dem. Ep . 2 . 18 -19 ; Plut. Dem . 26 . 5 ), and after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 , Troizen joined the revolt against Makedonia (Diod. 18 . 11 . 2 ; Paus. 1 . 23 . 3 -5 ). The Aristotelian collection of politeiai included a constitution of the Troizenians (Arist. frr. 613 -15 ). The only preserved psephisma of the Classical period is a citizenship decree proposed by a named citizen and passed by the boule and the demos ( IG iv 748 = Syll . ³ 162 ( 369 ?)), apparently in accordance with a probouleumatic procedure (Rhodes, DGS 77 -78 ). Another citizenship decree is referred to at Hyp. 5 . 31 . A decree of C4l or C3e records the name of the proposer and of the prostates of the boule , and refers to a board of damiourgoi (Wilhelm ( 1974 ) i. 38 ). A C4 dedication of fourteen named damiourgoi and prytaneis ( δα µ ιοργοιgrave καιgrave πρυτάνιες ) is consecrated to ταtildeι ηasperρώσσαι , i.e. Phaedra ( IG iv 764 ). Public enactments were set up in the sanctuary of Apollo Thearios ( IG iv 748 . 15 -16 ). The citizens were organised into phylai ( IG iv 748 ), of which there were at least three and presumably four. Of the three Dorian tribes, the Hylleis are attested ( IG iv 750 . 8 (C3e)); the existence of the Dymanes is indicated at Steph. Byz. 74 . 8 , and it is then a fair guess that the Pamphyloi were to be found in Troizen too. The Scheliadai ( Σχελιάδας : IG iv 748 . 24 ) constituted another phyle , which, pace Jones, POAG 111 , cannot have contained all the non-Dorian citizens, since sortition conducted by a magistrate called δεκαδευacuteς was used when a naturalised citizen was assigned to a phyle ( IG iv 748 . 20 -22 ). In c. 390 exiles from Siphnos (no. 519 ) found refuge in Troizen (Isoc. 19 . 23 ). Two Troizenians are attested as Athenian metics in C4s ( IG ii² 1673 = SEG 34 122 . 57 -58 ). In C4l a citizen of Troizen was appointed proxenos by Megara (no. 225 ) ( IG vii 7 ; cf. Rhodes, DGS 111 ). Baukis of Troizen is attested as victor in the Olympic Games in 400 ( Olympionikai 358 ), and in C6s Damotimos of Troizen won a race in Thebes ( IG iv 801 = LSAG 181 . 2 ). The calendar was of the Doric type, to judge from the months attested in Troizen: viz . Geraistios (Ath. 639 C; cf. Trümpy, Monat . 199 ), Artemitios ( IG iv 840 . 9 (C3 )) and Apellaios (Wilhelm ( 1908 ) 73 (C3 ?)). The urban centre was situated below Mt. Aderes and dominated a coastal plain c. 2 km wide along the Gulf of Poros. The town had an acropolis with a sanctuary of Athena Sthenias (Paus. 2 . 32 . 5 ). In C6m a temple was built on the slopes of the acropolis (Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 72 ), which Welter ( 1941 ) 20 tentatively identified as that of Aphrodite Akraia (Paus. 2 . 32 . 6 ). The agora was situated in the upper part of the habitation area, and the temple of Apollo Thearios in the agora was the oldest of all temples known to Paus. 2 . 31 . 6 . A prytaneion is attested in a decree of C4l/C3e (Wilhelm ( 1974 ) i. 38 ). An extra-urban complex with a stadion , associated with Asklepios and Hippolytos, dates from C4l or C3e (Welter ( 1941 ) 35 -38 ; Jameson et al . ( 1994 ) 83 ). Troizen was apparently fortified in 369 (Diod. 15 . 69 . 1 ) but the sparse remains of a defence circuit in polygonal mason- ry are tentatively dated to C3e (Welter ( 1941 ) 12 ), a date which, according to Maier ( 1959 ) no. 32 , is pure guesswork. For the construction of a diateichismos in 146 , see IG iv 757 = Maier ( 1959 ) no. 32 . AtPs.-Skylax 52 Troizen is classified as a πόλις καιgrave λι µ ήν . The name of the harbour was Πώγων , and the Greek fleet rallied there before the battle of Salamis (Hdt. 8 . 42 . 1 ; Strabo 8 . 6 . 14 ). The foundation myth, like that of Athens, involved both Athena and Poseidon. According to Paus. 2 . 30 . 6 , the myth was reflected in the oldest types of Troizenian coins, which combined the head of Athena with the trident of Poseidon. Troizen struck silver coins on the Attic standard from c. 460 onwards. Denominations: drachm, pentobol, triobol, diobol, obol. Types: obv . head of Athena facing, or head of ## II. The Poleis"
358,Aigina (Aiginatas),The Saronic Gulf,37.45,23.3,2376,12014,"358 . Aigina (Aiginatas) Map. 57 . Lat. 37 . 45 , long. 23 . 30 . Size of territory: 2 ( 85 . 9 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Αίγινα , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 562 ; Thuc. 1 . 105 . 2 ; IG iv² . 1 102 . 270 (C4f)). The city-ethnic is Αιγινήτης ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 18 ), in Doric Αιγινάτας ( IvO 143 . 2 ( 488 ); SEG 46 474 (C5e)). Aigina is attested as a polis in the political sense ( ευacuteνο µ ος : Pind. Isthm . 5 . 22 ; Bacchyl. 13 . 185 ; Hdt. 2 . 178 . 3 ), in the urban sense (Hdt. 6 . 88 . 1 ; Dem. 23 . 211 ; Ps.-Skylax 53 ) and as totality of territory = asty + chora (Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 9 ). At Bacchyl. ## THE SARONIC GULF ## thomas j . figueira 13 . 71 ( πόλιν υasperψιάγυιαν ) the reference is presumably to the acropolis. For a reference to Aigina as asty , see Bacchyl. 13 . 188 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C4 coins (abbreviated as ΑΙΓΙ (Head, HN ² 397 )) and externally in inscriptions (ML 27 . 3 ( 479 -478 ); ATL ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 18 ); the Spartan War Contribution Accounts ( SEG 39 370 .A 3 (C5 or C4 )), and in literature (Hdt. 3 . 59 . 4 , 8 . 93 . 1 ; Thuc. 1 . 14 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 2 ). The external individual use is found in Hdt. 4 . 152 . 3 , 8 . 93 . 1 ; IvO 143 . 2 ( 488 ); SEG 46 474 (C5e); CID ii 31 . 78 ( 345 )). Patra ( = patris ) is attested in Pind. Ol . 8 . 20 and IG ii² 7965 (C4m). Aigina was structurally atypical because of high economic output from commerce (Arist. Pol . 1291 b 24 ). It had two or three harbours (cf. Ps.-Skylax 53 ) and a flourishing emporion (Dem. 23 . 211 ; Ephor. fr. 176 ). Demographic indicators derive from fleet mobilisations. During the C5e acme, the total population was 35 , 000 -45 , 000 , with 7 , 000 -10 , 000 slaves/freedmen and 1 , 500 -2 , 500 males of or above hoplite rank (Figueira ( 1981 ) 22 -52 ). This level was attained through assimilation of mainly servile immigrants. In spite of serious exaggeration, Arist. fr. 475 . 1 testifies to an exceptionally high number of slaves, and fr. 475 . 2 may imply a high number of foreigners (Figueira ( 1991 ) 84 -86 , ( 1993 ) 206 -8 ). Naturalisation was limited or protracted. Even an euergetes , the naukleros Lampis (C4m),only achieved ateleia as a metic (Dem. 23 . 211 ). Refounded Aigina (C4 ) had a substantially lower population. Inscriptions attest to foreigners in residence (e.g. IG iv 50 ). For Aigina, geographical perceptions reinforced cultural affinities. On social structure, cf. Winterscheidt ( 1938 ). For Aiginetan history, see the chronological table in Figueira ( 1993 ) 409 -18 with refs.; also Amit ( 1973 ) 9 -60 . In C8m-C7l, Aigina had sub-political status under foreign hegemony. Hegemony by Argos (no. 347 ) was mediated through the cult league of Apollo Pythaieus (Hdt. 6 . 92 . 1 -2 ; cf. Pheidon's apocryphal minting: Ephor.fr. 115 ). Aigina participated in the Kalaurian Amphiktyony (Strabo 8 . 6 . 14 ). In C7l, Aigina was controlled by Epidauros (no. 348 ) and became independent in a violent secession (Hdt. 5 . 83 . 1 -2 ). Heltic inscriptions mention a pentapolis that might indicate a synoecism (Felten ( 1975 ) 42 -52 ). Subsequent Aiginetan membership in the Peloponnesian League is unlikely. In 506 , the 'Heraldless War' began with the Athenians (no. 361 ) (Hdt. 5 . 80 . 2 ). Aigina submitted to Persia before Marathon (Hdt. 6 . 49 . 1 ). Effective medising was precluded by a hostage taking by Kleomenes I (Hdt. 6 . 73 . 2 ). In the early 480 s, stasis flared in an Athenian-inspired populist uprising under Nikodromos (an aristocratic exile). After brutal suppression, fugitives became Athenians, later assisting against Aigina (Hdt. 6 . 88 -91 ); see Gehrke, Stasis 15 -16 . In 481 , the Aiginetans joined the Hellenic League (Hdt. 7 . 145 . 1 ; ML 27 . 3 ), winning the aristeia at Salamis (Hdt. 8 . 93 . 1 ). Remaining aloof from the Delian League until 457 -456 , Aigina was reduced to tributary status (Thuc. 1 . 108 . 4 ). It belonged to the Island district ( IG i³ 270 . v . 37 ) and is registered in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 18 ) to 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 279 . i . 88 ) a total of ten times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 30 tal. in all years except 450 / 49 , when the payment was 26 tal., 1 , 200 dr. ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 39 , ethnic restored), and 432 / 1 , when it was either 9 or 14 tal. Returning fugitives and pro-Athenians promoted a cult of Athena Polias ( IG iv 29 -32 ). Tributary status ended with an expulsion in 431 . Aiginetans scattered, fled to Kydonia (no. 968 ), or were harboured in the Thyreatis (as a Spartan dependency: Thuc. 2 . 27 . 2 ); some assisted Spartan campaigning ( 4 . 57 . 1 -4 ). An Attic apoikia , in which a remnant population was supplemented by reinforcing settlers, occupied Aigina, claiming to represent the Aiginetan polis (Thuc. 2 . 27 . 1 ; 8 . 69 . 3 ); the 5 per cent import/export tax was levied there (Ar. Ran . 362 -64 , 380 -81 with schol.). See also Figueira ( 1991 ) 79 -128 . In 405 , Lysander refounded Aigina (Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 9 ). Under Spartan harmostai , Aigina fought in the Corinthian War ( Hell . 5 . 1 . 1 -24 ), causing damage that helped motivate Athens toward the King's Peace ( Hell . 5 . 1 . 29 ). When fighting flared up in 378 , the Aiginetans resumed raiding ( Hell . 5 . 4 . 61 , 6 . 2 . 1 ) that is unclearly demarcated from later attacks ( 350 -340 s) probably taken in conjunction with Makedonia (Demades fr. 67 ). Except for the Attic apoikia , politics was dominated by aristocratic clans or phratries ( patrai ), celebrated by Pindar ( Pyth . 8 . 38 ), the status of whose members ( pakhees : Hdt. 6 . 91 . 1 ; dynatoi : Paus. 3 . 4 . 2 ) is also witnessed by chamber tombs (see Jeffery ( 1974 )). An Aristoteleian politeia is attested (Arist. fr. 475 ). Two outstanding figures were Krios, who resisted Kleomenes (Hdt. 6 . 50 . 2 -3 ), and his son Polykritos, a leader at Salamis ( 8 . 92 . 1 -2 ). Aigina's fleet was the predominant military instrument (Thuc. 1 . 14 . 3 ), supposedly mak- ing the Aiginetans thalassocrats 490 -480 (Diod. 7 fr. 11 ). An agreement with Athens ( 450 -446 ) makes security arrangements ( IG i³ 38 ). A notable C4e enactment mandated execution for Athenians taken on Aigina (Diog. Laert. 3 . 19 (r 390 s)). Significant Aiginetan diplomacy included the message of Polyarchos, probably a Spartan proxenos , that the walls of Athens were being reconstructed in 478 (Plut. Them . 19 . 2 ) and covert agitation at Sparta (no. 345 ) on the eve of the Peloponnesian War (Thuc. 1 . 67 . 2 ). In the 480 s and later, Aigina was a haven for Attic ostracised (Dem. 26 . 6 ; Adespota Comica 3 . 40 , Kock). Likely Aiginetan proxenoi at Athens were Aristeides and Thoukydides Melesiou. A proxenos at Plataia is attested (Hdt. 9 . 85 . 3 ). For a possible Aiginetan proxenos for Rhodos at Naukratis (no. 1023 ), see Syll . ³ 110 . The epinicia of Pindar and the status of Aiakos as a judge of souls attest to the quality of the legal system (especially toward xenoi ). The Aegineticus of Isokrates ( 19 ) was delivered in an Aiginetan court by a Siphnian exile.The boule and demos are attested in post-Classical inscriptions only (e.g. IG iv 1 . 1 ). The thearoi werea prestigious board,whose duties probably transcended cult supervision (schol. Pind. Nem . 3 . 122 a-b with Figueira ( 1981 ) 314 -21 ). A doubtful civic eponymous is the priest of Aphaia used to date Archaic construction at the sanctuary ( IG iv 1580 ). Tribes and demes are attested in an inscription of 159 -144 ( IG iv 1 . 43 -44 ). Additional cults (with attested festival: *):Athena,Aiakos*, Aiakidai, Aphaia*, Aphrodite*, Apollo Pythios/Delphinios*, Apollo and Poseidon, Damia and Auxesia*, Poseidon Hippourios* and Zeus Hellanios*. The Hydrophoria was celebrated in the month Delphinios to Apollo Delphinios as oikistes (schol. Pind. Nem . 5 . 81 a-b).At Salamis the Aiakidai were ritually summoned (Hdt. 8 . 64 . 2 , 83 -84 ). A doubtful Delphic consultation by the Aiginetan exiles none the less became proverbial ( CPG 1 . 22 -23 ). Gold stars were dedicated for the aristeia at Salamis (Hdt. 8 . 122 ). A polyandrion , commemorating casualties at Plataia, was dedicated in 469 (Hdt. 9 . 85 . 3 ). Aiginetans were prominent at Delphi after the Third Sacred War (Figueira ( 1993 ) 356 -58 ). IG iv39 and 1588 are inventories of dedications inscribed under the apoikia . Aiginetans are attested as victors at all the major Panhellenic games: the Olympic (Pind. Ol . 8 ), the Pythian (Pind. Pyth . 8 ), the Nemean (Pind. Nem . 3 -8 ; Bacchyl. 12 -13 ) and the Isthmian (Pind. Isthm . 5 -6 , 8 -9 ). Aiginetans won altogether twentyeight attested major victories (e.g. SEG 39 255 ). Note Praxidamas Olympionikes in 544 , victorious in the Nemean and Isthmian Games as well,and the first to have his statue set up at Olympia (Pind. Nem . 6 . 15 -18 ; Paus. 6 . 18 . 7 ); see further Mann ( 2001 ) 192 -235 . Public architecture and art (on which Aigina lavished its wealth) can only be summarised. See Welter ( 1938 b ) and Walter ( 1993 ). Pausanias mentions a temple of Aphrodite, Aiakeion, Phokeion, kryptos limen and its mole, theatre, stadion (C5 -C4 according to Krinzinger ( 1968 )), temples of Apollo, Artemis and Dionysos, Asklepieion, a temple of Hekate, and extra-urban sanctuaries of Aphaia and Damia/Auxesia ( 2 . 29 . 6 -30 . 5 ). The acropolis on Cape Colonna was impressive as excavations of (e.g.) the C6l Apollo temple(s) and Thearion have confirmed (published in the series Alt-Ägina ). The temenos and temple of Aphaia have had a long history of excavation, since the recovery of sculptures by the Dilettanti in 1811 (Ohly ( 1976 ) pp. xi-xiii; Bankel ( 1993 )). The Hellanion on Mt. Oros is demonstrated by excavation to have been another important sanctuary. The military harbour with its ship sheds ( 480 s) was a 'state of the art' facility (see Knoblauch ( 1972 )). Remains have been found of the circuit of fortifications of the city, extended in C5e against the Attic threat (Welter ( 1938 a ) 480 -85 ). The walls enclosed an area of c. 52 ha (Figueira ( 1981 ) 39 -40 . Aigina was besieged in 460 / 59 (Thuc. 1 . 105 . 2 ; Lys. 2 . 49 ), and the walls demolished in 457 (Thuc. 1 . 108 . 4 ). Aigina is attested as a walled city in 389 (Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 2 ; cf. Aen. Tact. 20 . 5 ). The mint was the earliest producer of silver (from 560 to 540 ). The Aiginetan standard was much imitated. Its 'turtles' , the coins par excellence of the Peloponnesos (Poll. 9 . 74 ), minted in huge numbers and with high purity, were widely disseminated, dominating circulation in several regions ( IGCH ( 1974 ) 394 ; Figueira ( 1998 ) 36 -41 , 116 -27 ). Aiginetan money was critical in the monetisation of the Archaic economy.In C5m,the obverse design became a tortoise,while the reverse type remained a conventional incuse square. In C4 , the city-ethnic in abbreviation (e.g. ΑΙΓΙ ) was affixed to the reverse. Denominations: didrachm stater, drachm, triobol, obol, hemiobol (C6 -456 ); stater, drachm, triobol, obol, hemiobol (from C4e). Bronze coins were struck in C4l or C3 : obv . two or three dolphins circling around the letter Α ; rev . incuse square divided into five compartments,sometimes with legend ΑΙ in upper compartments (Head, HN ² 394 -98 ; SNG Cop. Attica-Aegina 501 -39 ; SNG München , Attika, Megaris, Äigina). As a long-distance trading community,Aigina was not an active coloniser, but colonised Kydonia (no. 968 ) in 519 , Adria (no. 75 ) c. C6l, and Damastion in Illyria after 431 (Strabo 8 . 6 . 16 ). With Miletos (no. 854 ) and Samos (no. 864 ), Aigina was significant at Naukratis (no. 1023 ) (Hdt. 2 . 178 . 3 ). The Aiginetan claim to autochthony (Hellan. fr. 27 ) rested on their identity as the Myrmidons metamorphosed from ants by Zeus at the behest of his son Aiakos (Hes. fr. 205 , MW; hence the toponym Myrmidonia : Steph. Byz. s.v. Μυρ µ ιδονία ). Historiography suggests successive waves of settlers (Paus. 2 . 29 . 5 )."
359,Belbina (Belbinites),The Saronic Gulf,37.3,23.55,271,1370,"359 . Belbina (Belbinites) Map. 58 . Lat. 37 . 30 , long. 23 . 55 . Size of territory: 1 ( c. 7 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Βέλβινα , ηasper , the name of the island being identical with that of its polis (Ps.-Skylax 51 ; Strabo 8 . 6 . 16 ). The city-ethnic is Βελβινίτης (Hdt. 8 . 125 . 2 ) or Βελβινείτης (Teles, Peri Phyges p. 27 , Hense (C3f)). Belbina is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 51 . Its status as a polis in the political sense is indicated by its appearance among the members of the Delian League in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 88 ), where the city-ethnic is used in the external and collective sense. For the individual sense, see the ancedote in Hdt. 8 . 125 . 2 , where Themistokles admits that he would never have come to fame if he had been a Belbinites. For Belbina's proverbial insignificance see also Teles ( supra ). In the decree of 425 / 4 ( supra ) Belbina was assessed at the modest sum of 300 drachms. Poor and sparsely populated, Belbina may not have seemed worth assessing before, in which case 425 may be its first actual assessment. Or Belbina may have been assessed in an apotaxis from a larger neighbour, in which an overarching dependency on Athens weakened an earlier regional subordination. Remains of a nucleated settlement have not been excavated (Ross ( 1840 -43 ) i. 4 , ii. 172 -73 )."
360,Kalaureia (Kalaureates),The Saronic Gulf,37.3,23.3,478,2446,"360 . Kalaureia (Kalaureates) Map. 58 . Lat. 37 . 30 , long. 23 . 30 . Size of territory: 2 ( 31 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Καλαυacuteρεα , ηasper ( Syll . ³ 359 . 1 -2 (C4l)) or Καλαυacuteρεια (Dem. 49 . 13 ) or Καλαυρία (Ps.-Skylax 52 ). According to the C3 historian Antikleides (( FGrHist 140 ) fr. 9 ) the island was originally called Ειρήνη , but Καλαυacuteρεια is attested as early as Hecat.fr. 125 . The city-ethnic is Καλαυρεάτας ( Syll . ³ 359 . 4 -5 ). Kalaureia is called a polis in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 52 and in the political sense in a C4s decree: έδοξε ταtildeι πόλι τηtildeν Καλαυρεαταtildeν ( Syll . ³ 359 . 3 -5 ) where the city-ethnic is used in the collective and internal sense.The external individual use is attested in C3 honorary decrees from Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² 96 . 43 ) and Delphi (no. 177 ) ( SEG 14 402 ). From possibly C6l (Hdt. 3 . 59 . 1 ) and during C5 -C4l Kalaureia was a possession of Troizen (no. 357 ); the Aristotelian constitution of the Troizenians treated Kalaureia (Arist. fr. 614 ), and the C5l sculptor Pison could be described as 'from Kalaureia of the Troizenians' ( εκ Καλαυρείας τηtildeς Τροιζηνίων ) (Paus. 10 . 9 . 8 ; cf. 6 . 3 . 5 ). The island served as a naval station: a fleet of Timotheos used it in 374 (Dem. 49 ). After the Lamian War, the polis is presented as the political authority for a grant of ateleia to Siphnos in IG iv 839 = Syll . ³ 359 (C4l)). The eponymous magistrate was a tamias ( IG iv 839 , 841 ). [Plut.] Mor . 846 F has been taken to imply the authority of local officials at Kalaureia just before the death of Demosthenes. In general, see Welter ( 1941 ) 53 -57 . According to Ps.-Skylax 52 , Kalaureia had a harbour (limen) and its urban centre contained an agora in which a (Heltic?) bouleuterion has been excavated (cf. IG iv 841 . 24 ). The nearby Heroon may be connected with both Asklepios and/or Demosthenes ( IG iv 847 ; see Welter ( 1941 ) 51 -52 ). At Kalaureia was located the sanctuary of Poseidon Kalauros,known from C8e with a temple from 6 Cl, expanded in C5l-C4 (ibid. 45 -50 ) and four stoas of C5l-C4l (Coulton ( 1976 ) 242 -43 ). The sanctuary served as an asylum (Ephor. fr. 150 ), hence the alternative toponym Eirene . In refuge there, Demosthenes committed suicide; and his µ νηtilde µ α stood within the sanctuary,perhaps represented by a circular foundation west of the temple (Attic decree cited in ## II. The Poleis"
361,Athenai (Athenaios),Attika,38.0,23.45,12379,60134,"361 . Athenai (Athenaios) Map 59 . Lat. 38 . 00 , long. 23 . 45 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A. The toponym is Αθηtildeναι , αιasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 546 ; Ar. Nub . 207 ; Lys. 6 . 25 ; Pl. Leg . 753 A; IG i³ 1178 . 1 ( 433 / 2 )), in Doric Αθαtildeναι ( IG iv² 1 94 . 3 ( 359 )). The toponym usually denotes the town (Dem. 56 . 9 ; Ps.-Skylax 57 ), but sometimes the town plus its hinterland (ML 23 . 4 ; Din. 2 . 25 ) and sometimes the political community (Thuc. 1 . 44 . 2 ; Pl. Leg . 753 A; Arist. Ath . Pol . 19 . 4 ). The city-ethnic is Αθηναῖος (Solon fr. 4 . 30 , West; Dem. 1 . 1 ; ML 15 ( 506 ), 27 . 2 ( 479 / 8 ); CID ii 32 . 33 (C4m)), in the Doric dialect Αθαναῖος ( IvO 30 (C5 )). Athens is called a polis in the territorial sense (Thuc. 2 . 48 ; Dem. 10 . 63 ; Din. 1 . 77 ; ML 23 . 4 (C4m)), in the urban sense (Hdt. 7 . 133 . 2 ; Thuc. 2 . 57 ; Dem. 18 . 204 , 230 ; IG i³ 136 . 4 ( 413 / 12 )), and in the political sense (Hdt. 6 . 106 . 2 ; Thuc. 1 . 70 . 6 ; Hell. Oxy . 9 . 3 ; Theopomp.fr. 88 ; Arist. Pol . 1304 a 10 ; IG i³ 92 . 8 ( 416 / 15 )). Polis in the sense of akropolis is used in fixed idioms down to C4e ( IG i³ 4 B. 3 ( 485 / 4 ); IG ii² 17 . 10 ( 394 / 3 ), see Henry ( 1982 ); Thuc. 2 . 15 . 6 ). The urban centre is called asty (Pl. Phdr . 230 D; Dem. 42 . 7 ; Hesperia suppl. 29 p. 4 . 13 ), and during the civil war of 404 / 3 the oligarchs residing in Athens are frequently referred to as οιasper εξ άστεως (Lys. 12 . 55 ; Xen. Hell . 2 . 4 . 7 ; Dem. 20 . 12 ); the term polisma is found at Hdt. 1 . 143 . 2 and Aesch. Eum . 668 . For Athens as the patris of the Athenians, see Solon fr. 36 . 8 , West; Plato Com. fr. 217 , PCG ; Isoc. 10 . 35 ). A C4epigram describes an Athenian klerouchos as having a double patris : viz . Athens and Samos ( CEG 594 . 10 -11 ). The collective sense of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ), in inscriptions ( IG i³ 14 . 22 -24 (C5m); IG ii² 1 . 3 -4 ( 403 / 2 )) and in literary sources (Solon fr. 4 . 30 , West; Pl. Euthphr . 2 A; Dem. 1 . 1 ) and externally in inscriptions (ML 25 ( 479 ); SEG 33 440 A ( 375 / 4 )) and literary sources (Pind. Pyth . 1 . 76 ; Hdt. 1 . 29 . 1 ; Hell. Oxy . 1 . 2 ). The individual use is in a few cases attested internally (Thuc. 1 . 1 . 1 ; Pl. Prt . 311 C), whereas attestations of the external use abound (ML 27 . 2 ( 479 / 8 ); CID ii 4 . i . 67 ( 361 / 60 ); IG xii . 5 542 . 36 -41 (C4m); Tod 196 . 5 ( 330 -326 )). Kleisthenes wanted membership of a demos ( infra ) to become part of an Athenian citizen's full name (Arist. Ath . Pol . 21 . 4 ), and in C4 this reform had caught on so that,inside Attika,a citizen was called by name,patronymic and demotic ( IG ii² 5228 -7855 ; Whitehead ( 1986 ) 69 -75 ). Klerouchies excepted ( IG xii . 6 252 -76 : Samos ( 366 -322 )), attestations of the demotic used outside Athens and Attika are rare ( IG xii . 5 113 (C4s from Paros)). In the Classical period, Athens was probably the most populous of all the Hellenic poleis . In the Persian War,Athens provided 9 , 000 hoplites at Marathon (Nep. Milt . 5 ; Suda Ι 545 ; cf. Paus. 10 . 20 . 2 ) and 8 , 000 at Plataiai (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 6 ). At Artemision they provided 127 ships (Hdt. 8 . 1 . 1 ), and 180 at Salamis (Hdt. 8 . 44 . 1 ). In 431 Athens had a field army of 15 , 800 men,of whom 13 , 000 were citizen hoplites; a defence force of 16 , 000 , of whom 3 , 000 were metic hoplites,and a navy of 300 triremes (Thuc. 2 . 13 . 6 -7 ; Hansen ( 1981 )). There were altogether some 50 , 000 -60 , 000 adult male citizens (Rhodes ( 1988 ) 271 -77 ; Hansen ( 1988 ) 23 -25 ). Due to the plague in 430 -426 , war casualties during the Peloponnesian War, and the siege of 405 / 4 , the number of citizens dropped to some 25 , 000 -30 , 000 in c. 400 (Hansen ( 1988 ) 14 -28 ). During C4 the number of Athenian citizens living in Attika must have been in the range of 30 , 000 , ± a few thousand (Hansen ( 1985 ) 65 -69 ; ( 1994 )). The war effort in the Lamian War of 323 / 2 (Diod. 18 . 10 . 2 , 11 . 3 ; IG ii² 1631 . 167 -74 ) presupposes that there must have been no fewer than 30 , 000 full citizens living in Attika (Hansen ( 1985 ) 37 -40 ; ( 1994 ) 308 -10 ). The result of a census conducted by Demetrios of Phaleron during the decade 317 -307 was 21 , 000 Athenians and 10 , 000 metics (Ath. 272 C). The census, called exetasmos , was probably a military review of able-bodied citizens of military age (Hansen ( 1985 ) 29 -35 ; ( 1994 ) 301 -2 ). For lower population figures, see Gomme ( 1933 ) 27 : 43 , 000 in 431 ; Ruschenbusch ( 1984 ) and Sekunda ( 1992 ): c. 21 , 000 in C4 . Numbers of free foreigners and slaves fluctuated constantly in accordance with trade and prosperity (Xen. Vect . 2 . 1 -7 ; Hansen ( 1988 ) 10 -12 ). Ten thousand metics were counted in Demetrios' census (Ath. 272 C), perhaps an army figure rather than a population figure (Hansen ( 1985 ) 31 -32 ), and comparing the number of C4 tombstones commemorating metics ( 650 , of whom 40 per cent are women) with those commemorating citizens ( 2 , 110 , of whom 35 per cent are women), we can infer that there must have been a sizeable population of metics (Nielsen et al . ( 1989 ) 419 ; Hansen et al . ( 1990 ) 26 ). Down to the end of C4 , c. 875 citizens of 149 different poleis (Abdera, Abydos, etc.) and c. 150 persons from forty different regions and islands (Achaia, Aitolia, etc.) are attested as foreign residents of Athens (Osborne and Byrne ( 1996 )). Classical sources testify to more than 100 citizenship decrees (Osborne ( 1981 -83 ) D 1 -25 and T 1 -82 ), in most cases individual and purely honorific grants of citizenship to foreign notables, but foreign residents were naturalised too (T 30 -31 ), and especially in C5 there were also some block grants to, for example, the Plataians in 427 (Dem. 59 . 104 -5 ; D 1 ) and to the Samians in 405 / 4 ( IG ii² 1 . 51 -5 ; D 4 ). We have no reliable evidence for the number of slaves, but rough, exaggerated estimates indicate that the number of slaves may even have equalled the number of free (Hyp. fr. 33 , Sauppe; Ath. 272 C;Isager and Hansen ( 1975 ) 15 -18 ). However,the estimate of 30 , 000 slaves working in the silver mines in C4s is on the high side (Lauffer ( 1979 ) 155 -62 ). Sallares ( 1991 ) 57 suggests 11 , 000 max.in C5m. This is not the place to survey the history of Athens, and the rest of this entry comprises (A) the relations with other poleis ; (B) the constitution, including the civic subdivisions; (C) the Athenian religion; (D) the urban centre of Athens, including Peiraieus; and (E) the Athenian coinage. (A) Athenian membership of leagues and large alliances starts with the Hellenic League, formed in 481 against Persia (Hdt. 7 . 132 . 2 , 145 . 1 ; Staatsverträge 130 ) and the Athenians are recorded among the victors on the Serpent Column in Delphi (ML 27 . 2 ) and in Olympia (Paus. 5 . 23 . 1 ). The Athenians were the hegemonic leaders of the Delian League, 478 -404 (Arist. Ath . Pol . 23 . 5 ; Thuc. 1 . 95 -97 ; Staatsverträge 132 ; Meiggs ( 1972 ); Schuller ( 1974 )). In the years 404 -395 they were members of the Peloponnesian League (Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 20 ; Staatsverträge 211 ). Between 378 / 7 and 338 they were the hegemonic leaders of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 ; Paus. 1 . 25 . 3 ; Staatsverträge 257 ; Cargill ( 1981 ); Dreher ( 1995 )), and in 338 / 7 they joined the Corinthian League ( IG ii² 236 ; Staatsverträge 403 ). Athens was a member of the Delphic amphiktyony and provided ex officio one of the two Ionic hieromnemones (Aeschin. 2 . 116 ; CID ii 94 . 4 ( 328 / 7 ); Lefèvre ( 1998 ) 63 -69 ). The Athenians possessed a treasury in Delphi (Partida ( 2000 ) 48 -70 ), and eight communal dedications by the Athenians have been found (Jacquemin ( 1999 ) 315 -16 ). SEG 14 350 is a c. 500 dedication at Olympia ( Αθεναῖοι [ τ ] ˜ ον εγ Λέ µ ν [ ο ]), and SEG 22 346 (C5f) is one of Persian spoils. The Athenians sent out heralds ( κήρυκες , ML 45 . 9 (C5s)) and envoys, called first άγγελοι (Hdt. 5 . 73 . 1 ), from C5s mostly πρέσβεις ( IG ii² 43 . 72 -77 ( 378 / 7 )); the envoys were sent to other poleis (Thuc. 5 . 22 . 3 ) or to monarchs (Thuc. 2 . 67 . 2 ) or to federal governments ( IG ii² 116 , 176 : Thessaly in 361 / 60 ) or to international peace conferences (Xen. Hell . 6 . 3 . 1 -3 ( 372 / 1 )). Mostly boards of envoys were sent out, often ten at a time (Aeschin. 2 . 18 ( 347 / 6 ); Mosley ( 1973 ) 55 -63 ). For an (incomplete) list of ninety-two attested embassies sent out from Athens in the Archaic and Classical periods, see Kienast ( 1973 ) 595 -611 . Conversely, foreign embassies were received in Athens by the prytaneis and admitted to the boule and the ekklesia ( IG i³ 40 . 12 -14 ( 446 / 5 ); Mosley ( 1973 ) 78 -79 ). Two examples are envoys from Leontinoi in 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 54 ) and envoys from Dionysios I of Syracuse in 368 / 7 ( IG ii² 105 ). Athenian theorodokoi hosted theoroi sent from Delphi in C5l ( Syll. ³ 90 . 16 -17 ) and from Epidauros in 359 ( IG iv²1 94 . i a. 3 ). Athens had proxenoi in most Greek poleis . To the end of the Classical period close to 100 are attested in inscriptions. These proxenoi are citizens of sixty-three different Hellenic poleis , of two Phoenician city-states-Sidon ( IG ii² 141 , 343 ) and Tyros ( IG ii² 342 )-and three were the kings of Makedon (Walbank ( 1978 ) 1 ), of the Pelagonians ( IG ii² 190 ) and of the Messapians (Walbank ( 1978 ) 70 ; Marek ( 1984 ), excluding 5 , 8 , 14 , 21 , 42 , 53 , 59 , 65 , 68 , 72 , 76 and 80 , but adding SEG 40 57 , 72 ; SEG 45 59 , 76 ). T o these proxenoi must be added all those mentioned in literary sources (Thuc. 3 . 2 . 3 ; Dem. 7 . 38 , etc.; Monceaux ( 1886 ) 321 -23 , fourteen attestations). Conversely, in the same period, Athenian citizens are attested as proxenoi appointed by different Hellenic poleis . Thus, in C4m, Karthaia on Keos lists a minimum of fifteen and perhaps twenty different Athenians as their proxenoi in Athens ( IG xii . 5 542 . 35 -45 ). For attestations in literary sources, cf. Aeschin. 3 . 138 and Monceaux ( 1886 ) 323 -25 , fourteen attestations) Athenians were victorious in all the Panhellenic games.In the Olympic Games, thirty-five victories are attested covering the period 696 -328 . Victors include Kylon ( 640 ?) (Hdt. 5 . 71 . 1 ), Miltiades ( 560 ) (Hdt. 6 . 36 . 1 ), Peisistratos ( 532 ) (Hdt. 6 . 103 . 2 ), Alkibiades ( 416 ) (Thuc. 6 . 16 . 2 ) and, perhaps, Demades ( 328 ) ( Suda ∆ 414 ); see Olympionikai 56 , 106 , 124 , 345 , 467 . In the Pythian Games, twenty victories from c. 542 to 374 . Victors include Chabrias in 374 (Dem. 59 . 34 ); see Kyle ( 1987 ) A 3 , 4 , 15 , 17 , 29 , 30 , 42 , 43 , 58 , 71 , P 95 , 107 ; Krause ( 1841 ) 105 -6 ). In the Nemean Games, thirty victories from C6l to C4e. Victors include Alkibiades (Paus. 1 . 22 . 6 ) and Lysis (Pl. Lysis 205 C); see Kyle ( 1987 ) A 1 , 4 , 15 , 29 , 42 , 45 , 57 , 58 , 64 , 74 , 78 ). In the Isthmian Games, twenty-four victories from C5e to C4f. Victors include, perhaps, Plato ( Proleg. Plat. Phil . 2 , p. 198 , Hermann); see Kyle ( 1987 ) A 1 , 15 , 18 , 29 , 42 , 57 , 74 , 78 , P 86 , P 107 (Plato); Krause ( 1841 ) 222 ). The Athenians organised the Panathenaic Games, which were Panhellenic ( IG ii² 2311 (C4f); Pl. Leg . 833 A-B; Arist. Ath . Pol . 54 . 7 , 60 . 3 ; Kyle ( 1987 ) 33 -39 ). In addition to Athenians, many foreigners are attested as victors ( IG ii² 2312 (C4 ); Kyle ( 1987 ) 38 n. 28 . (B) The Constitution of the Athenians is the only surviving one out of the 158 Aristotelian politeiai (Rhodes ( 1981 ); Chambers ( 1990 ); Keaney ( 1992 )), and since its rediscovery in 1890 it has been the backbone of any reconstruction of the history of the Athenian constitution, starting with Wilamowitz-Moellendorff ( 1893 ). According to the local traditions, Athens was originally ruled by hereditary basileis (Arist. Ath . Pol . 41 . 2 , frr. 1 -2 ; Hellan. ( FGrHist 323 a) fr. 23 ), and these traditions are usually believed to contain a core of truth (Carlier ( 1984 ) 359 -72 ). Kingship was replaced by government by magistrates appointed from the rich and well-born (Arist. Ath . Pol . 3 . 1 : αριστίνδην καιgrave πλουτίνδην ). The most powerful magistrates were the nine archontes (Thuc. 1 . 126 . 8 : Arist. Ath . Pol . 13 . 3 ), of whom the chief was the eponymous official ( IG i³ 4 A. 14 -175 ( 485 / 4 )). The Athenian list of archontes , published in C5l (ML 6 ), went back to the archonship of Kreon in 683 / 2 (Hieronymus p. 93 , Helm), or 684 / 3 (Develin ( 1989 ) 27 -28 )). According to Herodotos ( 5 . 71 . 2 ), an important political assembly was the prytaneis of the forty-eight naukrariai ; but we do not know what a naukraria was, nor even whether the word is connected with naus ('ship') or naos ('temple') (Billigmeier and Dusing ( 1981 )). That Athens had an Assembly of the People is extrapolated from later evidence (Solon fr. 36 . 1 -2 ; Andrewes ( 1982 ) 387 ). And the Athenians did not themselves know whether the Council of the Areopagoscomposed of all ex-archons-had been instituted by Solon (Plut. Sol . 19 ; Arist. Pol . 1273 b 35 -41 ) or had existed long before his time (Arist. Ath . Pol . 1273 b 41 -74 a 3 ; see Wallace ( 1989 ) 3 -47 ). During C7 growing social and economic tensions produced a series of political crises from about 630 to 530 , of which the most important resulted in the coup of Kylon, the laws of Drakon, the reforms of Solon, and the tyranny of Peisistratos. In 636 or 632 an Athenian called Kylon attempted to set himself up as tyrannos of the city. The coup failed, Kylon fled, and his followers were put to death (Hdt. 5 . 71 ; Thuc. 1 . 126 . 3 -12 ; Welwei ( 1992 ) 133 -37 ). A few years later, in 621 (Develin ( 1989 ) 31 ), Athens acquired its first written code of laws, compiled by Drakon (Arist. Ath . Pol . 7 . 1 ; Arist. Pol . 1274 b 15 -16 ). His law of homicide remained in force, with modifications ( IG i³ 104 ; Tulin ( 1996 ) 3 -19 ), right down to the time of Demosthenes (Dem. 23 . 51 ); but the rest of his laws, whose penalties were 'written not in ink but in blood'(Plut. Sol . 17 . 3 ; Arist. Pol . 1274 b 15 -18 ), were superseded in the very next generation by those of Solon (Arist. Ath . Pol . 7 . 1 ). In 594 , rich and poor united to give the archon Solon plenary power to dictate a compromise (Welwei ( 1992 ) 161 -206 ). He began with a general amnesty (Plut. Sol . 19 . 4 ), then abolished enslavement for debt (Arist. Ath . Pol . 6 . 1 ) and gave freedom to those so enslaved, even those who had been sold abroad (Solon fr. 36 . 8 -15 ). Next, he freed the indebted tenants, the hektemoroi , from the sixth-parts they paid to their landlords and allowed them to hold their land free of obligations (Arist. Ath . Pol . 6 . 1 ; Solon fr. 36 . 3 -6 ); but he set himself against a redistribution of the land (Solon fr. 34 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 11 . 2 ). Besides his economic reforms, Solon also reformed the administration of justice. According to later tradition he set up a People's Court, called the Heliaia (Arist. Pol . 1273 b 35 - a 3 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 7 . 3 , 9 . 1 ), manned by sworn jurors (Arist. Pol . 1274 a 3 ; Hansen ( 1983 ) 153 -55 , ( 1989 ) 242 -49 , 258 -61 contra Ostwald ( 1986 ) 10 -11 ) and gave every party to any lawsuit the right to appeal to the Heliaia against the award of the magistrates (Lys. 10 . 16 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 9 . 1 ). Since Solon's time the Athenians were divided into four property classes: pentakosiomedimnoi (men worth 500 medimnoi 'measures' of natural produce), hippeis (knights), zeugitai (owners of a yoke of oxen) and thetes (literally 'menials' , day-labourers) (Arist. Ath . Pol . 7 . 3 ). The thetes were excluded from all state offices (Arist. Ath . Pol . 7 . 3 -4 ), and to the most important offices the electors-probably the People's Assembly (Solon fr. 5 . 1 -2 )-could appoint only citizens from the top two classes (Arist. Ath . Pol . 8 . 1 , 26 . 2 , 47 . 1 ; Hignett ( 1952 ) 101 -2 ). However, of Solon's constitutional reforms the most important, according to the tradition, was his creation of a Council of Four Hundred, 100 from each of the four tribes (Arist. Ath . Pol . 8 . 4 ). Solon carried out a new codification of the laws (Solon fr. 36 . 18 -20 ; Hdt. 1 . 29 . 1 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 7 . 1 ; Rhodes ( 1981 ) 130 -35 ; frag- ments in Ruschenbusch ( 1966 )), and 'the Laws of Solon' were not revised till 410 -399 , when they were recodified. Neither side was satisfied with Solon's compromise (Solon frr. 34 , 37 ), and the citizen body was soon split into three competing factions ( staseis ): the 'Men of the Plain' (i.e. the plain around Athens) led by Lykourgos, the 'Men beyond the Mountains' (i.e. beyond Hymettos and Pentelikon) led by Peisistratos, and the 'Men of the Coast' led by the Alkmaionid Megakles (Hdt. 1 . 59 . 3 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 13 . 4 ; Andrewes ( 1982 b ) 393 -98 ). In 561 Peisistratos became tyrant in a coup (Hdt. 1 . 59 . 4 -6 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 14 . 1 ). Apart from two long periods of exile, he ruled Athens until 527 (Hdt. 1 . 59 . 3 -64 . 3 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 14 . 1 -17 . 2 ). He was succeeded by his son Hippias ( 527 -510 ), who met gradually increasing opposition from the aristocrats, many of whom were forced into exile (Hdt. 5 . 62 . 2 ; Thuc. 6 . 59 . 4 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 19 . 3 ). Two of those who remained attempted a coup in 514 : the young Harmodios and his lover Aristogeiton tried to murder Hippias at the Panathenaia festival, but succeeded only in killing Hippias' younger brother, Hipparchos. They were instantly put to death (Hdt. 5 . 55 -57 ; Thuc. 6 . 54 -58 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 18 ), and were later regarded as democratic heroes (Thuc. 1 . 20 . 2 , 6 . 53 . 3 ; Ath. 695 B).Statues of the tyrantslayers were put up in 509 and again in 477 (Plin. HN . 34 . 17 ( 509 ); Marm. Par. ( FGrHist 239 ) A 54 ( 477 )), and a cult for Harmodios and Aristogeiton was instituted (Arist. Ath . Pol . 58 . 1 ). In 510 the Peisistratid tyrants were expelled from Athens, but the revolution ended in a power struggle between the returning aristocrats, led by Kleisthenes, and those who had stayed behind, led by Isagoras.With the help of the ordinary people (the demos ), Kleisthenes successfully opposed Isagoras (Hdt. 5 . 66 -73 ), and, reforming the Solonian institutions of 594 , he made Athens a democracy. The term demokratia can be traced back to c. 470 ( SEG 34 199 ; Aesch. Supp . 604 ; Hansen ( 1986 ); contra Raaflaub ( 1998 ) 37 ) and may go back to Kleisthenes' reforms of 508 / 7 (Hdt. 6 . 131 . 1 ). Kleisthenes' major reforms were to divide Attika into 139 municipalities ( demoi ), which in turn were distributed among ten tribes ( phylai ). Citizen rights were linked to membership of a deme, and a Council of Five Hundred was introduced, with fifty representatives from each of the ten tribes and a fixed number of seats assigned to each of the demes (Arist. Ath . Pol . 21 . 2 -6 ). Finally, to avoid a new tyranny (Arist. Ath . Pol . 22 . 3 ) or, rather, to avoid a repeat of the power struggle of 510 -507 , Kleisthenes introduced ostracism (Arist. Ath . Pol . 22 . 1 , 3 -4 ; Brenne ( 2001 ); Siewert ( 2002 )). During the next century the new democracy was buttressed by other reforms: in 501 , command of the army and the navy was transferred from the polemarch to a board of ten popularly elected generals ( strategoi ) (Arist. Ath . Pol . 22 . 2 ). In 487 / 6 the method of selection of the nine archons was changed from election to selection by lot from an elected short list (Arist. Ath . Pol . 22 . 5 ). Ephialtes' reforms of 462 deprived the Council of the Areopagos of its political powers, which were divided between the Assembly ( ekklesia ), the Council of Five Hundred ( boule ) and the People's Court ( dikasterion ) (Arist. Ath . Pol . 25 . 2 ). Shortly afterwards, on the initiative of Perikles, political pay was introduced for the People's Court (Arist. Pol . 1274 a 8 -9 ) and the Council ( IG i³ 82 . 20 ), so that even poor citizens could exercise their political rights. Athenian citizenship became a much-coveted privilege,and in 451 Perikles had a law passed confining citizenship to the legitimate sons of an Athenian mother as well as father (Arist. Ath . Pol . 26 . 4 ; Patterson ( 1981 ); Hansen ( 1985 ) 73 -76 ). The defeats in the Peloponnesian War resulted in a growing opposition to democracy, and twice the anti-democratic factions succeeded for some months in establishing an oligarchy: in 411 an oligarchy led by a Council of Four Hundred (Thuc. 8 . 47 -98 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 29 -33 ; Gomme,Andrewes and Dover ( 1981 ) 153 -256 ), followed by an equally short-lived mixed constitution in 411 / 10 based on 5 , 000 enfranchised citizens (Thuc. 8 . 97 . 1 -2 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 33 . 1 -2 ); and in 404 / 3 a radical oligarchy under a junta which fully earned the name 'the Thirty Tyrants' (Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 -4 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 35 -38 ; Diod. 14 . 3 . 7 ). In 403 / 2 democracy was restored in a modified form (Hansen ( 1999 ) 300 -4 ; contra Bleicken ( 1994 ) 64 -66 ). Legislation (in 403 ) and all jurisdiction in political trials ( c. 355 ) were transferred from the people in assembly to the panel of 6 , 000 jurors acting as both legislators ( nomothetai ) and judges ( dikastai ) (Hansen ( 1999 ) 167 -68 , 181 -83 ). In the 330 s a kind of minister of finance was introduced ( ho epi te dioikesei ) ( SEG 19 119 ). He was elected for a four-year period and could be re-elected, and for twelve consecutive years the administration of Athens was entrusted to Lykourgos (Hyp. fr. 139 , Sauppe; Burke ( 1985 )). Most of these reforms were allegedly a return to the 'ancestral'or 'Solonian'democracy (Andoc. 1 . 83 ; Aeschin. 3 . 257 ; Hansen ( 1999 ) 296 -300 ), but the gradual and moderate transformation of the democratic institutions came to an abrupt end in 322 / 1 when the Makedonians after their victory in the Lamian War abolished the democracy and had it replaced by a 'Solonian'oligarchy (Diod. 18 . 18 . 4 -5 ). After the restoration of democracy in 403 / 2 , more specifically in the age of Demosthenes ( 355 -322 ), the Athenian democracy was organised as follows (Hansen ( 1999 ) 55 -295 ). Political rights were restricted to adult male Athenians. Women, foreigners and slaves were excluded (Dem. 9 . 3 ).An Athenian was inscribed into his father's phratria ( infra 632 ) at the age of 3 or 4 ( P Oxy . 2538 . ii . 24 -28 ), and at the age of 18 he became a member of his father's deme (Arist. Ath . Pol . 42 . 1 ; Dem. 30 . 15 , 39 . 29 ), with his name inscribed in the deme's roster (the lexiarchikon grammateion : Aeschin. 1 . 103 ; Harp. Λ 17 ); but as ephebes, most young Athenians (Lycurg. 1 . 76 ; Hansen ( 1988 ) 3 -6 , ( 1994 ) 302 -4 ; contra Rhodes ( 1981 ) 503 ) were liable for military service for two years (Arist. Ath . Pol . 42 ; Burckhardt ( 1996 ) 26 -75 ) before, at the age of 20 , they could be inscribed in the roster of citizens who had access to the Assembly (the pinax ekklesiastikos : Dem. 44 . 35 ). Full political rights were obtained only at the age of 30 , when a citizen was allowed to present himself as a candidate at the annual sortition of magistrates (Xen. Mem . 1 . 2 . 35 ) and of jurors (Arist. Ath . Pol . 63 . 3 ) (who served both as legislators and as judges). In the People's Assembly (Hansen ( 1987 a )), called he ekklesia , any citizen over 20 years of age had the right to speak and to vote (Xen. Mem . 3 . 6 . 1 ). The people ( demos ) met forty times a year (Arist. Ath . Pol . 43 . 3 ), mostly on the Pnyx hill (Aeschin. 3 . 34 ); a meeting was normally attended by at least 6 , 000 citizens, the quorum required for, among other things, ratification of citizenship decrees (Dem. 59 . 89 ), and a session lasted only a couple of hours (Aeschin. 1 . 112 ). The Assembly was summoned by the fifty prytaneis and chaired by the nine proedroi (Arist. Ath . Pol . 44 . 2 -3 ). Apart from some obligatory items on the agenda, all matters debated by the people had to be debated first in the Council of Five Hundred and passed in the form of a probouleuma (Arist. Ath . Pol . 45 . 4 ). The debate consisted of a number of speeches made by the politically active citizens (Dem. 1 -10 , 13 -16 ), and all votes were taken by a show of hands ( cheirotonia ), assessed by the proedroi without any exact count of the hands (Arist. Ath . Pol . 44 . 3 ). The Athenians distinguished between laws (general and permanent rules, called nomoi ) and decrees (temporary and/or individual rules, called psephismata : Andoc. 1 . 87 ; SEG 26 72 . 55 -56 ( 375 / 4 )). The Assembly was not allowed to pass nomoi (Dem. 1 . 19 , 3 . 10 -11 ) but did, by decree, make decisions on foreign policy and on major issues of domestic policy (Arist. Ath . Pol . 43 . 6 ). Furthermore, the Assembly was empowered (a) to elect the military and financial magistrates (Arist. Ath . Pol . 43 . 1 , 44 . 4 ), (b) to initiate legislation ( nomothesia ) by appointing a panel of legislators ( nomothetai , Dem. 3 . 10 -13 ), and (c) to initiate a political trial ( eisangelia eis ton demon ) by appointing a panel of judges (a dikasterion : Arist. Ath . Pol . 43 . 4 ; Dem. 19 . 116 ). Citizens over 30 years of age were eligible to participate in the annual sortition of a panel of 6 , 000 jurors ( hoi omomokotes : Ar. Vesp . 662 ) who for one year served both as legislators (Dem. 24 . 21 ) and as judges (Dem. 24 . 148 -51 ). When a nomos was to be enacted, the Assembly decreed to appoint for one day a board of, e.g., 1 , 000 legislators ( nomothetai ) selected by lot from the 6 , 000 jurors (Dem. 24 . 20 -38 ; Aeschin. 3 . 38 -40 ). Having listened to a debate, the nomothetai decided by show of hands about all amendments of 'Solon's laws' , i.e. the Solonian law code of 594 / 3 as revised and codified in 403 / 2 (Andoc. 1 . 82 -85 ). Boards of nomothetai were appointed only infrequently, and to legislate once in a month was considered excessive (Dem. 24 . 142 ) (Hansen ( 1999 ) 161 -77 ). Jurisdiction was much more time-consuming (Hansen ( 1999 ) 178 -224 ; T odd ( 1993 )). The People's Court ( dikasterion ) met c. 200 days in a year. On a court day, members of the panel of 6 , 000 jurors came to the agora in the morning, and by sortition from among those who presented themselves were appointed a number of courts, made up of 201 or 401 judges each in private actions and 501 or more in public actions.Each court was presided over by a magistrate,and in a session of some eight hours the judges had to hear and decide either one public action or a number of private actions (Arist. Ath . Pol . 63 -69 ). The two most important types of political trial were the public action against unconstitutional proposals ( graphe paranomon ), against proposers of decrees (Aeschin. 3 . 3 -8 ), and the denunciation to the people in assembly ( eisangelia eis ton demon : Hyp. 3 . 7 -8 ), used most frequently against generals charged with treason and corruption (Dem. 13 . 5 ). In addition to the decision-making organs of government ( ekklesia -nomothetai -dikasterion ), Athens had about 1 , 200 magistrates, called archai (Hansen ( 1999 ) 225 -45 ; Develin ( 1989 )). They were appointed from among citizens over 30 who presented themselves as candidates (Lys. 6 . 4 ). About 100 were elected by the ekklesia (Aeschin. 3 . 14 ), whereas the other 1 , 100 were picked by lot (Dem. 39 . 10 ): viz . 500 councillors and c. 600 other magistrates, often organised in boards of ten with one representative from each tribe ( IG ii² 1388 . 1 -12 ). The period of office was restricted to one year, and magistrates selected by lot could not hold the same office more than once (Arist. Ath . Pol . 62 . 3 ). Prior to entering office, magistrates had to undergo an examination ( dokimasia ) before a dikasterion (Arist. Ath . Pol . 55 . 2 -5 ) and, when their term of office expired, they had to render accounts ( euthynai ) before another dikasterion (Arist. Ath . Pol . 54 . 2 , 48 . 4 -5 ). The magistrates' principal tasks were to summon and preside over the decision-making bodies and to see to the execution of the decisions made (Arist. Pol . 1322 b 12 -17 ). Apart from routine matters, the magistrates could not decide anything but only prepare the decisions (Arist. Pol . 1298 a 28 -32 ). The Council of Five Hundred prepared business for the ekklesia (Arist. Ath . Pol . 45 . 4 ) and the nomothetai (Dem. 24 . 48 ), the other magistrates for the dikasteria (Aeschin. 3 . 29 ). By far the most important board of magistrates was the Council of Five Hundred, called he boule hoi pentakosioi (Andoc. 1 . 96 ; Rhodes ( 1972 )). It was composed of fifty persons from each of the ten phylai , who for a tenth of the year (a prytany of 36 or 35 days) served as prytaneis , i.e. as an executive committee of the Council, which in turn served as an executive committee of the Assembly. The Council met every day except holidays in the bouleuterion on the agora to run the financial administration of Athens and to consider in advance every matter to be put before the demos (Arist. Ath . Pol . 43 . 2 -49 . 5 ). Of the other boards of magistrates, the most important were the ten generals ( strategoi ) who commanded the Athenian army and navy (Arist. Ath . Pol . 61 . 1 -2 ; Hamel ( 1998 )); the Board for the Theoric Fund ( hoi epi to theorikon ), who in the 350 s under Euboulos supervised the Athenian financial administration (Aeschin. 3 . 24 -25 ); and the nine archons who in most public and private actions had to summon and preside over the People's Court and supervised the major festivals, e.g. the Panathenaia and the Dionysia (Arist. Ath . Pol . 55 -59 ). In all matters the initiative was left to the individual citizen, in this capacity called ton Athenaion ho boulomenos hois exestin ( SEG 26 72 . 34 ; Hansen ( 1999 ) 26...

362,Eleusis,Attika,38.05,23.35,738,3816,"362 . Eleusis Map 59 . Lat. 38 . 05 , long. 23 . 35 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: B. The toponym is ' Ελευσίς , -ῖνος , ηasper (Arist. Ath . Pol . 39 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 2 . 4 . 43 ; Diod. 14 . 35 . 6 ). No city-ethnic is attested, but the official name of the polity seems to have been οιasper Αθηναῖοι οιasper ' Ελευσῖνι κατοικουtildeντες (Arist. Ath . Pol . 39 . 2 , 5 , 40 . 4 ). There is no reason to assume that Eleusis was a polis in the early Archaic period, but in the years 403 -401 it was a self-governing polity settled with the core of the oligarchic faction in the civil war 404 / 3 . It is not called a polis in any source, but it seems to have had the same status as a klerouchy. The Eleusinians remained Athenian citizens and are described as epitimoi and Athenaioi . The official name of the polity seems to have been οιasper Αθηναῖοι οιasper ' Ελευσῖνι κατοικουtildeντες ( supra ), just as the C4 klerouchs in Poteidaia were called οιasper Αθηναῖοι οιasper εν ΠοτειδαίΩsubiotaα κατοικουtildeντες (Dem. 7 . 10 ). Like klerouchs, they could return to Athens and reactivate their full Athenian citizenship. Considering the full self-government enjoyed by the community, Eleusis in 403 -401 must be included in this inventory as a polis type B. During the oligarchic regime in 404 / 3 , the Thirty wanted to secure Eleusis for themselves as a possible refuge and had many of the Eleusinians executed (Xen. Hell . 2 . 4 . 8 -10 ). In connection with the restoration of the democracy in 403 , it was decided that those of the oligarchs from Athens who so wished could leave Athens and have Eleusis as their residence alongside those of the Eleusinians whom they wanted to retain. Thus, the new polis was created by a synoecism of oligarchs from both communities (Arist. Ath . Pol . 39 . 3 : συνοικεῖν ). The oligarchs in Eleusis were banned from Athens, and the democrats in Athens from Eleusis. The Eleusinian oligarchs were still Athenian citizens ( επίτι µ οι ), but self-governing ( κυρίους καιgrave αυτοκράτορας εasperαυτῶν καιgrave ταgrave εasperαυτῶν καρπου µ ένους ). They were explicitly banned from holding office in Athens, unless they left Eleusis and registered as ordinary Athenian citizens once again. Eleusis was to be a member of the Peloponnesian League like Athens, and the Eleusinians and Athenians were to share the Eleusinian sanctuary and the mysteries (Arist. Ath . Pol . 39 . 1 -5 ; Diod. 14 . 35 . 6 ; Cloché ( 1915 ) 256 -59 , 278 -95 ; Loening ( 1987 )). Soon afterwards it was reported to Athens that the oligarchs in Eleusis had begun to hire mercenaries (Xen. Hell . 2 . 4 . 43 ), and, according to a late source (Just. Epit . 5 . 10 . 8 -11 ), they even attacked Athens. In 401 / 0 (Arist. Ath . Pol . 40 . 4 ) the Athenians marched out in full force (Xen. Hell . 2 . 4 . 43 ) and laid siege to Eleusis (Lys. 25 . 9 ). Some of the oligarchs deserted and joined the Athenian democrats (ibid.). During a meeting between the two sides, the Athenians killed the Eleusinian strategoi and persuaded the Eleusinians to give up Eleusis and move back to Athens, where a new amnesty was declared (Xen. Hell . 2 . 4 . 43 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 40 . 4 ). The bronze coins struck in C4 -C3 and inscribed ΕΛΕΥΣΙ were for the requirements of the Eleusinian festivals and have no relation to the oligarchic polis of 403 -401 . Types: obv . Triptolemos in winged car drawn by snakes; rev . pig standing on bacchos. Legend: ΕΛΕΥΣΙ and, on one, ΑΘΕ (Head, HN ² 391 ; SNG Cop. Attica 414 -19 ). The legend is probably an abbreviated form not of the ethnic ΕΛΕΥΣΙ ( ΝΙΩΝ ) but of the ktetikon ΕΛΕΥΣΙ ( ΝΙΑΚΟΝ ), and the coin inscribed ΑΘΕ reveals that such coins were struck by the Athenian mint for the festival of the Mysteries, not by the Eleusinians (Kroll and Walker ( 1993 ) 26 -28 )."
363,Salamis (Salaminios),Attika,38.0,23.35,1595,7729,"363 . Salamis (Salaminios) Map. 59 . Lat. 38 . 00 , long. 23 . 35 . Size of territory: 2 ( 93 km ² ). Type: A. The toponyn is Σαλα µ ίς , -ῖνος , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 557 ; Aesch. Pers . 273 ; Thuc. 2 . 93 . 4 ; IG i³ 1 . 2 (C6l)), denoting both the island (Hdt. 8 . 76 . 2 ) and the town (Ps.-Skylax 57 ; cf. Strabo 9 . 1 . 9 ). An older toponym is Κυχρεία (Aesch. Pers . 570 ; SEG 26 121 . 32 (C1l); Strabo 9 . 1 . 9 ). The city-ethnic is Σαλα µ ίνιος ( IG i³ 748 (C5e); Dem. 19 . 251 ). Salamis is called a polis in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 57 , and in the territorial sense (but in a mythological context) at Cratinus fr. 246 . Salamis is called the metropolis of Cypriote Salamis at Aesch. Pers . 894 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is probably attested internally in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ) and externally in an Athenian decree of C4l ( IG ii² 1260 . 19 ) and in literature (Aeschin. 1 . 25 ; Dem. 19 . 251 ). The individual use is attested internally in sepulchral monuments found on Salamis ( IG ii² 10173 , undated) and externally in those found in Attika ( IG ii² 10176 (C4m)) and in literary sources ( Λέων οasper Σαλα µ ίνιος , killed by the Thirty in 404 (Xen. Hell . 2 . 3 . 39 )). In C6e a war between Athens and Megara over Salamis (Solon frr. 1 -3 , West; Plut. Sol . 8 ) ended with an Athenian victory and the conquest of Salamis. The credit for the victory goes in some sources to Solon (Plut. Sol . 9 ; Dem. 19 . 251 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 17 . 2 ), in others to Peisistratos (Aen. Tact. 4 . 8 -12 ). During the stasis in C6f Athens seems to have lost Salamis once again to the Megarians (Plut. Sol . 12 . 5 ), and the dispute over Salamis was eventually submitted to Lakedaimonian arbitration. The Athenians seem to have invoked an allegedly interpolated line about the Athenians in the Homeric Catalogue of Ships ( Il . 2 . 558 ), and the Lakedaimonians found for the Athenians (Plut. Sol . 10 ; Arist. Rh . 1375 a 29 -30 ). In the sources the Athenian side was represented by either Solon or Peisisteros (Strabo 9 . 1 . 10 ), but modern historians prefer a date of c. 520 -510 , associating the Lakedaimonian arbitrator Kleomenes (Plut. Sol . 10 . 6 ) with King Kleomenes of Sparta. For a full account, see Taylor ( 1997 ) 21 -47 . In C6l Salamis was settled with a contingent of Athenians who were liable to pay taxes and give military service to Athens ( IG i³ 1 ). The commonly accepted view is that these Athenians were klerouchs, although perhaps of a peculiar kind (Cargill ( 1995 ) pp. xxiv, 60 ; for a different view see Taylor ( 1997 ) 63 -74 ). The only explicit evidence is schol. Pind. Nem . 2 . 19 . In the C6l Athenian decree concerning Salamis, τ [ οgraveς ε Σ ] αλα µ [ ῖνι κλερόχ ] ος has been restored by most editors ( IG i³ 1 . 1 = ML 14 ; Koerner ( 1993 ) 1 ). More important is that a lease of confiscated property on Lemnos of 387 / 6 compares 'klerouchs on Lemnos' to 'those on Salamis' ( Agora xix L 3 . 33 -34 : γηtildeν τοgraveς κλερόχος καιgrave [----καθά ] περ τοῖς ες Σαλα µ [ ῖνα ]. And in an honorary inscription of c. 325 , Αθηναίων οasper δηtilde µ ος οasper εν Σαλα µ ῖνι appears alongside Αθηναίων οasper δηtilde µ ος οasper εν /acute Ι µ βρωι ( IG ii² 3206 ; SEG 46 261 ; cf., however, Salomon ( 1997 ) 96 -101 ). The epigraphic evidence, principally sepulchral monuments, shows that, in addition to metics and slaves ( IG ii² 1570 . ii . 42 ( c. 330 )), the population of Salamis consisted partly of Athenians registered with their demotics and partly of so-called Salaminioi. A good many tombstones found on Salamis commemorate Athenians with ordinary demotics ( IG ii² 7101 (C4 , etc.); Lys. 13 . 44 ; see Taylor ( 1997 ) 267 -316 , nos. 9 , 10 , 16 , 18 , 29 , etc.). Some two score tombstones with known provenance were set over Salaminioi; a few were found on Salamis, but the majority in Attika ( IG ii² 10171 -215 with addenda in Taylor ( 1997 ) 263 -316 ). Who these Salaminians were is still a moot point. No link can be established between the genos of the Salaminioi attested in Athens in C4 ( IG ii² 1232 (C4l); Agora xix L 4 a ( 363 / 2 )) and the Salaminioi who were named after the island of Salamis (Taylor ( 1997 ) 47 -63 ; Parker ( 1996 ) 312 ). Salaminians named after the island of Salamis must be distinguished from Salaminioi from the polis on Cyprus. The latter are sometimes specified as being Σαλα µ ίνιοι αποgrave Κυacuteπρου ( IG ii² 10217 -18 (C4 )). Pace Taylor ( 1997 ) 136 , 264 , it is unbelievable that all the tombstones found in Attika commemorate Salaminioi from Cypriot Salamis.Most of them,perhaps all, are probably Salaminioi from the island in the Saronic Gulf (so also Osborne and Byrne ( 1996 ) 272 -76 ). Finally, in spite of all the prosopographical information we possess, there is not one single attestation of a person who is recorded both as a Salaminian and as belonging to one of the Athenian demes. The only evidence of an Athenian who is both a Salaminian and a member of a deme is Moirokles of Eleusis ( SEG 28 103 . 6 -7 ( 332 / 1 ); cf. SEG 31 109 A), who is presumably identical with Μοιροκληtildeς Σαλα µ ίνιος at Harp. Μ 36 . He may be a Salaminios naturalised by the Athenians, like ' Ηρακλείδης οasper Κλαζο µ ένιος (Arist. Ath . Pol . 41 . 3 ), or he may be one of the Athenians living on Salamis. The sources do not support Taylor's view that the ethnic Salaminios designates a full Athenian citizen who happens to reside on Salamis and that all Salaminians were inscribed in the 139 demes (( 1997 ) 123 -58 ). The population of Salamis was probably divided into Salaminians and Athenians (for a parallel, see IG xii . 8 668 , a decree mentioning side by side the Athenian demos ( sc . on Skyros) and those who live on Skyros, infra 774 ). The presumption is that the so-called Salaminians were never integrated into the Athenian state. They had no representation in the Council of Five Hundred, and never filled any other Athenian office (Develin ( 1989 )); they are not attested as jurors in the People's Court (Kroll ( 1972 )), and were presumably excluded from the ekklesia as well. Both groups were entitled to pass decrees, both the demos of the Athenians on Salamis ( IG ii² 3206 ( c. 325 )) and the demos of the Salaminians ( IG ii² 1260 . 19 (C4l); IG ii² 1225 . 4 (C3m)). The eponymous official was the άρχων εις Σαλα µ ῖνα ( IG i³ 1 . 7 -12 (C6l); IG ii² 3093 (C4e); IG ii² 1227 . 1 (C2s)), who was an Athenian magistrate, selected by lot (Arist. Ath . Pol . 54 . 8 ) and paid by the Athenians ( Ath . Pol . 62 . 2 ) like other overseas magistrates. The rural Dionysia were celebrated on Salamis (Arist. Ath . Pol . 54 . 8 ; IG ii² 3093 (C4e)), and there were cults of the nymph Salamis ( IG ii² 1955 ( c. 320 ); obv . of C4 coins ( infra )), of Aias (Hdt. 8 . 64 . 2 ; SEG 26 121 . 32 (C1l); rev . of C4 coins ( infra )), and of Athena Skiras (Hdt. 8 . 94 . 2 ). The town was situated on the eastern side of the island, north of Kynousura. It was fortified, but the C4 circuit wall was rebuilt in C3m ( IG ii² 1225 . 11 -12 ) and later, but today only the faint outline of the walls can be observed (Haider ( 1989 ) 596 ). In the town was an agora with a C4e statue of Solon (Aeschin. 1 . 25 ; Dem. 19 . 251 ) and one of three monuments commemorating the battle of 480 (Paus. 1 . 36 . 1 ; schol. Aesch. Pers . 303 ; Lycurg. 1 . 73 ; IG ii² 1228 . 27 -28 (C1 )); another was on Kynousura, where remains of it were seen by Stewart and Revett (Hammond ( 1973 ) 304 -10 ). On the north-west tip of the island at Boudoron was a fortress mentioned in connection with the Peloponnesian raid on Salamis in 429 / 8 (Thuc. 2 . 93 . 4 , 94 . 3 , cf. 3 . 51 . 2 ). ## II. The Poleis"
364,Athenai Diades (Athenites),Euboia,38.5,23.0,803,3763,"364 . Athenai Diades (Athenites) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 50 , long. 23 . 00 . Size of territory: 1 ? Type: [A]. The toponym is Αθηtildeναι ∆ιάδες , αιasper (Aesch.fr. 61 , Mette; IG i³ 268 . v . 28 ; Strabo 10 . 1 . 5 ). The city-ethnic is Αθηνίτης ( IG i³ 71 . i . 79 ; IG ii² 43 . 90 ) or, once, Αθηνήτης (Eratosthenes fr. iii B 102 , Berger) or Αθηναῖος ( IG i³ 264 . iv . 20 ). Athenai Diades is called a polis in the urban sense by Ephor. fr. 24 , but only in a mythological context: Ephoros states that the polis was founded by Dias, the son of Abas. The political sense is attested in IG ii² 43 . 78 and 90 , where the Athenitai under the heading πόλεις are listed as members of the Second Athenian Naval League. The collective and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in the Athenian tribute lists ( supra ). In C3m the ethnic appears as a demotic ( IG xii . 9 1186 . 2 ). According to Strabo 10 . 1 . 5 , Athenai Diades was situated at Cape Kenaion near Oreos. However, the urban centre has not yet been precisely located. Ulrichs ( 1863 ) 237 identified Athenai Diades with Dion (no. 368 ) and suggested a location at modern Lichas. The separate listing of Dion and Athenai Diades in the Athenian tribute lists disproves the identification, and, following Vischer ( 1857 ) 661 , the prevailing view is that Athenai Diades should be identified with the hill of Kastelli at Gialtra Loutra (Sackett et al . ( 1966 ) 37 no. 3 ). Nothing is known about the size of the territory; but since the Kenaion peninsula accommodated both Athenai Diades and Dion, the territory can hardly have exceeded 25 km ² . The hill of Kastelli at Gialtra Loutra has never been excavated. It seems appropriate for an acropolis, and remains of walls can be seen at various places. Surface finds indicate that the site was settled continuously from the Neolithic until the Roman period (Sackett et al . ( 1966 ) 37 no. 3 ; Reber ( 2001 ) 456 fig. 13 ). Athenai Diades was a member of the Delian League and may have been among the original members ( ATL iii. 198 -99 ). It belonged to the Island district ( IG i³ 269 . v . 26 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists mostly by toponym ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 32 ) but sometimes by city-ethnic ( IG i³ 279 . i . 85 ) from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . iii . 26 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 12 ), a total of thirteen times, three times completely restored, paying a phoros of 2 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 264 . iv . 20 ) raised to 4 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 268 . v . 28 ) in, probably, 445 / 4 ( IG i³ 267 . iv . 28 ), reduced to 2 , 000 dr. in 443 / 2 ( IG i³ 269 . v . 26 ) and raised again to 4 , 000 dr.in 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 12 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 79 ( 1 tal.)). Athenai Diades (and Dion (no. 368 )) are attested as dependencies of Histiaia/Oreos (no. 372 ) in the last decade of C5 ( IG xii . 9 188 . 18 -19 = Staatsverträge 205 : post-411 ; Knoepfler ( 2001 ) nn. 338 -39 : post-404 ). Athenai Diades must have recovered its independence in C4e since it is recorded among the original members of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 . 90 ), whereas the Histiaians are recorded somewhat later (B 18 ). The Athenitai may have left the League together with Thebes (no. 221 ) in 371 or shortly afterwards (Dreher ( 1995 ) 173 ). Thus the presumption is that Athenai Diades was a polis in the political sense down to C4f. In Ps.-Skylax 58 , however, Euboia is described as a tetrapolis , cf. Dem. 23 . 213 and lines 14 -15 of IG ii² 124 which seem to presuppose a total of four poleis on Euboia in 357 . The inference is that by C4m Athenai must have been incorporated into Histiaia/Oreos (no. 372 ) (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 352 ), and in C3m it is duly attested as a Histiaian deme ( IG xii . 9 1186 . 2 )."
365,Chalkis (Chalkideus),Euboia,38.25,23.35,2702,13009,"365 . Chalkis (Chalkideus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 25 , long. 23 . 35 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A. The toponym is Χαλκίς , -ίδος , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 537 ; Hecat. fr. 129 ; Aeschin. 3 . 89 ; IG i³ 41 . 71 ). In order to distinguish Euboian Chalkis from homonymous cities, it is sometimes called Χαλκίς ηasper εν ΕυρίπΩsubiotaω (Aen. Tact. 4 . 1 ). According to Hecat. fr. 129 the toponym was originally Ευacuteβοια , perhaps to be identified with modern Lefkandi (Bakhuizen ( 1985 ) 96 ). The city-ethnic is Χαλκιδευacuteς (Aeschin. 3 . 89 ; CEG 179 . 3 ( c. 505 )), sometimes further specified: Χαλκιδευacuteς τῶν απ ' Ευρίπου ( IG xii . 6 42 . 15 (C4l)) or Χαλκιδεῖς οιasper εξ Ευβοίας (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 17 ). Chalkis is called a polis both in the political sense ( IG i³ 40 . 5 ; IG ii² 44 . 14 ; Philiskos fr. 3 , CGF ) and in the urban sense (Hecat. fr. 129 ; Eur. Iph. Aul . 168 ; Aen. Tact. 4 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 58 ). The collective use of the the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on C6 -C5 coins ( infra ) and externally in inscriptions ( CEG 179 . 3 ; IG i³ 40 . 5 , 21 ) and in literary sources (Hdt. 5 . 99 ; Arist. Pol . 1289 b 39 ). The individual and external use is attested in inscriptions ( CID ii 31 . 79 ( 345 / 4 )) and in literary sources (Aeschin. 3 . 89 ). The territory of Chalkis is called ηasper εν ΕυβοίΩsubiotaα Χαλκιδική (Arist. Hist. an . 496 b 25 -26 ). To the south Chalkis bordered on Eretria (no. 370 ), and according to Bakhuizen ( 1985 ) 127 -31 the frontier followed the mountain ridge of Voudochi, Olympos, Xirovouni and Skoteini, ending at modern Kimi.According to Knoepfler,however,it ran east of the river Lelantos,and the territory of Chalkis included Argoura,now located south of the river (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 353 ; cf. ( 1981 )). To the north Chalkis bordered on Histiaia/Oreos (no. 372 ). The frontier was at Mts. Kandili and Pyxaria (Bakhuizen ( 1985 ) 127 -31 ), but, at least in the Archaic period, the territory included Kerinthos north of Pyxaria (Thgn. 891 -94 ; Gehrke ( 1994 ) 336 -39 ; Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 352 -53 with n. 10 ) but not Elymnion (Gehrke ( 1994 ) 339 -40 ; Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 418 with n. 102 ). In C4 it covered c. 825 km ² . Part of Euboia was called ∆ιακρία ( Etym. Magn . 268 . 3 ; schol. Lycoph. Alex . 374 ), presumably to be located in Chalkidian territory north-east of Chalkis (Geyer ( 1903 ) 45 ; Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 376 with n. 194 ). This region seems, at least in C5 , to have been the home of two different communities, which, in the Athenian tribute lists, are recorded separately from the Χαλκιδ ˜ ες ( IG i³ 71 . i . 71 ), sc . the ∆ιακρ ˜ ες αποgrave Χαλκιδέον (no. 367 ; IG i³ 71 . i . 83 -84 ) and the ∆ιάκριοι εν Ευβοίαι (no. 366 ) ( IG i³ 71 . i . 93 -94 ); see infra 650 . Like most other Euboian poleis , Chalkis was subdivided into demoi , of which only one is attested: a Delphian decree of c. 315 -285 ( F.Delphes iii . 1 424 . 1 -2 ) bestows proxeny on [Kl]eochares of Chalkis of the deme of Aigai, ( δή µ ου Αι [ γ ] αίων , a restoration of ΛΙ . ΛΙΩΝ ; cf. Strabo 8 . 7 . 4 , 9 . 2 . 13 ; see Jones, POAG 73 ; Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 406 n. 11 ). Next to nothing is known about the history of Chalkis before 506 . Apart from colonisation ( infra 649 ), the only event reported in the sources is the semi-mythical Lelantine War, fought in C8s or C7f between Eretria (no. 370 ) and Chalkis and their allies over the possession of the Lelantine Plain (Parker ( 1997 ); infra 652 ). In 506 the Chalkidians joined the Peloponnesians and the Boiotians in an abortive attack on Athens (no. 361 ) (Hdt. 5 . 74 . 2 ). The Athenians then invaded Euboia and inflicted a defeat on the Chalkidians; they confiscated the land belonging to the hippobotai and gave it to 4 , 000 klerouchs (Hdt. 5 . 77 ; CEG 179 ). In 480 the Athenians handed over twenty hulls of triremes to the Chalkidians on which they fought in the battles of Artemision (Hdt. 8 . 1 . 2 ) and Salamis (Hdt. 8 . 46 . 2 ). They are recorded on the Serpent Column (ML 27 . 8 ). Chalkis was a member of the Delian League, and may have been among the original members ( ATL iii. 198 -99 ). It belonged to the Island district ( IG i³ 269 . v . 31 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 448 / 7 ( IG i³ 264 . iv . 23 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 31 , partly restored), a total of eleven times, three times completely restored, paying a phoros of 5 tal. in 448 / 7 ( IG i³ 264 . iv . 23 ), reduced ( sic ) to 3 tal. after the revolt of 446 ( IG i³ 270 . v . 32 ( 442 / 1 )). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 71 , 10 tal.), and in 413 Chalkis was still listed among the paying members (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 4 ). In 446 Chalkis defected from Athens; but the revolt was quenched by an Athenian army under Perikles (Thuc. 1 . 114 . 1 -3 ; Plut. Per . 23 . 4 ). Chalkis may have defected once again in 424 / 3 together with other Euboian poleis (Philoch. fr. 130 ). The treaty between Athens and Chalkis ( IG i³ 40 ) by which Chalkis was brought back into the League may belong in either year. It is dated to 446 / 5 in IG i³ but to 424 / 3 by Mattingly ( 1996 ) 53 -67 , 161 -62 , 372 -77 , 391 -94 . The treaty prescribed that the Chalkidians swear loyalty towards Athens ( 21 -23 ) and give hostages ( 47 ); moreover, their self-government in administration of justice was restricted in matters punishable by death, exile or loss of rights ( 74 -76 ); cf. Balcer ( 1978 ). Chalkis was still loyal to Athens in 411 (Thuc. 8 . 95 . 6 ) but defected after the Athenian defeat at Eretria (Thuc. 8 . 95 . 7 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 33 . 1 ; Diod. 13 . 47 . 3 ). During the rule of the Thirty, many Athenian democrats fled to Chalkis (Lys. 24 . 25 ). Chalkis was among the original members of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 . 80 ; Diod. 15 . 30 . 1 ), and a treaty between Athens and Chalkis was concluded in 378 / 7 ( IG ii² 44 ). But together with Thebes (no. 221 ) and the other Euboian poleis , Chalkis left the League in 371 (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 23 ; Dreher ( 1995 ) 173 ) and fought against the Athenians at Mantinea in 362 (Diod. 15 . 85 . 2 , 6 ). In 357 , Chalkis was torn by stasis between a pro-Theban and a pro-Athenian faction (Aeschin. 3 . 85 -86 ; Diod. 16 . 7 . 2 ), and was presumably conquered by exiles operating from Eretria (Aen. Tact. 4 . 1 -4 ). Both the Thebans and the Athenians invaded Euboia; the Thebans were expelled from Euboia (Dem. 22 . 14 ); a new treaty was concluded, and Chalkis rejoined the Naval League ( IG ii² 124 . 16 , 147 ; Aeschin. 3 . 85 ). In 349 / 8 an Athenian army under Phokion was sent to assist Ploutarchos of Eretria. It landed at Argoura on Chalkidian territory (Dem. 21 . 132 ) and was opposed by an Euboian army under Kallias of Chalkis (Aeschin. 3 . 86 -87 ). Phokion won the battle of Tamynai (Aeschin. 2 . 169 -70 ; Plut. Phoc . 12 -13 ), a peace was concluded, and Chalkis rejoined the Naval League ( IG ii² 125 ; Aeschin. 2 . 12 , 3 . 88 ). In 340 some kind of short-lived league with a common council was established under the leadership of Kallias of Chalkis (Aeschin. 3 . 89 , 94 ; Staatsverträge 342 ); it included Chalkis, Eretria (no. 370 ) and Histiaia/Oreos (no. 372 ). Because of the contemporary issue of a common Euboian coinage ( supra 643 ; infra ) the union has sometimes been interpreted as a federation ( Staatsverträge 342 ; Picard ( 1979 )), but see Beck ( 1997 ) 28 . The constitution of Chalkis (Gehrke, Stasis 37 -41 ) was among the 158 politeiai described by Aristotle and his pupils (frr. 618 -20 ). In the Archaic period oligarchy alternated with tyranny (Arist. Pol . 1316 a 31 -32 ; Hes. Op . 654 -57 ), and in one case a tyranny may even have been followed by what Aristotle classifies as a democracy (Arist. Pol . 1304 a 29 -31 ; see Aubonnet ad loc . and LGPN i s.v. Φόξος ). In C6l Chalkis was an oligarchy governed by a class of hippobotai (Arist. Pol . 1289 b 36 -39 ; Hdt. 77 . 2 ), in another context described as an aristocracy based on a census requirement (Arist. fr. 618 ). After the Athenian victory in 506 , the hippobotai were expelled, and their property handed over to 4 , 000 Athenian klerouchs (Hdt. 5 . 77 . 2 ). A brief democratic interlude may have followed (Thgn. 893 -94 ); but the hippobotai returned when the Athenian klerouchs were withdrawn in 490 in connection with the Persian invasion of Euboia (Hdt. 6 . 100 ), and they were still in power when Perikles invaded Euboia in 446 (Plut. Per . 23 . 4 ). After the surrender of Chalkis, the hippobotai 's property was confiscated, divided into 2 , 000 kleroi and given to, probably, the other Chalkidians and some foreigners (Ael. VH 6 . 1 ). It is unlikely that the Athenians sent klerouchs to Chalkis as they did to Histiaia/Oreos (no. 372 ) (Figueira ( 1991 ) 256 -60 ). There is no direct evidence, but the ensuing treaty between Athens and Chalkis ( IG i³ 40 ) indicates that from now on Chalkis had a democratic constitution (Gehrke, Stasis 40 ). In 357 there may have been an outbreak of stasis in Chalkis as there was in the other Euboian poleis (Diod. 16 . 7 . 2 ). In the 340 s Chalkis was ruled by Mnesarchos and his sons, Taurosthenes and, especially, Kallias. They were probably democratic leaders, and there is no reason to trust Aischines'allegation that they were tyrants ( 3 . 89 , 92 ). Both obtained Athenian citizenship (Hyp. 1 . 20 ; Din 1 . 44 ), probably in 341 / 40 (Osborne ( 1983 ) T 73 ). Together with the other Euboian poleis , Chalkis was a member of the Amphictyonic League (Lefèvre ( 1998 ) 59 -63 ) and provided in some years one of the two Ionian hieromnemones ( CID ii 32 . 44 ; 74 . i . 34 -35 ). Athenian envoys were sent to Chalkis ( IG ii² 124 . 16 ), and Chalkidian envoys were sent to Athens ( IG i³ 40 . 12 -17 ; IG ii² 44 . 8 ; Aeschin. 3 . 91 ). Nopublic enactment antedating the Heltic period is preserved and the only attested political institution is a boule referred to as a decision-making institution in 446 / 5 ( IG i³ 40 . 62 -63 ). The only cults attested in classical sources are those of Zeus Olympios ( IG i³ 40 . 35 , 61 -62 ) and Athena ( IG ii² 44 . 17 ). Two Chalkidian citizens are attested as victors in the Olympic Games ( Olympionikai 121 in 532 and 459 in 332 ) and one in the Pythian games (Plin. HN 35 . 35 (C5 )). In C4m Chalkis was a walled city with an agora (Aen. Tact. 4 . 1 -4 ; cf. Strabo 10 . 1 . 8 (r 334 )) and, in the agora, a funeral monument of C6 ? set over Kleomachos of Pharsalos (Plut. Mor . 761 A; Bakhuizen ( 1985 ) 24 -25 ). The acropolis was at Mt. Vathrovoúnia in the south-east part of the city. The acropolis and part of the city as well were protected by a C4e circuit wall of c. 2 km enclosing an area of c. 12 . 5 ha. In 411 the town of Chalkis was connected with the mainland by a bridge, and in 334 a fortress was erected on a hill immediately west of the bridge near Aulis (Diod. 13 . 47 . 3 -6 ; Strabo 10 . 1 . 8 ; Bakhuizen ( 1985 ) 48 -52 ). The harbour is mentioned at Ps.Skylax 58 ; cf. Thuc. 8 . 95 . 6 . At Chalkis there are a number of natural harbours, but no ancient remains have been found (Bakhuizen ( 1985 ) 54 -57 ). A rock on the Kallimani hill is inscribed ΦΟΙ : ΟΡΟΣ , probably a boundary mark of C4e ( ArchDelt 31 ( 1976 ) 147 ). Chalkis struck silver coins c. 550 -506 , c. 490 -465 , and coins of silver and bronze c. 337 -308 . Coins were struck first on the Euboic standard (tridrachm, drachm, hemidrachm), later on the Attic standard (tetradrachm, didrachm and tetrobol). ( 1 ) Silver C6 : obv . facing quadriga (tridrachm) or facing horseman and horse (drachm) or facing horseman (hemidrachm); rev . incuse of mill-sail pattern. ( 2 ) Silver C6 -C5 : obv . eagle in flight, sometimes carrying a snake; rev . wheel in square or triangular incuse. Legend: ΨΑΛ . ( 3 ) A small issue of tetradrachms of probably 506 has obv . Boiotian shield. Legend: Ψ . Rev . wheel of Chalkis (Kraay ( 1976 ) 90 ). ( 4 ) Silver (drachm, hemidrachm, obol, hemiobol) and bronze 337 -308 ; obv . head of the nymph Chalkis (silver) or bust of Hera (bronze); rev . eagle carrying a snake. Legend: ΧΑΛ (Picard ( 1979 ) 16 -54 ). ( 5 ) 'Federal' issues of C4 . Silver (tetradrachm, didrachm, drachm): obv . head of nymph Euboia; rev . bull. Bronze: obv . head of nymph Euboia or bull; rev . grapes. Legend: ΕΥ or ΕΥΒ (Head, HN ² 357 -59 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) 89 -91 ; SNG Cop. AetoliaEuboea 432 -46 ; for the 'federal' issues, see Wallace ( 1956 ); Kraay ( 1976 ) 93 ; Picard ( 1979 ); Brunner ( 1998 )). Chalkis was involved in the colonisation of Naxos (no. 41 ), Zankle (no. 51 ), Kyme (no. 57 ), Neapolis (no. 63 ), Pithekoussai (no. 65 ), Rhegion (no. 68 ), Kleonai (no. 580 ) and possibly Skiathos (no. 520 ). Furthermore, on the basis primarily of onomastic similarity, Chalkis is often assumed to have been heavily involved in the colonisation of the Chalkidic peninsula; see further Flensted-Jensen ( 1998 ) 57 -70 with refs. and ( 2000 ) 125 -31 with refs."
366,Diakrioi en Euboia,Euboia,,,252,1133,"366 . Diakrioi en Euboia Map 55 . Unlocated, not in Barr . Type: C. ∆ιακρία ( Etym. Magn . 268 . 3 ) or ∆ιάκρια (schol. Lycoph. Alex . 374 ) denotes the Euboian mountain district north-east of Chalkis (no. 365 ) (Bakhuizen ( 1985 ) 141 n. 49 ). This region was inhabited by the ∆ιάκριοι ( IG i³ 71 . i . 94 ; Lycoph. Alex . 375 ) and the ∆ιακρ ˜ ες (no. 367 ) ( IG i³ 71 . i . 83 ; see supra 643 ). The ∆ιάκριοι εν Ευβοίαι were members of the Delian League. They belonged to the Island district ( IG i³ 71 . i . 93 -94 ) and are recorded twice in the tribute lists, in 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . iii . 24 ) and in 417 / 16 ( IG i³ 288 . i . 2 -3 ), in both cases heavily but plausibly restored, paying a phoros of 1 tal. and 2 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 282 . iii . 24 ). They were assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 94 : 1 tal., 2 , 000 dr.). Membership of the Delian League indicates that the Diakrioi constituted a self-governing political community, but there is no indication that it was centred on a nucleated settlement. For the possible identification of the Diakrioi en Euboia with the Eretrian deme of Peraia, see no. 375 ."
367,Diakres apo Chalkideon,Euboia,,,275,1260,"367 . Diakres apo Chalkideon Map 55 . Unlocated. Type: [A]. On Diakria, see no. 366 . The Athenian assessment decree of 425 / 4 records both the ∆ιακρ ˜ ες αποgrave Χαλκιδέον ( IG i³ 71 . i . 83 -84 ) and the ∆ιάκριοι εν Ευβοίαι (no. 366 ) ( IG i³ 71 . i . 93 -94 ). The Diakres must accordingly have been different from the Diakrioi, and formed perhaps a shortlived splinter community of Chalkis (no. 365 ) settled in the Diakria in the northern part of the territory of Chalkis in the years after 446 when Chalkis was controlled by Athens (no. 361 ) (Geyer ( 1924 ) 224 ). The Diakres are recorded in the tribute lists from 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 25 -26 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 15 -16 ), a total of six times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of first 800 dr. ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 25 ) but 3 , 000 dr. in 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 15 -16 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 83 -84 : 2 , 000 dr.). In 434 / 3 the Diakres appear as the fourth of thirteen communities listed under the heading πόλες ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 18 and 25 -26 ). Membership of the Delian League indicates that the Diakres constituted a self-governing political community, but there is no indication that it was centred on a nucleated settlement."
368,Dion (Dieus),Euboia,38.5,22.5,769,3679,"368 . Dion (Dieus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 50 , long. 22 . 50 . Size of territory: 1 ? Type: [A]. The toponym is ∆ῖον , τό (Hom. Il . 2 . 538 ; Strabo 10 . 1 . 5 ; Steph. Byz. 232 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is ∆ιευacuteς ( IG ii² 43 . 88 ). Apart from πτολίεθρον at Hom. Il . 2 . 538 , Steph. Byz. is the only source in which Dion explicitly is called a polis ; but the political sense is implicitly attested in IG ii² 43 . 78 and 88 , where the Dieis under the heading πόλεις are listed as members of the Second Athenian Naval League; and membership of the Delian League and the Second Athenian Naval League strongly indicates polis status until, at least, 371 ( infra ). The external use of the cityethnic/demotic is attested collectively in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 31 ) and individually in Heltic inscriptions ( IG xii . 9 1187 . 3 (C3m); SEG 34 909 . 52 (C2 -C1 )). According to Strabo 10 . 1 . 5 , Dion was situated at Cape Kenaion near Oreos. However, the urban centre has not yet been precisely located. Following Ulrichs (( 1863 ) 237 , see supra 647 ), Geyer ( 1903 ) 99 suggested a location at modern Lichas. Sapouna-Sakellaraki ( 1994 -95 ), followed by Barr ., prefers the hill of Kastri on the western shore of the Kenaion peninsula. But Homer describes Dion as an αιπυgrave πτολίεθρον (Hom. Il . 2 . 538 ; cf. Nonnus, Dion . 13 . 161 : κραναοgraveν πέδον ), and in the Athenian tribute lists the Dians are often specified as ∆ι ˜ ες αποgrave Κεναίο ( IG i³ 279 . i . 86 ). The presumption is that Dion was situated somewhere on Mt. Kenaion. Lichas would fit, but autopsy (Reber) revealed nothing but remains of the Byzantine period.An alternative location is Khironisi, whose position fits the information given by Ptol. Geog . 3 . 15 . 25 (cf. Reber ( 2001 ) 456 -60 ). Dion was a member of the Delian League, and may have been among the original members ( ATL iii. 198 -99 ). It belonged to the Island district ( IG i³ 269 . v . 25 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 451 / 50 ( IG i³ 262 . i . 28 ) to 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . i . 80 ), a total of twelve times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. in 451 / 50 , but in all subsequent years 2 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 264 . iv . 31 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 78 ). From the Athenian regulations for Histiaia/Oreos (no. 372 ) of C5s it appears that Dion was a deme of Histiaia/Oreos, but was a separate circuit of jurisdiction ( IG i³ 41 . 100 -2 = SEG 32 3 ; Koch ( 1991 ) 175 , 202 ). Similarly, Dion (and Athenai Diades (no. 364 )) are attested as dependencies of Histiaia/Oreos in the last decade of C5 ( IG xii . 9 188 . 18 -19 = Staatsverträge 205 , post-411 ; Knoepfler ( 2001 ) nn. 338 -39 , post-404 ). Thus, in C5s, Dion seems to have had a double status partly as a polis depending on Histiaia/Oreos and partly as a demos of Histiaia/Oreos. Dion must have recovered its independence in C4e, since it is recorded among the original members of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 . 88 ), whereas the Histiaians are recorded somewhat later (B 18 ). Dion may have left the League together with Thebes (no. 221 ) in 371 or shortly afterwards (Dreher ( 1995 ) 173 ). The presumption is that Dion was a polis in the political sense down to C4f. In Ps.-Skylax 58 , however, Euboia is described as a tetrapolis ; cf. Dem. 23 . 213 and the treaty with Athens of 357 ( IG ii² 124 . 15 -16 ), which testifies to a total of four poleis on Euboia in 357 . The inference is that by C4m Dion had been incorporated into Histiaia/Oreos (no. 372 ) (Moggi, Sin . 290 -92 ). In C3m Dion is attested as a deme of Histiaia/Oreos ( IG xii . 9 1187 . 3 )."
369,Dystos,Euboia,38.2,24.1,711,3744,"369 . Dystos Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 20 , long. 24 . 10 . Size of territory: 1 ? Type: A. The toponym is ∆υacuteστος , οasper (Theopomp. fr. 149 ; IG xii . 9 88 . 3 , Rom.).Steph.Byz. 246 . 5 suggests an ethnic ∆υacuteστιος , but inscriptions invariably record the ablative form of the toponym: ∆υστό ( θεν ) ( IG xii . 9 191 . 9 ; cf. Knoepfler ( 2001 ) 357 ), mostly in an even more abbreviated form: either ∆υστ or ∆υς or ∆υ (ibid.). Dystos is called a polis in the urban sense by Theopomp. fr. 149 : Θεόπο µ πος εν Φιλιππικῶν κδ ' αποστήσας δεgrave τουgraveς εν αυτηsubiotaηtilde τηsubiotaηtilde περιοκίδι τῶν ' Ερετριέων εστράτευσεν επιgrave πόλιν ∆υacuteστον ' . Since the fragment comes from the fourteenth book of the Philippika , the year must be 349 / 8 . Following Knoepfler ( 1981 ) 301 , we believe that the subject of the verb is probably Kleitarchos, the exiled political leader who with a contingent of Phokian mercenaries and supported by Eretrian citizens attacked the tyrant Ploutarchos, controlled the Eretrian perioikis , and attacked the polis of Dystos. Theopompos' use of the term polis is open to three different interpretations: ( 1 ) Polis is used in the sense of town without any implications about the political status of the community (thus Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 332 ). ( 2 ) Theopompos was misinformed and believed, erroneously, that Dystos was a polis (a possibility suggested by Hansen and Nielsen ( 2000 ) 145 ). ( 3 ) Like Grynchai (no. 371 ) and Styra (no. 377 ), Dystos had once been a polis , but was transformed into an Eretrian deme in, probably, C5f, and now combined the status of being an Eretrian civic subdivision with being a kind of dependent polis (thus Hansen and Nielsen ( 2000 ) 145 -46 ; cf. Hansen ( 2000 ) 209 -10 ). This view is supported by the fact that Dystos was the dominant, perhaps even the only deme of the sixth Eretrian phyle (cf. Knoepfler (1997) 403). The size of the territory is unknown. At the southern end of the valley of Dystos is a rock inscription ΟΡΟΣ ∆ΗΜΟΥ (Apostolidis and Apostolidis ( 1990 -91 ), and a boundary stone with the same inscription was found at the foot of the hill near the chapel of Ag. Giorgios ( IG xii . 9 78 (C5 -C4 ); Apostolidis and Apostolidis ( 1990 -91 )). Dystos is attested as a settlement in the prehistoric period (Sackett et al . ( 1966 ) 76 no. 84 ) and was refounded in the Archaic period (Hoepfner ( 1999 ) 352 ). Dystos may have been a Dryopian settlement (Geyer ( 1903 ) 111 ). In C4 it was an Eretrian deme belonging to the second district (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 381 ). The characteristic hill in the valley of Dystos accommodated both the acropolis and the settlement. Long stretches are preserved of a C4 defence circuit with interval towers and a gate in the eastern part. The circuit encloses an area of c. 5 ha. From the gate a road leads to a large terrace in the northern part of the town where, probably, the agora was situated. Many of the houses are well preserved and in some cases a second storey can be traced. House K dates from C6 , and the more elaborate house J probably from C4 . The acropolis on the top of the hill was fortified with a separate defence circuit. Some foundations of buildings not yet excavated may be remains of sanctuaries. An undated subterranean gallery was discovered in 1998 ( BCH 123 ( 1999 ) 794 ). The cemeteries lay at the foot of the hill (Hoepfner ( 1999 )). West of the hill was a lake, now drained. This lake has traditionally been identified as the lake drained by Chairephanes ( IG xii . 9 191 ( 322 -308 )), but Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 380 -81 has pointed out that this lake was situated near Ptechai, which belonged to a different district from that of Dystos; cf. Knoepfler ( 2001 ) 191 -94 ."
370,Eretria (Eretrieus),Euboia,38.25,23.5,4905,23790,"370 . Eretria (Eretrieus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 25 , long. 23 . 50 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A. The toponym is ' Ερέτρια , ηasper ( IG xii . 9 196 . 10 , 12 (C4s); Hdt. 1 . 61 . 2 ; Lys. 20 . 14 ). The toponym usually denotes the urban centre (Ps.-Skylax 58 ) but sometimes the city plus hinterland = the territory of Eretria ( IG xii . 9197 . 12 -14 (C4 ); cf. Knoepfler ( 2001 ) 53 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ερετριευacuteς ( IvO 248 (C5e); ML 27 . 8 ( 479 ); IG xii . 9 188 . 17 ( c. 400 ); Xen. An . 7 . 8 . 8 ; Arist. Pol . 1289 b 39 ). Variant forms of the city-ethnic are ' Ερέτριος or ' Ερετριαῖος or ' Ερετριάτης . But they are found only in late lexicographers and have no authority (Steph. Byz. 276 . 8 -9 ; Etym. Magn . 371 . 7 ; Phot. Lex .). Eretria is called a polis both in the urban sense ( IG xii . 9 196 . 10 -11 ; Thuc. 8 . 95 . 3 , 6 ; Dem. 9 . 57 ; Ps.-Skylax 58 ) and in the political sense ( IG xii . 9 187 . 9 ( c. 410 ); IG ii² 16 .B. 2 ( 394 / 3 ); Knoepfler ( 2001 ) 1 . 6 -7 (C4s), 3 . 7 ( 330 -320 ); Hdt. 6 . 106 . 2 ; Aeschin. 3 . 94 ). In an inscription of C6s, polis denotes the urban centre rather than the acropolis ( SEG 41 725 B = Nomima i 91 ; cf. Flensted-Jensen et al . ( 2000 ) 165 ). The community is described as patris in one of Plato's epigrams ( AG 7 256 = Diehl fr. 10 , but perhaps spurious) and the town as an asty (Thuc. 8 . 95 . 4 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in Eretrian citizenship and proxeny decrees (Knoepfler ( 2001 ) 1 . 10 -11 ; IG xii . 9 187 B. 12 (C4f), 195 . 5 (C4s)) and externally in a C5e dedication in Olympia ( IvO 248 ) and on the Serpent Column (ML 27 . 8 ). The individual and external use is attested in a casualty list of 424 / 3 (?) from Tanagra ( IG vii 585 . i . 16 -17 ), in a Delphic list of tamiai of 337 / 6 ( CID ii 74 . 47 ), and in a C4m list of proxenoi of Karthaia (no. 492 ) ( IG xii . 5 542 a 8 ). The territory of Eretria is called ηasper ' Ερετρία (Thuc. 8 . 60 . 1 , 8 . 95 . 6 ) or ηasper ' Ερετρικηgrave χώρη (Hdt. 6 . 101 . 1 ; cf. Pl. Leg . 698 D). In C4m it covered c. 1500 km ² and was subdivided into five districts (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 371 -73 , map on 402 ), called χῶροι ( IG xii . 9 189 . 24 -25 ; Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 376 ). T o date, only one district is known by name: viz . Μεσόχωρος ( IG xii . 9 241 . 37 ; Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 375 -77 ). Each district was further subdivided into a number of territorial demes ( IG xii . 9 241 ; Wallace ( 1947 ) 119 -24 ; Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 371 ), actually called δηtilde µ οι ( SEG 41 723 ; Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 374 ) and each headed by a demarch ( ∆ή µ αρχος , IG xii . 9 189 . 23 -24 ). There were altogether some fifty-five to sixty demes (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 358 ), of which more than fifty are attested in the preserved inscriptions (Jones, POAG 75 -76 with corrigenda in Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 355 -58 ). Some of the demes were former poleis which had been incorporated into Eretria and reduced to the status of demoi . Such were Styra (no. 377 ), possibly, Grynchai (no. 371 ) and Dystos (no. 369 ) and, perhaps, Peraia (no. 375 ). The Eretrian citizen body was subdivided into, probably, six tribes (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 390 -92 ), called phylai ( SEG 45 1141 ). Two of them are known by name: viz . Μηκισστίς ( IG xii suppl . 548 . 4 -5 = Nomima i 39 (C5e)) and Ναρκίττις ( REG 108 ( 1995 ) p. xxxix). A third was probably called Μελανηίς (Strabo 10 . 1 . 10 ; Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 393 ). They were named after local heroes and were thus different from the six old Ionian phylai (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 392 -93 ). Each phyle was composed of a number of demes drawn from all five choroi . Thus, one phyle comprised all citizens from twelve demes plus some citizens from the demes of Grynchai, Pereia and Styra whose members were divided between all six Eretrian phylai ( IG xii . 9245 and Suppl . 555 ; Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 393 -400 ). Whereas the organisation into phylai must go back to c. 500 or earlier, the subdivision into five districts must have been introduced some time in C4f (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 392 ). According to Strabo 10 . 1 . 10 , Eretrias' military strength was recorded on an ancient stele set up in the sanctuary of Artemis Amarysia.The figures he reports are 3 , 000 hoplites, 600 hippeis and 60 chariots. For the andrapodismos of 490 , see infra . In C4l Eretria had some 6 , 000 adult male citizens, as can be inferred retrospectively from a cluster of lists of names of c. 280 (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 395 ). (a) From a fragmentary list of ephebes organised into the five districts ( IG xii . 9 241 = Wallace ( 1947 ) 120 (C4l-C3e)) it can be inferred that a year class of ephebes numbered some 150 -200 young Eretrians,both hoplites and psiloi (cf. Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 404 ). (b) Some large lists of names with patronymics and demotics are probably a roster of Eretrians organised into their phylai (I: IG xii . 9 245 ; II: IG xii . 9 246 ; iii : IG xii . 9 247 + 252 + unpublished fragment (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 397 ); IV: unpublished fragment (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) n. 318 ); V-VI: no lists preserved)); see Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 395 -400 . IG xii . 9 245 is almost complete and has 869 names preserved,plus about sixty names now lost = a total of 930 names.On the assumption that there were six phylai of equal size, c. 5 , 500 Eretrians were recorded on the lists. A year class of 150 -200 ephebes corresponds to a force of some 4 , 200 -5 , 000 citizens of military age ( 18 -59 ) and fit for military service, and to a total adult male citizen population of c. 5 , 750 -6 , 850 minimum, including those over 60 and those unfit for military service (Hansen ( 1985 ) 12 ). Since the army seems to have been organised in accordance with the five districts,the presumption is that the lists organised into phylai were a roster of all adult male Eretrian citizens. Next to nothing is known about the history of Eretria before c. 500 . Apart from colonisation ( infra ), the only event reported in the sources is the semi-mythical Lelantine War, fought in C8s or in C7f (Plut. Mor . 868 E; Parker ( 1997 )) between Eretria and Chalkis (no. 365 ) and their allies over the possession of the Lelantine Plain (Thuc. 1 . 15 . 3 ; Hdt. 5 . 99 . 1 ; Strabo 10 . 1 . 12 ; Hes. Op . 654 and Plut. Mor . 153 F, 760 E-761 A; cf. Staatsverträge 102 ). In 499 Eretria supported the Ionian revolt with five triremes (Hdt. 5 . 99 . 1 ). Their crews assisted in the capture of Sardes, and their strategos was killed in the ensuing battle of Ephesos (Hdt. 5 . 102 . 3 ; cf. also Lysanias ( FGrHist 426 ) fr. 1 ). Therefore, Eretria was the first main target of the Persian punitive expedition against Hellas in 490 (Hdt. 6 . 98 . 1 ). Having pillaged the countryside, the Persians laid siege to Eretria, and on the seventh day the city was betrayed by two leading citizens and conquered (Hdt. 6 . 100 -1 ); the sanctuaries were burnt down, and the population exposed to andrapodismos : men, women and children were sent to Sousa and were settled in the neighbourhood where their descendants still lived in C5m (Hdt. 6 . 106 . 2 , 107 . 2 , 115 , 118 -19 ; Pl. Menex . 240 A; Philostr. VA 1 . 24 , probably based on Ktesias (letter from Knoepfler)). In spite of the andrapodismos the Eretrians were capable of fighting with seven triremes at Artemision (Hdt. 8 . 1 . 2 ) and at Salamis (Hdt. 8 . 46 . 2 ). Together with Styra (no. 377 ) they provided 600 hoplites at Plataiai (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 5 ) and are duly recorded on the Serpent Column (ML 27 . 8 ). Eretria was a member of the Delian League,and may have been among the original members ( ATL iii. 198 -99 ). It belonged to the Island district ( IG i³ 269 . v . 30 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 448 / 7 ( IG i³ 264 . iv . 11 ) to 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 51 ), a total of nine times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of, perhaps, 6 tal. ( IG i³ 264 . ic . 11 ) but later 3 tal. ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 51 ), perhaps from 441 / 40 ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 97 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 67 : 15 tal.), and in 413 Eretria was still listed among the paying members (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 4 ). In 446 Eretria joined Chalkis in defecting from Athens; but the revolt was quenched by an Athenian army under Perikles (Thuc. 1 . 114 . 1 -3 ). The conditions imposed on Eretria seem to have been similar to those of Chalkis ( IG i³ 39 ; 40 . 40 -43 ; supra 648 ), and no klerouchy is attested (Gehrke, Stasis 64 n. 9 ). On the other hand, a decree of 442 / 1 ordered that the sons of the richest Eretrians be sent to Athens as hostages (Hesych. Ε 5746 ; Phot. Ε 1908 ). The assessment in 425 / 4 resulted in yet another Euboian revolt, which Eretria probably joined (Philoch. fr. 130 ; Paus. 1 . 29 . 2 ; cf. Knoepfler ( 1996 )). After initial contacts with Sparta (no. 345 ) in 413 (Thuc. 8 . 5 . 1 ), Eretria defected from Athens once again in 411 in connection with the Athenian defeat in the naval battle fought outside the harbour of the city (Thuc. 8 . 95 . 3 -6 ). In c. 400 Eretria concluded an alliance with Histiaia/Oreos (no. 372 ) ( IG xii . 9 188 = Staatsverträge 205 ; cf. Knoepfler ( 2001 ) 82 ), and in 394 one with Athens (no. 361 ) ( IG ii² 16 = Staatsverträge 229 ). In C4e a sympoliteia agreement was concluded with Keos ( SEG 14 530 = Staatsverträge 232 ; but see Cargill ( 1981 ) 136 n. 14 ). The Eretrians were among the original members of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 . 81 ). But they probably left the League together with Thebes (no. 221 ) in 371 or shortly afterwards (Dreher ( 1995 ) 173 ; Knoepfler ( 1995 ) 331 -33 ). In any case, Eretria cannot have been a member of the League when in 366 Themison, the tyrant of Eretria, dispossessed Athens of Oropos (no. 214 ) (Diod. 15 . 76 . 1 ). Like the other Euboian poleis , however, Eretria was torn by stasis between a proTheban and a pro-Athenian faction (Gehrke, Stasis 65 ). In 357 both Athenian and Theban forces invaded the island and clashed in several battles and skirmishes. The Athenians won, and the Euboian poleis rejoined the League (Diod. 16 . 7 . 2 ; Aeschin. 3 . 85 ; Dem. 8 . 74 ; IG ii² 124 . 16 = Tod 153 , improved readings in Knoepfler ( 1995 ) 335 -37 ; Brunt ( 1969 ) 247 -48 ). In 349 / 8 an Athenian army under Phokion came to the rescue of Ploutarchos, the tyrant of Eretria, who, however, betrayed the Athenians (Plut. Phoc . 12 -13 ; Gehrke ( 1976 ) 7 -11 ). After the Athenian victory at Tamynai, Eretria joined the League again, as attested in the Athenian decree of, probably, 343 ( IG ii² 125 ; cf. SEG 34 67 , 45 1210 ). The Eretrians provided synedroi for the synedrion and contributed a syntaxis of 5 tal. (Aeschin. 3 . 94 , 100 ). In the same period Philip of Makedon seems to have infiltrated Euboia (Dem. 9 . 57 , 10 . 8 ; Brunt ( 1969 ) 251 -52 ), and in 342 he had the leaders of his faction in Eretria installed as tyrants ( infra ). After their expulsion in 341 a new alliance between Athens and Eretria was concluded ( IG ii² 230 ; see Knoepfler ( 1985 )). In 340 some kind of short-lived league with a common council was established under the leadership of Kallias of Chalkis (Aeschin. 3 . 89 , 94 ; Staatsverträge 342 ); it included Eretria, Chalkis (no. 365 ) and Histiaia/Oreos (no. 372 ). Because of the contemporary issue of a common Euboian coinage ( supra 643 ) the union has sometimes been interpreted as a federation ( Staatsverträge 342 ; Picard ( 1979 )), but see Beck ( 1997 ) 28 . The Eretrian constitution was one of the 158 politeiai described by Aristotle and his pupils (Heracl. Lemb. 40 = Arist. no. 45 , Gigon; cf. Plut. Mor . 293 A, 298 B). In the Archaic period Eretria was an oligarchy governed by the class of hippeis who formed the core of the Eretrian army (Arist. Pol . 1289 b 33 -39 , 1306 a 33 -39 ; Ath . Pol . 15 . 2 ). This constitution was overturned in C6s and perhaps before 510 ( IG xii . 9 p. 147 . 111 -24 ) at the instigation of a certain Diagoras (Arist. Pol . 1306 a 35 -36 ; Heracl. Lemb. 40 ), and it was replaced by 'a democracy' (Gehrke, Stasis 63 ; cf. IG xii Suppl . 549 A: [ έδοξε τηtildeι βουληtilde ] ι καιgrave τῶι [ δή µ ωι ] (C5e); cf. Knoepfler ( 2001 ) 74 n. 293 ). The common view that, in 446 , a democratic constitution was either maintained or, alternatively, imposed by the Athenians (Balcer ( 1978 ) 56 ; Gehrke, Stasis 64 ) is based on an analogy with a not altogether convincing interpretation of the Athenian regulations for Chalkis ( ATL iii. 150 no. 15 ). An honorary decree of c. 411 , passed by the boule alone and not by (the boule and) the demos , indicates that the defection from Athens in 411 was followed by the introduction of an oligarchic constitution ( IG xii . 9 187 A). But a somewhat later honorary decree inscribed on the same stele is passed by the boule and the demos , suggesting a democracy in C4e ( IG xii . 9 187 B). Later in C4Eretria was ruled by a number of tyrants (Berve ( 1967 ) 301 -2 ): Themison from before 366 to 357 (Aeschin. 3 . 85 ; Dem. 18 . 99 ; Diod 15 . 76 . 1 ), Menestratos in 352 (Dem. 23 . 124 ), Plutarchos from before 350 to 348 (Dem. 5 . 5 , 9 . 57 , 21 . 110 , 200 ; Aeschin. 3 . 86 ; Plut. Phoc . 12 -13 ). Plutarchos was deposed by the Eretrian demos led by Kleitarchos (schol. Dem. 5 . 5 ), but after a short period of democratic government (Dem. 9 . 57 ), Kleitarchos was himself in 342 installed by Philip of Makedon as tyrannos of Eretria together with Hipparchos and Automedon (Dem. 9 . 58 ; cf. 18 . 71 , 79 -81 , 295 ; Aeschin. 3 . 103 ; Harp. Ι 15 ; Gehrke ( 1976 )). In the following year, however, Eretria was besieged and conquered by an Athenian force (Philoch. fr. 160 ), and the tyrants were expelled again (schol. Aeschin. 3 . 85 ; Diod. 16 . 74 . 1 ). A democracy was set up (Philoch. fr. 160 ), an anti-tyranny law passed by the Eretrian people ( IG xii . 9 190 ( c. 340 )), and a sacred law belongs in the same context ( IG xii . 9 189 = LSCG 92 ). Decrees passed under the new democratic regime are introduced with the formula έδοξεν τ ˜ ει βουλεῖ καιgrave τ ˜ οι δή µ οι ( IG xii . 9 189 . 4 ( c. 340 )), or έδοξεν τ ˜ οι δή µ οι (Knoepfler ( 2001 ) 2 ( 330 -320 )) or, once, έδοξε τ ˜ ει εκκλησίει (Knoepfler ( 2001 ) 1 . 2 -3 ), and bills are often moved by a board of probouloi ( IG xii . 9 191 . 35 ). The eponymous officials were a board of three archontes ( LSAG 84 no. 9 ; SEG 34 898 (C6l); IG xii . 9 191 .A. 8 (C4l); cf. Sherk ( 1990 ) 238 ). The principal military officials were a board of strategoi ( IG xii . 9 191 . 44 ; Hdt. 5 . 102 . 3 ) and a board of five taxiarchoi ( IG ii² 230 b. 12 -17 ), each presumably commanding a regiment provided by one of the five districts (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 372 ). Alongside the five(?) taxeis there was a cavalry of, probably, 500 hippeis = 100 per district ( IG ii² 230 a. 3 -4 as restored by Knoepfler ( 1985 ) = SEG 35 59 ). Together with the other Euboian poleis Eretria was a member of the Amphiktyonic League (Lefèvre ( 1998 ) 59 -63 ), and provided in some years one of the two Ionian hieromnemones (Aeschin. 2 . 116 ; CID ii 102 . i . 9 ), in other years a tamias ( CID ii 74 . 47 ). Athenian envoys were sent to Eretria in 357 / 6 ( IG ii² 124 . 16 ) and in 340 (Aeschin. 3 . 100 ). Eretrian envoys were sent to Athens ( IG ii² 230 b). Eretria granted citizenship to a man of Sikyon (no. 228 ) (Knoepfler ( 2001 ) 1 (C4s)) and proxenia to citizens of Opous (no. 386 ) (Knoepfler ( 2001 ) 4 (C4l)) and Taras (no. 71 ) ( IG xii . 9 187 A and B (C5 -C4 ) = Knoepfler ( 2001 ) ii-iii); see also Knoepfler ( 2001 ) 2 ( 330 -320 ). Eretrian citizens received proxenia from Delphi (no. 177 ) ( SEG 16 319 (C4 -C3 )) and Karthaia (no. 492 ) ( IG xii . 5 542 . 8 (C4m)). In C4s Eretria had a theorodokos to host theoroi from Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .B. 41 -43 ( 331 / 0 -313 )). Only one Eretrian citizen is attested as victor in the Olympic Games ( Olympionikai 177 ( c. 492 )), and none in any of the other major Panhellenic games. The Pantheon of Eretria in the Classical period is almost exclusively known from inscriptions and archaeological evidence (Schachter ( 1992 ) 18 -21 ; Novaro ( 1996 )). The tutelary god of Eretria was Apollo Daphnephoros ( IG xii . 9 191 . 10 , 49 ; Knoepfler ( 2001 ) 17 ), in whose sanctuary public enactments were published ( IG xii . 9 210 . 26 -29 ). Divinities worshipped in the town itself were Aphrodite? (Themelis ( 1982 ) 179 ), Asklepios ( IG xii . 9 194 (C4 -C3 ); LSCG 93 ), Dionysos ( IG xii . 9 192 , 207 . 45 with SEG 34 896 (C3e?)), Hera ( IG xii . 9 189 . 27 ), Poseidon (Knoepfler ( 2000 )) and Demeter, for whom thesmophoria are attested (Plut. Mor . 298 B, probably derived from the Aristotelian Politeia ; cf. Metzger ( 1985 ); Willers ( 1991 )). The two major extra-urban cults were those of Artemis Amarysia at Amarynthos with musical contests ( IG xii . 9 189 = LSGC92 ; IG xii . 9 191 . 57 , 59 , 195 . 10 -12 ; Knoepfler ( 1988 ) 383 -91 ) and Apollo at Tamynai (Harp. Τ 3 ; Strabo 10 . 1 . 10 ; IG xii . 9 90 -92 ). The Eretrian calendar is typically Euboian. The month Antestherion is attested in C4s ( IG xii . 9 189 = LSCG 92 ), and the months Apatourion,Lenaion and Heraion in the C3law concerning the Dionysian artists ( IG xii . 9 207 ; see Trümpy, Monat . 39 -41 ). The city of Eretria is bordered to the south by the sea, to the west by a stream, to the north by a hill which naturally became the acropolis; to the east was an area of marshy ground. The ancient port lay partly in the same vicinity as the modern port. The urban area of modern Eretria in the 1960 s gives some idea of its extent in C4 . At that time, it was surrounded by a high city wall which, starting from the sea in the west, followed the western side of the acropolis, then ran along its steepest slope on the north, then turned south to the sea to complete the circuit. The port itself was fortified by a curtain-wall and towers. At intervals along the city wall were posterns, a monumental gate to the west (Krause ( 1972 )) and an eastern gate that has not been found. We know that the city was protected by a wall in 490 , since the Persians had to lay siege for six days, and Eretria fell only because of treachery (Hdt. 6 . 101 . 2 ), whereafter the walls were demolished (Strabo 10 . 1 . 10 ). In our current state of knowledge it is impossible to date the first fortifications with any certainty. The existing wall, with its gates, posterns and towers, dates from C4 . It was about 4 , 260 m in length; the total area enclosed by the wall was about 81 . 5 ha. The top of the acropolis was 123 m from the sea. Eretria was besieged in 341 (Philoch. fr. 160 ). The first traces of occupation on the acropolis date to the second millennium ( AntK ( 1994 ) 94 -96 , ( 1995 ) 108 -19 , ( 1996 ) 107 -11 ). Middle Helladic remains have been found in the plain, not far from the future agora. During the Protogeometric period (C9 ), only the tombs attest to some sort of human presence ( AntK ( 2000 ) 134 -45 ). The first evidence of settlement, dating from C8 , comes from three areas: near the port, on the site of the later sanctuary of Apollo, and at several places at the foot of the acropolis. The buildings were oval or apsidal in plan, with the entrance on the short side ( AntK ( 1981 ) 85 -86 , ( 2000 ) 128 -30 , ( 2001 ) 84 -87 ). A group of tombs also dates from C8 ; their location was marked on the ground by a triangular stone structure, and they contained exceptionally rich grave-goods (bronze cauldrons, gold jewellery, iron weapons, a bronze spearhead). They have been interpreted as a heroon. The remains of later buildings nearby have been attributed to a heroic cult (Bérard ( 1970 )). The oldest buildings in the area of the sanctuary of Apollo Daphnephoros, apsidal in plan, were followed at the end of C8 by a longer edifice (a hekatompedon ), also with an apse. Because of the altar at its east end and the finds of offerings and pottery, this has been identified as the first temple of Apollo, the city's chief divinity. A second temple, rectangular in plan, perhaps Ionic,preceded the large Doric hexastyle temple of C6l which was burned down by the Persians in 490 (Hdt. 6 . 101 . 3 ; Auberson ( 1968 )). Tothe north of the temple of Apollo,a sacrificial area with a deposit of sacred objects has yielded numerous offerings, the earliest dating from C8 ; some came from the Middle East, others from Egypt and from the West. The cult celebrated there was perhaps dedicated to a female divinity (Huber ( 2003 )). The foundations of another sanctuary were discovered cut in the rock at the top of the acropolis; they were accompanied by offerings similar to those found in the sacred deposit in the sacrificial area. The divinity honoured is uncertain, but the offerings suggest that it may have been female ( AntK ( 1994 ) 97 -99 ). Among the other religious buildings for which there is archaeological evidence, the temple of Dionysos, located next to the theatre (Auberson ( 1976 )), may date from C4e, while the siting of a thesmophorion on the south slope of the acropolis is controversial (Metzger ( 1985 ); Muller ( 1996 ) 165 -68 ; Willers ( 1991 )). Several clues suggest that a sanctuary of Asklepios was situated in the neighbourhood of the House of the Mosaics. The large sanctuary of Artemis Amarynthia lies outside the city but in the chora , about 10 km to the south. Its approximate location is known, but the temple proper has not yet been found (Knoepfler ( 1988 )). No public or official buildings have yet come to light. However, we do know the location of the agora from the Archaic and Classical periods, which was near the sanctuary of Apollo Daphnephoros.The porticos along four sides have been located or partially cleared. The function of an elegant circular building ( tholos ) on the east side of the agora remains unknown.To the north of the agora a large fountain provided a public water-supply; long sections of the conduits have been uncovered. Other conduits for supplying fresh water and carrying away waste have been found under several streets. The main street linked the west gate to the east gate, passing to the south of the theatre and along the southern flank of the acropolis. Halfway between the two gates, another street branched off towards the agora,skirting the sanctuary of Apollo on the way. Other streets have been found in various parts of the city, the longest in the western quarter (Reber ( 1998 )). Eretria had a huge theatre ( TGR ii. 215 -16 ), and some of the earliest phases may date to C4 ; cf. IG xii . 9 193 . 6 (C4l), a gymnasium, a palaestra and baths. Although the visible remains of these buildings are no older than the Heltic period, it is reasonable to suppose that they were already functioning in C4 or even earlier. The Classical and Heltic areas of the city are well known thanks to the systematic exploration of the vast houses, some of which are particularly luxurious (Reber ( 1998 ); Ducrey et al . ( 1993 )). Eretria struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard, c. 525 -446 and c. 411 -400 . Denominations: tetradrachm, didrachm, drachm, diobol, obol, hemiobol. The most common types are obv . cow scratching itself, sometimes with a bird on its back; rev . octopus in incuse square. The legend ΕΡΕΤΡΙΕΩΝ is found only on C2 bronze coins (Head, HN ² 360 -64 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) 91 -92 ; SNG Cop. Aetolia-Euboea 468 -96 ). It is not known whether the C4 and C3 'federal' issues were struck by Eretria (Wallace ( 1956 )) or by Chalkis (no. 365 ) (Picard ( 1979 )); see also Brunner ( 1998 ) and supra 649 . Eretria was involved in the colonisation of Dikaia (no. 568 ), Mende (no. 584 ), Methone ( 541 ), Okolon ( 626 ), Pharbelos (no. 591 ), Pithekoussai (no. 65 ) and Skabala (no. 607 )."

Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 359 ); variant forms are /asper Ρυacuteγκαι (Steph. Byz. 547 . 17 ) and Τρυacuteχαι (Steph. Byz. 639 . 15 ). The city-ethnic is Γρυνχευacuteς ( IG i³ 270 . v . 22 ) or Γρυγχευacuteς ( IG i³ 71 . i . 81 ) or Βρυνχειευacuteς ( IG i³ 264 . iv . 12 ) or Βρυγχειευacuteς ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 69 ). Grynchai is not called a polis in any source, but the attestation of the community in the Athenian tribute lists is an indication of polis status, as is the peculiar incorporation of the Gryncheis into all six Eretrian phylai ( infra ). Grynchai has been located near modern Krieza, where tombs and architectural fragments have been found (Gehrke ( 1988 ) 33 -34 ; Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 384 with n. 250 ). Grynchai was a member of the Delian League, and may have been among the original members ( ATL iii. 198 -99 ). It belonged to the Island district ( IG i³ 270 . v . 22 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 451 / 50 ( IG i³ 262 . i . 24 ) to 416 / 5 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 23 ), a total of thirteen times, three times completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 262 . i . 24 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 81 : 2 , 000 dr.). In C5l (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 354 ), Grynchai became a deme of Eretria (no. 370 ), belonging to the third district (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 384 , 402 ). The Gryncheis were divided among all six Eretrian phylai ( IG xii . 9 245 A. 158 , 246 A. 181 ff, 247 . i . 9 ; Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 393 -400 )."

Pol . 1303 b 33 ; IG i³ 41 . 89 ); later it is ' Ωρεός (Aeschin. 3 . 103 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 33 . 1 ; Dem. 18 . 79 ; IG ii² 682 . 14 (C3e)), either ηasper (Thuc. 8 . 95 . 7 ; Paus. 7 . 26 . 4 ) or οasper (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 56 ; Strabo 10 . 1 . 3 , 5 ). The corresponding city-ethnics are ' Ιστιαιευacuteς (Hdt. 8 . 23 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 3 ; CID ii 75 . ii . 47 ( 336 / 5 ); IG ii² 8939 (C4 )), ' Εστιαιευacuteς (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 2 ) and ' Ωρείτης (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 56 ; SEG 27 17 . 5 (C4m); IG iv 617 . 3 (C4l); CID ii 93 . 51 ( 329 / 8 )). The change of name (Robert ( 1951 ) 179 n. 2 ) is explicitly mentioned in several sources (Paus. 7 . 26 . 4 ; schol. Thuc. 1 . 114 ), and at Strabo 10 . 1 . 3 it is connected with the establishment of an Athenian klerouchy in 446 . But the sources testify to a considerable overlap between the two names (cf. Strabo 10 . 1 . 4 ). Both toponyms are attested in Thucydides, Hestiaia at 7 . 57 . 2 and Oreos at 8 . 95 . 7 . The earliest attestation of the toponym Oreos is in Ar. Pax 1047 , 1057 , whereas the toponym Histiaia (in a contemporary context) is attested as late as C4f ( IG xii . 5 594 . 12 = Staatsverträge 287 ), and the city-ethnic Histiaieus in inscriptions of C3 ( CID ii 126 . 2 (C3f); IG xii . 9 1186 . 12 (C3s)) and on coins of C2 (Head, HN ² 364 -65 ). Histiaia/Oreos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 8 . 23 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 58 ; Dem. 9 . 61 , 62 ) and in the political sense (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 57 ; Dem. 9 . 59 -60 ; Aeschin. 3 . 94 ; Arist. Pol . 1303 b 32 -3 ; IG xii . 5 594 . 3 (C4f); IG xii . 9 188 . 6 -7 (C4f)). Πολίτης is found in Semon. 9 . 62 . The collective sense of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C4 coins ( infra ) and externally in inscriptions ( IG xii . 5 594 . 15 (C4f)) and in literature (Hdt. 8 . 23 . 2 ; Thuc. 7 . 57 . 2 ; Dem. 23 . 213 ). The individual and external use is attested in inscriptions (IG xii . 9 7 . 9 (C4m); CID ii 93 . 51 ( 329 / 8 )) and in literature (Hdt. 8 . 23 . 1 ; Aeschin. 3 . 223 ). The territory is called ηasper γηtilde ηasper ' Ιστιαιώτις (Hdt. 7 . 175 . 2 , 8 . 23 . 2 ). From C4m it comprised all of northern Euboia, some 850 km ² , and bordered on the territory of Chalkis (no. 365 ). At 23 . 213 Demosthenes claims that the Oreitans inhabited a quarter of the island ( µ έρος τέταρτον ). The exact frontier is unknown, but it seems to have crossed the island north of Kerinthos but south of Elymnion (Gehrke ( 1994 ) 336 -41 ). Down to C4f Dion (no. 368 ) and Athenai Diades (no. 364 ), both on the Kenaion peninsula, were self-governing poleis , and so were, probably, Orobiai (no. 374 ) on the west coast of Euboia and Poseidion (no. 376 ) on the east coast ( infra 660 ). In the Heltic period all four are attested as demes of Oreos:Athenai Diades ( IG xii . 9 1186 . 2 ), Dion ( IG xii . 9 1187 . 3 ), Orobiai ( IG xii . 9 1186 . 3 ) and Poseidion ( IG xii . 9 1189 . 20 , 28 , 39 ). Some thirty demes are recorded in Heltic inscriptions ( IG xii . 9 1186 -89 ; Jones, POAG 77 -78 ). We hear about Histiaian demes already in C5s ( IG i³ 41 . 100 ), and in C4m the citizens of Histiaia/Oreos were organised into tribes and demes ( IG xii . 5 594 . 10 = Staatsverträge 287 ). The board of six archontes ( infra ) indicates that there were six phylai as in Eretria (no. 370 ) (Knoepfler by letter). Oreos (Theopomp. fr. 387 ) and Dion ( IG i³ 41 . 101 ) are the only named Heltic demes which can be traced back to the Classical period ( supra ). In 480 , however,the core territory of Histiaia/Oreos comprised a number of komai along the coast (Hdt. 8 . 23 . 2 ), of which two may have been Khironisi and Oreos (Sackett et al . ( 1966 ) 111 ; for Khironisi/Dion, see also Reber ( 2001 ) 456 -60 ). After the battle of Artemision in 480 Histiaia/Oreos was conquered by the Persians, and its territory was ravaged (Hdt. 8 . 23 . 2 ). Histiaia/Oreos was a member of the Delian League, and may have been among the original members ( ATL iii. 198 -99 ). It is recorded in the tribute lists in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 34 ), 448 / 7 ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 6 ) and 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 36 ), paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 36 ). In 446 Hestiaia joined the other Euboian poleis and defected from Athens; but the revolt was soon quenched by an Athenian army under Perikles; the Histiaians were expelled from their city and sent to Makedonia, while Histiaia/Oreos was settled with Athenians (Thuc. 1 . 114 . 1 -3 , 7 . 57 . 2 , 8 . 95 . 7 ; Theopomp.fr. 387 ; Philoch. fr. 118 ; Diod. 12 . 7 . 1 , 22 . 2 ; Plut. Per . 23 . 4 ). The Athenians are described as colonists ( apoikoi , Thuc. 7 . 57 . 2 ; Figueira ( 1991 ) 223 ) and numbered 2 , 000 (Theopomp. fr. 387 ) rather than the 1 , 000 reported at Diod. 12 . 22 . 2 , where, probably, κατεκληρουacuteχησαν is used in a non-technical sense (cf.Ael. VH 6 . 1 with Figueira ( 1991 ) 258 -60 ). The Athenian regulations for the new colony include references to a Histiaian boule , a dikasterion and an archon ( IG i³ 41 ; cf. Koch ( 1991 ) 181 -82 , 192 -93 ). They also show that a part of the original population remained in the territory (ibid. 182 -83 ). In 415 a contingent of the Athenian colonists joined the expedition to Sicily (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 2 ), and in 411 Histiaia/Oreos remained loyal and did not join the other Euboian cities in defecting from Athens (Thuc. 8 . 95 . 7 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 33 . 1 ). At the end of the Peloponnesian War, the Athenian colonists in Histiaia/Oreos were undoubtedly among those sent back to Athens (Plut. Lys . 13 . 3 ), and Histiaia/Oreos was probably given back to the citizens expelled in 446 . In the Corinthian War, the Oreitans must have been among the Euboians who fought against Sparta (no. 345 ) in the battle of the Nemea in 394 (Xen. Hell . 4 . 2 . 17 ). In c. 380 Iason of Pherai had a certain Neogenes set up as tyrant of Histiaia/Oreos. Two years later he was deposed by a Lakedaimonian force (Diod. 15 . 30 . 3 -4 ). A Lakedaimonian garrison was placed on the acropolis (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 56 ; Plut. Mor . 773 F). In 377 the Athenians ravaged the territory of Histiaia/Oreos (Diod. 15 . 30 . 2 , 5 ) and later in the same year the Lakedaimonians were expelled from Oreos (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 57 ). Histiaia/Oreos joined the Second Athenian Naval League in 375 or shortly after ( IG ii² 43 .B. 18 ). It left the League after the battle of Leuktra (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 23 ), but joined once again in 357 ( IG ii² 124 . 16 ). The Oreitans provided synedroi for the synedrion and contributed a syntaxis of 5 tal. (Aeschin. 3 . 94 , 100 ). In 340 some kind of short-lived league with a common council was established under the leadership of Kallias of Chalkis (Aeschin. 3 . 89 , 94 ; Staatsverträge 342 ); it included Histiaia/Oreos, Chalkis (no. 365 ) and Eretria (no. 370 ). Because of the contemporary issue of a common Euboian coinage ( supra 643 ) the union has sometimes been interpreted as a federation ( Staatsverträge 342 ; Picard ( 1979 )), but see Beck ( 1997 ) 28 . After the Persian War Histiaia/Oreos was an oligarchy. At one point a dispute between two brothers belonging to the gnorimoi resulted in a stasis in which one brother rallied the wealthy ( euporoi ), the other the commoners ( demotikoi ) (Arist. Pol . 1303 b 31 -37 ; cf. Gehrke, Stasis 73 ). The Athenian colony of 446 or the 420 s (Mattingly ( 1996 ) 246 -48 ) was organised as a democracy ( IG i³ 41 ).After the Peloponnesian War the constitution was an oligarchy, which, in c. 395 , without any stasis or revolution, was changed into a constitution described by Aristotle as a politeia or a demokratia ( Pol . 1303 a 16 -20 ). Apart from a short period of tyranny in 380 -378 under Neogenes (Diod. 15 . 30 . 3 ), the constitution was democratic (Aeschin. 3 . 103 ). In 357 Histiaia/Oreos, like the other the Euboian poleis , was torn by stasis between a pro-Theban and a pro-Athenian faction (Diod. 16 . 7 . 2 ), and in the 340 s Histiaia/Oreos was split between a proMakedonian faction, headed by Philistides and an anti-Makedonian faction, headed by Euphraios, a pupil of Plato (Trampedach ( 1994 ) 96 -97 ). The majority of the Oreitan demos supported the pro-Makedonian faction, and Euphraios was imprisoned (Dem. 9 . 59 -62 ; cf. Ath. 506 E, 508 D). In 342 Philip of Makedon succeeded in making Philistides tyrant of Histiaia/Oreos (Dem. 9 . 33 , 18 . 71 ; Theopomp. fr. 387 ). But a year later, on the motion of Demosthenes, the Athenians sent a force against Histiaia/Oreos; the city was conquered, Philistides killed, and democracy restored (Dem. 18 . 73 ; Charax ( FGrHist 103 ) fr. 19 ; schol. Aeschin. 3 . 85 ). Strabo reports that Philistides during his short reign had the population of Ellopia transferred to Oreos ( 10 . 1 . 3 ; cf. Moggi, Sin . 351 -54 ). The only known public enactment of the Classical period is a decree of the people ( psephisma tou demou ) whereby the Oreitans pledged the public revenue of Histiaia/Oreos as security for 1 tal., which the polis owed to Demosthenes (Aeschin. 2 . 104 and 105 , where the psephisma (now lost) was read out to the jurors; Migeotte ( 1984 ) 244 -45 ). The eponymous officials were a board of six archontes ( SEG 29 817 . 8 -12 ( c. 300 ); IG xii . 9 1187 . 1 -5 (C3m)). A Histiaian citizen is recorded as lending money at interest to the city of Karystos (no. 373 ) ( IG xii . 9 7 . 5 -11 ). An isopoliteia treaty was concluded between Histiaia/Oreos and Keos c. 364 ( IG xii . 5 594 = Staatsverträge 287 ). Athenian envoys were sent to Histiaia/Oreos in 357 / 6 ( IG ii² 124 . 16 ) and in 341 / 40 (Aeschin. 3 . 100 ). Histiaia/Oreos granted proxenia to Aeschines of Athens (no. 361 ) (Dem. 18 . 82 ) and to Kallikles of Larisa (no. 401 ) ( SEG 29 817 ( c. 300 )), and Oreitan citizens received proxenia from Athens (no. 361 ) ( IG ii² 149 . 10 ( c. 375 ); Knoepfler ( 1995 ) 324 ff). Histiaia/Oreos possesssed an extra-urban sanctuary of Artemis Proseoea at Artemision (Hdt. 7 . 176 . 1 ; Plut. Them . 8 . 4 ; Lolling Symposium 1994 , forthcoming); the cult included Pyrrhic games ( SEG 33 716 , C5f; IG xii . 9 1190 ; Ceccarelli ( 1998 ) 94 -95 ); a cult of the nymph Histiaia can be inferred from the C4 coins ( infra ). The exact location of the urban centre of Histiaia is unknown, but it was probably in the neighbourhood of modern Histiaia (Xerochori). After 446 the urban centre was moved to Oreos at modern Kastro, and the inhabitants of the two settlements were merged by an synoikismos (Strabo 10 . 1 . 4 ; Moggi, Sin . 114 -20 ). So far, only scanty remains have been found ( ArchDelt 29 ( 1973 -74 ) 487 -90 ). Weknow from literary sources that the town had an acropolis (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 56 ) and a harbour (Ps.-Skylax 58 ). In the earthquake of 426 , 700 houses and part of the walls were destroyed (Demetrios of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 6 ), but the town was fortified again in C4m (Dem. 9 . 61 ). The stronghold called Metropolis which was fortified by Chabrias in 377 / 6 (Diod. 15 . 30 . 2 , 5 ) may have been the original urban centre of Histiaia/Oreos, deserted after the metoikesis in C5m; see supra 657 . The prison of Oreos is mentioned at Dem. 9 . 60 . In C4m Histiaia/Oreos struck coins of silver and bronze on the Euboian standard. Types: obv . head of nymph Histiaia wearing vine wreath; rev . heifer and vine. Legend: ΙΣΤΙ or, once, ΙΣΤΙΕ . An issue of silver coins on the Attic standard has rev . Histiaia seated on the stern of a ship and holding a naval standard inscribed ΑΘΑΝΑ . Legend: ΙΣΤΙΑΙΕΩΝ (Head, HN ² 364 ; Robert ( 1951 ) 179 ff; Kraay ( 1976 ) 93 -94 ; Picard ( 1979 ) 176 -78 ; SNG Cop. AetoliaEuboea 510 -16 )."
373,Karystos (Karystios),Euboia,38.0,24.25,1634,7516,"373 . Karystos (Karystios) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 00 , long. 24 . 25 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Κάρυστος , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 539 ; Hdt. 4 . 33 . 2 ; Archestratos fr. 51 . 2 ; Eust. Il . 1 . 432 . 7 ; IG xii . 9 207 . 14 (C3e)). Quoting the C3 poet Theodoridas (fr. 746 , Suppl. Hell .), Steph. Byz. lists Χειρωνία as an alternative toponym ( 362 . 14 ); yet another alternative toponym is Αιγαία (Steph. Byz. 363 . 1 ; schol. Ap. Rhod. 1 . 1165 ). The city-ethnic is Καρυacuteστιος (Hdt. 4 . 33 . 2 ; Thuc. 1 . 98 . 3 ; Ar. Lys . 1059 ; IG xii . 9 7 . 20 (C4f)). Karystos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Ps.-Skylax 58 : τετράπολις , where the political sense may be a connotation) and in the political sense ( IG xii . 9 12 . 1 = ArchDelt 26 ( 1971 ) Chron . 262 no. 13 (C5 -C4 ); IG ii² 12 . 11 -12 ; Hdt. 4 . 33 . 2 , where the urban sense may be a connotation).The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in inscriptions ( IG xii . 9 7 . 20 (C4f)) and in abbreviated form on C6 -C4 coins ( infra ), and externally in inscriptions ( I.Délos 98 B. 10 ( 377 -373 )) as well as in literary sources (Hdt. 6 . 99 . 2 ; Thuc. 4 . 42 . 1 ). The individual and external use is attested in inscriptions ( CID ii 4 . iii . 9 (C4f)) as well as in literary sources (Hdt. 7 . 214 . 1 ; Dem. 35 . 8 -10 ). Patris is restored in IG ii² 467 . 21 ( 306 / 5 ). The territory is called ηasper Καρυστίη χώρη (Hdt. 9 . 105 ) or ηasper Καρυστία (Theophr. Hist. pl . 8 . 4 . 4 ). In C4 it bordered on that of Styra (no. 377 ), then an Eretrian deme ( infra 660 ), and comprised the southern part of Euboia,altogether some 450 km ² . The principal site in the territory of Karystos is the harbour of Geraistos with a sanctuary of Poseidon (Ps.Skylax 58 ; Arr. Anab . 2 . 1 . 2 ; Schumacher ( 1993 ) 77 -80 ). The only other known Archaic and Classical settlements are Kyrnos (Hdt. 9 . 105 ) and Marmarion (Strabo 10 . 1 . 6 ), which may have existed in C4 (Knoepfler by letter), and the archaeological sites at Arkhampolis ( Barr . 55 , C, supra 646 ) and Philagra ( Barr . 55 , C, supra 646 -47 ). Coins of C6m ( infra ) and a Panhellenic victor of C6s ( infra ) are the only evidence we have for Karystos before the Persian War. In 490 the Persian forces laid siege to Karystos, ravaged its territory and forced the Karystians to surrender (Hdt. 6 . 99 . 2 ). In 480 the Karystians joined the Persian army (Hdt. 8 . 66 . 2 ), and after Salamis they were forced by Themistokles to pay an indemnity (Hdt. 8 . 112 . 2 ) and had their territory ravaged by the Greek army (Hdt. 8 . 121 . 1 ). Nevertheless, the Karystians dedicated a bronze bull in Delphi from spoils taken in the Persian War (Paus. 10 . 16 . 6 ). In a war between Athens and Karystos c. 476 -469 (Thuc. 1 . 98 . 3 ; Brock ( 1996 ) 359 ), the Karystians were defeated in a battle at Kyrnos (Hdt. 9 . 105 ) and forced to join the Delian League. Karystos belonged to the Island district ( IG i³ 270 . v . 21 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 16 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 22 ), a total of eleven times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 12 tal. in 454 / 3 , reduced to 7½ tal. in 451 / 50 ( IG i³ 262 . i . 23 ), and further reduced to 5 tal. in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 26 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 70 : 5 tal.) and in 410 / 9 ( IG i³ 100 . i . 4 ). In spite of Thuc. 1 . 114 . 2 , the silence of our sources indicates that Karystos did not join the other Euboian poleis in defecting from the Delian League in 446 . But, in addition to the reduction in phoros , there is some archaeological evidence to support the view that one of the C5m Athenian klerouchies on Euboia (Diod. 11 . 88 . 5 ; Paus. 1 . 27 . 3 ; schol. Ar. Nu . 213 ) was placed in Karystos (Figueira ( 1991 ) 225 , y; Brock ( 1996 ) 365 -66 ; Salomon ( 1997 ) 209 ). In 413 Karystos was still listed among the paying members (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 4 ). The constitution of Karystos seems to have been changed into an oligarchy in consequence of the revolution in Athens in 411 (Thuc. 8 . 64 . 1 , 65 . 1 , 69 . 3 ; cf. Gehrke, Stasis 76 ). Karystos was among the original members of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 . 84 ), but probably left the League together with Thebes (no. 221 ) in 371 or shortly afterwards (Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 23 ; Dreher ( 1995 ) 173 ). In 357 Karystos, like the other Euboian poleis , was torn by stasis between a pro-Theban and a pro-Athenian faction (Diod. 16 . 7 . 2 ), and when the Thebans had been expelled from Euboia by the Athenians, a new treaty was concluded between Athens (no. 361 ) and Karystos ( IG ii² 124 ; cf. SEG 45 54 ). It is not known whether Karystos in the 340 s was a member of the ephemeral Euboian league or federation. In 323 / 2 Karystos was the only Euboian polis to support Athens in the Lamian War (Diod. 18 . 11 . 2 ; Paus. 1 . 25 . 4 ). In C4 Karystos had close relations with Histiaia/Oreos (no. 372 ) and Thebes (no. 221 ), and had taken up some loans from citizens of these two poleis . Payments on these loans are attested in an inscription of c. 370 ( IG xii . 9 7 = Migeotte ( 1984 ) no. 73 ) which shows that the eponymous official in Karystos was an archon and that there was a board of tamiai . An undated (C4 -C3 ?) public enactment mentions a board of strategoi and, probably, a popular assembly ( IG xii . 9 1 ). A citizen of Karystos was granted proxenia by Eretria (no. 370 ) in C4l ( IG xii . 9 211 ; cf. Knoepfler ( 2001 ) 212 ). During the grain crisis of 330 -326 Karystos obtained 15 , 000 medimnoi from Kyrene (no. 1028 ) ( SEG ix 2 = Tod 196 . 21 ; cf. SEG 38 1880 ). Karystos was a member of the Delian amphiktyony (Hdt. 4 . 33 . 2 ; I.Délos 98 . 120 ( 377 -373 )) and had a treasury on Delos ( IG xi . 2 144 .A. 88 ). In the Archaic period the urban centre was situated on the Plakari hill (Keller ( 1985 ) 200 -1 ), and it may have remained there during C5 . In C4 , if not before, it was moved to Palaiochori. From the siege of Karystos in 490 it can be inferred that the city was fortified (Hdt. 6 . 99 . 2 ). There are few remains. There was a fortified acropolis (Livy 32 . 17 ) on the Montofoli hill (Keller ( 1985 ) 218 ), and a large cemetery to the south.A temple of Dionysos is attested (Keller ( 1985 ) 217 ). Karystos had one citizen who distinguished himself in all the four major Panhellenic games: viz . Glaukos the pugilist (Simon. fr. 4 , PMG ; Dem. 18 . 319 ) who in 520 won one victory in the Olympic Games ( Olympionikai 134 ), and then two in the Pythian, eight in the Nemean, and eight in the Isthmian Games (Paus. 6 . 10 . 1 -3 ). Karystos struck coins of silver c. 550 -445 and of silver and bronze c. 411 -336 (the chronology is based on the traditional date of the Athenian Coinage Decree and on the belief that Greek poleis stopped minting coins during the Makedonian supremacy). ( 1 ) Silver: denominations: tetradrachm, didrachm,drachm,hemidrachm and fractions down to tritemorion. Types: obv . ox scratching itself with its horns or cow suckling calf or forepart of bull or bull's head; or head of Herakles; rev . incuse square or cock in incuse square or bull or palm tree(s). Legend: ΚΑΡΥΣ or shorter forms down to Κ . The obv . of one Archaic tetradrachm has ΚΑΡΥΣΤΙΟ [ Ν ]. ( 2 ) Bronze in C4 : obv . head of Herakles or head of Athena; rev . bull's head or palm.

374,Orobiai (Orobieus),Euboia,38.5,23.15,490,2350,"374 . Orobiai (Orobieus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 50 , long. 23 . 15 . Size of territory: 1 ? Type: A. The toponym is ' Ορόβιαι , αιasper (Thuc. 3 . 89 . 2 ; IG i³ 418 a. 6 ). The city-ethnic is ' Οροβιευacuteς ( IG xii . 9 923 . 2 -3 ). In the notes to the Budé edn. of Diod. 15 , Vial suggests that ' Ωρωπίων ( 30 . 3 ) and ' Ωρωπίοις ( 30 . 4 ) may be corruptions of ' Οροβίων and ' Οροβίοις . It seems better to obelise the MSS readings and to leave the mystery unsolved. Orobiai is called a polis in the urban sense at Thuc. 3 . 89 . 2 . Orobiai was situated at modern Rovies and was famous for its oracle of Apollo Selinuntios (Strabo 10 . 1 . 3 ; Steph. Byz. 376 . 3 -4 ). At ThuC3 . 89 . 2 Orobiai is described as a polis which was partly engulfed by the great seismic sea wave of 426 . We know from other sources that a large part of Histiaia/Oreos (no. 372 ) was destroyed by the same disaster (Demetrias of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 6 ; Fossey ( 1990 ) 183 -84 ). AnAttic inscription of c. 430 -410 shows that Orobiai was situated in the territory of Histiaia/Oreos (no. 372 ) ( IG i³ 418 a. 6 ). The individual use of the ethnic ' Οροβιευacuteς is attested twice in a C5 inscription ( IG xii . 9 923 . 2 -3 ; AE ( 1963 ) 5 ). Histiaia/Oreos was organised into tribes and demes ( supra 656 ); but the stone inscribed with IG xii . 9 923 was found in Chalkis (no. 365 ), not in the Histiaia/Oreos area, which points to the ethnic being a city-ethnic rather than a demotic. Knoepfler (by letter) suggests that it may be a pierre errante , inscribed by the Athenians settled in Histiaia/Oreos. In Heltic inscriptions from the Histiaia/Oreos area, however, ' Οροβιευacuteς is attested again, and now indisputably as a demotic ( IG xii . 9 1186 . 3 , 1189 . 27 , 37 ). Like Athenai Diades (no. 364 ), Dion (no. 368 ), Poseidion (no. 376 ), and perhaps some others as well, Orobiai may in C5 have been a dependent polis lying inside the territory of Histiaia/Oreos but transformed into a Histiaian deme in the course of C4 or C3 (Hansen ( 1997 ) 31 , ( 2000 ) 209 -10 ). Some ancient remains have been found in the neighbourhood of Palaiochori, Ag. Iannako, but there are a few traces only of the ancient town. It was probably situated at Ag. Ilias north of Rovies where some sherds of C4 have been found (Sackett et al . ( 1966 ) 46 -47 , fig. 5 )."
375,Peraia (Peraeus),Euboia,,,283,1436,"375 . *Peraia (Peraeus) Map 55 . Unlocated. Type: C. The toponym * Περαία is not attested in any source but reconstructed from the demotic Περαεῖς ( IG xii . 9249 B. 138 (C3 )) and the adverbial form Περαόθεν ( IG xii . 9 249 B. 445 ). Peraia was a deme of Eretria (no. 370 ) and is not called a polis in any source, but an analogy with Grynchai (no. 371 ) and Styra (no. 377 ) indicates that it was a polis down to c. 400 . The Eretrian C3e lists of citizens show that the members of three of the demes, viz . Grynchai, Peraia and Styra, did not belong to one phyle but were distributed among all the six phylai (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 396 -403 ). The evidence for Peraia is IG xii . 9 245 A. 11 ( phyle 1 ), 246 A. 6 ( phyle 2 ), 247 . 2 ( phyle 3 ), 249 B. 138 -49 ( phyle 4 ). In the case of Styra and Grynchai the most likely explanation of this anomaly is that both settlements had been poleis which were amalgamated with Eretria in C5l-C4e and integrated into the pre-existing organisation of Eretrian citizens into six tribes. By analogy, it seems reasonable to infer that Peraia too was once a polis which had been absorbed by Eretria c. 400 . By contrast with Grynchai and Styra, however, Peraia is not recorded in the Athenian tribute lists as a member of the Delian League. By letter, Knoepfler suggests as a possibility that Peraia be identical with the ∆ιάκριοι εν Ευβοίαι (no. 367 ), attested as members of the Delian League."
376,Posideion (Posideites),Euboia,39.0,23.2,229,1091,"376 . Posideion (Posideites) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 00 , long. 23 . 20 , but Knoepfler ( 1999 ) 230 n. 3 now suggests locating Posideion further north at modern Helleniko. Size of territory: unknown but presumably 1 or 2 . Type: C. The toponym is Ποσίδειον , τό ( IG i³ 71 . i . 91 -92 ). The city-ethnic is Ποσειδίτης ( IG xii . 9 1189 . 20 , 28 , 39 (C2 )). Posideion is not called a polis in any source, but the attestation of the community in the C5 Athenian assessment decrees is an indication of polis status. Posideion, further described as Ποσίδειον εν ' Ευβοίαι , was assessed for phoros in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 91 -92 : 100 dr.). The only other reference to the community is in a C2 catalogue of citizens of Histiaia/Oreos (no. 372 ), in which Ποσειδίτης appears as a demotic ( IG xii . 9 1189 . 20 , 28 , 39 (C2 )). The change from polis to deme of Histiaia/Oreos may have taken place in C4f (Moggi, Sin . 236 -37 ; see supra 656 ). The precise location is unknown. Philippson ( 1951 ) 577 n. 1 and Sackett et al . ( 1966 ) 42 , followed by Barr ., suggest Vasilika, Palaiokastro."
377,Styra (Styreus),Euboia,38.1,24.15,886,4083,"377 . Styra (Styreus) Map 58 . Lat. 38 . 10 , long. 24 . 15 . Size of territory: unknown but presumably 1 or 2 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Στυacuteρα , τά (Hom. Il . 2 . 539 ; Dem. 21 . 167 ; Strabo 10 . 1 . 6 ). The city-ethnic is Στυρευacuteς (ML 27 . 9 , 479 ; Hdt. 8 . 46 . 4 ; Thuc. 7 . 57 . 4 ). Steph. Byz. 588 . 14 is the only source in which Styra is explicitly called a polis ; but at Hdt. 8 . 46 . 4 it is subsumed under the heading polis , where polis occurs in the political sense (Hdt. 8 . 42 . 1 , 49 . 1 ). Furthermore, the attestation of the community in the Athenian tribute lists is an indication of polis status, as is the peculiar incorporation of the Styreans into all six phylai of Eretria (no. 370 ) ( infra ). The collective and external use of the city-ethnic is attested on the Serpent Column (ML 27 . 9 ), in the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ) and in literature (Hdt. 8 . 46 . 4 ; Thuc. 7 . 57 . 4 ). The individual and external use is attested only as a demotic ( infra ). The exact location of Styra is not known, but it must have been situated near modern Nea Styra (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 365 ; Reber ( 2002 ) 43 -45 ). The size of the territory is unknown. The northern frontier towards Zarex and Dystos (no. 369 ) cannot be determined. The southern frontier, on the other hand, is attested by a boundary stone inscribed on a rock south-east of modern Styra ( ΟΡΟΣ ∆Η [ µ ου ]: Moutsopoulos ( 1982 ) 340 , where the ∆ is misread as a Λ ; cf. Reber ( 2002 ) 45 ). Styra controlled a small island called Aiglea (Hdt. 6 . 107 . 2 ).At Mt.Ag.Nikolas/Kliosi,east of Styra, are the remains of an ancient fortification wall and a gate, probably a fortress for the defence of the southern frontier of Styra and perhaps of the territory of Eretria (Reber ( 2002 )). Cults of Zeus Hypsistos ( IG xii . 959 ) and Zeus Soter ( IG xii . 9 58 ) are attested, as well as a cult of Asklepios ( IG xii . 9 57 (C4 )) and of the Kytherian goddess, i.e. Aphrodite (Knoepfler ( 2001 ) 244 -45 with n. 337 (C4 ?)). In 480 the Styreans provided two triremes at Artemision (Hdt. 8 . 1 . 2 ) and at Salamis (Hdt. 8 . 46 . 4 ). T ogether with Eretria (no. 371 ) they provided 600 hoplites at Plataiai (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 5 ) and are duly recorded on the Serpent Column (ML 27 . 9 ). Styra was a member of the Delian League, and may have been among the original members ( ATL iii. 198 -99 ). It belonged to the Island district ( IG i³ 269 . v . 29 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 28 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . iii . 21 ), a total of eleven times, three times completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 tal. ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 28 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 74 : 2 tal.), and in 413 Styra was still listed among the paying members (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 4 ). Some 500 lead tablets were found in 1860 in the territory of Styra ( IG xii . 9 56 with add. p. 176 ; cf. SEG 42 794 ). They were inscribed in C5f with names,mostly in the nominative. Sometimes another name is added (a patronymic in the nominative?) and/or an abbreviation which presumably indicates a kind of civic subdivision (e.g. ΜΑ or ΜΑΡ , nos. 167 , 210 , 395 , 405 , 433 ). There are signs of reuse. The tablets are probably identification cards of Styrean citizens, to be used for sortition and similar purposes (Masson ( 1992 ) 61 -72 ; Murray ( 1997 ) 499 ). In the Heltic period Styra is attested as a deme of Eretria, belonging to the second district (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 383 , 402 ). The Styreans were divided among all six Eretrian phylai ( IG xii . 9 245 A. 36 , 246 A. 36 , 247 . i . 17 (C3e); cf. Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 393 -400 ). In the Athenian decree of 378 / 7 ( IG ii² 43 ) the Styreans are not listed as members of the Second Athenian Naval League,and the presumption is that the change of status from polis to deme took place in C5l or C4e (Knoepfler ( 1971 ) 242 -44 ; Moggi, Sin . 227 -33 ). During the Lamian War ( 323 / 2 ) Styra was conquered and destroyed by the Athenians (Strabo 10 . 1 . 6 ; cf. Knoepfler ( 1971 )). ## II. The Poleis"
378,Alope  (Alopaios),East Lokris,38.45,22.55,329,1609,"378 . Alope (Alopaios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 45 , long. 22 . 55 (Fossey ( 1990 ) 91 -92 ). Size of territory: probably 1 , perhaps 2 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Αλόπη , ηasper (Thuc. 2 . 26 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is Αλοπαῖος ( IG ix . 1 222 (C3 -C2 ); cf. Lerat ( 1952 ) i. 15 n. 1 ). At Ps.-Skylax 60 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Alope is the last of four toponyms listed between the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πολλαιgrave Λοκροῖς . For a retrospective attestation of polis in the urban sense,see Diod. 12 . 44 . 1 (r 430 ). The only occurrence of the ethnic is external and individual ( IG ix . 1 222 (C3 -C2 )), a grant of proxeny to an Alopaios by Teithronion (no. 194 ). Thuc. 2 . 26 . 2 suggests that the toponym ( Αλόπη ) may have designated the territory as well; a battle ( µ άχη ) was fought there in 431 (ibid.), but apart from that we have no evidence about the territory and only a little about the city. According to Demetrios of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 6 = Strabo 1 . 3 . 20 , Alope suffered seriously from the earthquake of 426 (Fossey ( 1990 ) 183 -84 ). The city was centred on a flat-topped,fortified hill; the polygonal circuit wall has not been dated, but may belong to C6 (ibid. 140 -41 ); it enclosed an area measuring c. 165 × 70 m, within which building remains and Archaic and Classical sherds as well as tiles attest to activity (Pritchett ( 1982 ) 148 -49 ; Fossey ( 1990 ) 91 -92 ). The lower city lay at the northern foot of the hill and shows extensive Archaic and Classical structures (Haas ( 1998 ) 110 -12 )."
379,Alponos (Alponios),East Lokris,38.5,22.35,518,2455,"379 . Alponos (Alponios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 50 , long. 22 . 35 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. Herodotos gives the toponym as Αλπηνοί , οιasper at 7 . 176 . 2 , but as Αλπηνός , ηasper at 7 . 216 ; Αλπωνός is found in Aeschin. 2 . 132 , 138 , and was possibly used by Hellan. fr. 12 ( = Steph. Byz. 78 . 15 -16 ) and Demetrios of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 6 = Strabo 1 . 3 . 20 . An ethnic derived from the latter toponym, Αλπώνιος , is found in CID ii 126 . 1 (C3 ) and Syll . ³ 419 (C3f), both external and individual uses. Alponos is described as a polis at Hdt. 7 . 216 . 2 , but as a kome at Hdt. 7 . 176 . 5 , an inconsistency which is difficult to explain. Another site in the same general area, Anthele (no. 427 ), is similarly described both as a polis (Hdt. 7 . 176 . 2 ) and a kome (Hdt. 7 . 200 . 2 ). So, if there is an explanation, it may be one that is peculiar to this general area, such as the modest size of the settlements. In the case of Alponos, it is also possible that its classification as a kome is a reflection of dependent status (cf. Hansen ( 1995 a ) 73 -75 ), and it may be suggested that the city was dependent on Opous (no. 386 ), the leading city of the East Lokrian 'confederacy'(see infra ). Strangely, though, Steph. Byz. 78 . 12 -13 reports (without source reference) that Alponos was µ ητρόπολις Λοκρῶν . The city served as a base for the Greeks during the Thermopylai campaign (Hdt. 7 . 176 . 5 , 229 . 1 ). Alponos is poorly attested: there is no evidence about its territory, and only a little about the city. According to Demetrios of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 6 , as reported by Strabo 1 . 3 . 20 , Alponos suffered seriously from the earthquake of 426 (Fossey ( 1990 ) 183 -84 ). The fragment, moreover, refers to a pyrgos , which was one of several such constructions at the harbour of Alponos ( πυacuteργον τῶν ελλι µ ενίων ). The reference may indicate that the city was walled (Pritchett ( 1982 ) 160 ). In C5 Alponos was probably centred on a walled acropolis to the east of Thermopylai (for which see Pritchett ( 1982 ) 160 -61 and ( 1992 ) 148 -50 ), but the city was possibly relocated uphill to a new site after the earthquake of 426 (Pritchett ( 1982 ) 164 ; but see Buckler ( 1989 ) 93 -94 ); Pritchett ( 1982 ) 164 -66 describes the probable new site as a walled city. The celebration of Thesmophoria is attested in Demetrios of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 6 = Strabo 1 . 3 . 20 (r 426 )."
380,Halai (Haleeus),East Lokris,35.4,23.1,952,4749,"380 . Halai (Haleeus) Map 55 . Lat. 35 . 40 , long. 23 . 10 . Size of territory: probably 2 . Type: B. The toponym is not found in Archaic or Classical sources,but Strabo 9 . 2 . 13 and 4 . 2 (MS αasperacuteλλαι ) has been emended to read Αasperλαί , αιasper (cf. Plut. Sull . 26 . 3 -4 ; Paus. 9 . 24 . 5 ; Steph. Byz. 68 . 5 ). The ethnic is Αasperλεευacuteς ( AJA 19 ( 1915 ) 442 -44 no. 2 (C5f)). The earliest sources to classify Halai as a polis are two Heltic inscriptions: AJA 19 ( 1915 ) no. 3 . 2 ( 206 / 5 ) and no. 4 . 2 ( 208 / 7 , restored), where the term is used in the political sense; however, the city deserves inclusion in this Inventory as a type B since (i) AJA 19 ( 1915 ) 442 -44 no. 2 (C5f) testifies to the existence of a board of three eponymous archontes (cf. Sherk ( 1990 ) 244 ); (ii) the internal collective use of the ethnic is attested in the same inscription and sub-ethnics are unknown in East Lokris; (iii) the city had a cult of Athena Poliouchos in C6s ( AJA 19 ( 1915 ) 439 -42 no. 1 ); though the polis element of this (and similar) epithet(s) may originally have meant akropolis (Cole ( 1995 ) 301 -5 ), the absence of a proper acropolis at Halai (see infra ) indicates that Poliouchos should here be taken as the 'Possessor of the polis ' , not of the akropolis (Hansen ( 1995 b ) 32 -33 ). Halai must originally have formed part of East Lokris, ⁷ but in C3 the city was part of Boiotia (cf. AJA 19 ( 1915 ) no. 3 ); exactly when the regional affiliation changed is unknown, but it may have been as early as C4m (so Goldman and Walker ( 1915 ) 420 -21 ; cf. Argoud ( 1997 ) 254 ). The evidence on Halai relates mostly to the city, not the territory. The 'acropolis'of Halai 'hardly deserves the name of acropolis, for at no point does it rise more than four metres above the level of the bay' (Goldman ( 1940 ) 382 ; cf. Argoud ( 1997 ) 255 -56 ). This 'acropolis' was fortified, and the preserved remains belong to two main periods of construction. The earlier fortification was built c. 600 or slightly earlier (Goldman ( 1940 ) 430 ; cf. Fossey ( 1990 ) 40 ) at the 'foundation' of the site. Constructed in large rough polygonal blocks of limestone, the wall had an average width of 3 . 10 m and had at least three circular towers. It enclosed c. 0 . 7 ha (calculated on the basis of fig. 6 in Fossey ( 1990 )). This initial fortification was repaired in C5 (McFadden ( 2001 ) 62 ), and the second main period of construction, dating to c. 350 -330 (Goldman ( 1940 ) 396 ; McFadden ( 2001 ) 68 ) or ⁷ This is generally (and rightly) assumed, though no Archaic or Classical source states so explicitly; it can, however, be deduced from Ps.-Skylax 60 , which enumerates the cities of the (East) Lokrians from south to north,beginning with Larymna and ending with Alope; if Larymna was Lokrian,so must Halai,situated between Larymna and Alope, have been. C4l (Fossey ( 1990 ) 41 ; McFadden ( 2001 ) 62 , 68 ) enlarged the enclosed area to c. 0 . 85 ha (Goldman ( 1940 ) 388 ), the new sections being constructed in isodomic ashlar in emplektron . The acropolis was bisected by a street running from north-west to south-east in the Archaic period. Buildings aligned with both the main street and the Archaic fortification wall have been found, suggesting the existence of a substantial Archaic community within the acropolis circuit (Coleman ( 1992 ) 274 -75 ; cf., however, AR ( 1992 -93 ) 49 -50 ). No Classical remains have yet been found on the acropolis (Coleman ( 1992 ) 275 ). The surface survey carried out by the Cornell Halai East Lokris Project team revealed traces of a C4 or Heltic circuit wall surrounding a lower town and enclosing an area of c. 12 -13 ha (Coleman ( 1992 ) 268 with fig. 2 ). The cemetery was situated to the north and east of the acropolis, probably along the main route to the site; here more than 280 graves have been found, with the earliest dating to C6m and several to C5 (Goldman and Walker ( 1915 ) 424 , 429 ; cf. also ArchDelt ( 1987 ) B. 1 Chron . 228 -31 ). The epithet [ Πολ ] ι ˜ οχ [ ος ] is found in a C6s inscription (Goldman ( 1940 ) 401 = AJA 19 ( 1915 ) 439 -42 no. 1 ), from a C6e precinct of Athena on the acropolis that included a small C6e temple. This sanctuary was completely reconstructed in C6l-C5e, and a new splendidly decorated temple was erected on a bastion engaging the western part of the circuit (Goldman ( 1940 ) 452 -54 ; cf. Wren ( 1996 ) 17 -59 , arguing that the temple was destroyed c. 480 , possibly by the Persians); the dedication of the temple is commemorated by AJA 19 ( 1915 ) 442 -44 no. 2 : H αλε ˜ ες ανέθεαν τ ' Αθάναι (C5f). For the possibility of a hero cult of the city-founder on the acropolis, see Wren ( 1996 ) 60 -84 ."
381,Knemi(de)s,East Lokris,38.45,22.5,234,1131,"381 . Knemi(de)s Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 45 , long. 22 . 50 . Size of territory: probably 1 . Type: [A] (?). Knemis was the mountain range dividing Phokis from East Lokris (Oldfather ( 1922 b ) 909 ), but also the name of a promontory (Serv. Aen . iii 399 ). According to Strabo 9 . 4 . 4 , there was on the coast of East Lokris a χωρίον οχυρόν by the name of Κνη µ ῖδες ; in Ps.-Skylax 61 we find the following list of Phokian ( sic ) poleis : Θρόνιον , Κνηtilde µ ις , ' Ελάτεια , Πανοπευacuteς . Unless we accept the emendation proposed above ( 665 ), then, since Thronion (no. 388 ) was in East Lokris (Thuc. 2 . 26 . 2 ), the Knemis listed here may be Strabo's Knemides, and unless Ps.-Skylax has here included a promontory in a list of poleis , which is not at all impossible (cf. Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 140 -42 ), it may be presumed that he has confused the name of the promontory with the name of a settlement (so Oldfather ( 1922 a ) 908 ). If so, he classifies Knemides as a polis . There is, however, no evidence to support this classification. For the probable site, see Pritchett ( 1985 ) 187 -89 with fig. 9 ."
382,Kynos (Kynios),East Lokris,38.45,23.05,404,2062,"382 . Kynos (Kynios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 45 , long. 23 . 05 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. Location: see infra . The toponym is Κυtildeνος , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 531 ). According to Steph. Byz. 393 . 22 -23 , the city-ethnic was Κυacuteνιος or Κυναῖος ; attested only in a Roman-date epitaph from Attika commemorating Αasperρ µ οδία Κυνία ( IG ii² 9118 ). Kynos is called a polis in the urban sense by Hecat. fr. 131 (for which see Hansen ( 1997 ) 17 , 23 -24 ) and by Ps.-Skylax 60 , where, reading Κυtildeνος , ' Οπουtildeς for MS Κυνοσουtildeρος , Kynos then appears as the second of four toponyms listed between the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πολλαιgrave Λοκροῖς . Kynos is poorly documented, and its location is debated. According to Fossey ( 1990 ) 81 , the focus of ancient Kynos was the Pyrgos hill 2 km north of modern Livanates (and the city may have included the sites at Arkitsa and Villovo; cf. Fossey ( 1990 ) 85 -90 ). The Pyrgos hill-top measures 200 × 70 m and is crowned by a Heltic fortification wall; a harbour lies just north of Pyrgos and may have included a temple (Fossey ( 1990 ) 81 -83 ). Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1970 ) 47 reported Archaic and Classical sherds from the Pyrgos area. However, Dakoronia ( 1993 ) 125 -26 suggests that Pyrgos was simply the harbour site of Kynos, while the city proper was at Palaiokastro, 2 . 5 km south-east of Pyrgos: here are 'many rich graves of the Classical period' and an extensive and fortified acropolis which was the centre 'of a large and important town' . According to Demetrios of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 6 apud Strabo 1 . 3 . 20 , Kynos suffered seriously from the earthquake of 426 (Fossey ( 1990 ) 183 -84 ). Late sources such as Strabo 9 . 4 . 2 and Paus. 10 . 1 . 2 describe Kynos as merely the harbour of Opous (no. 386 ), but Oldfather ( 1925 ) 32 believes that Kynos was originally more than that. According to a tradition preserved in Strabo 13 . 1 . 68 , Kanai on Lesbos was a πολίχνιον Λοκρῶν τῶν εκ Κυacuteνου ."
383,Larymna (Larymnaios),East Lokris,38.35,23.15,737,3834,"383 . Larymna (Larymnaios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 35 , long. 23 . 15 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Λάρυ µ να , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 60 ; SGDI 2593 ( 273 )). The cityethnic is Λαρυ µ ναῖος in CIG ii 1936 (Hell.) and Λαρυ µ νευacuteς in IG ix . 1 235 . 4 (C2 -C1 ). In Ps.-Skylax 60 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Larymna is the first of four toponyms listed between the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαιgrave πολλαιgrave Λοκροῖς . IG ix . 1 235 . 6 (Hell.) uses polis in the personal sense; αστός is used about the citizens in IG ix . 1 235 . 3 (Hell.), and πατρίς is applied to the city in BCH 26 ( 1902 ) 330 no. 35 c. 16 (Hell.).The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found abbreviated as ΛΑ on a C4 coin ( infra ). The name and size of the territory are unknown, but it must have included the plain at the bay of Larmes (Fossey ( 1990 ) 22 ). Fossey ( 1990 ) 35 argues that the Classical sites at Bazaráki , probably ancient Αγχόη (for which see Fossey ( 1990 ) 27 -32 ) and Palaiokhóri (for which see ibid. 33 -35 ) situated 2 . 5 km south and 6 km west of Larymna respectively, were'satellites'of Larymna; in that case,Larymna had a territory measuring at least 20 km ² , although it was probably larger. A Heltic metric epitaph includes the expression [ ε ] γ χθονιgrave . . . / Λαρυacute µ νας ( BCH 26 ( 1902 ) 330 no. 35 c. 1 -2 ). Larymna was originally a part of East Lokris (Ps.-Skylax 60 ; SGDI 2593 ( 273 )), but later it ranked as Boiotian (Paus. 9 . 23 . 7 ); exactly when the regional affiliation changed is unknown, but Goldman and Walker ( 1915 ) 420 -21 assume it occurred in C4m; however, SGDI 2593 is a Delphic grant of proxeny from 273 to Ευacuteβιος Αλυacuteπου Λοκροgraveς εγ Λαρυacute µ νας . The pantheon of Larymna is unknown,but Fossey ( 1990 ) 154 suggests that Dionysos was an important divinity here. Larymna is situated in the bay of Larmes and is centred on a small peninsula with a harbour on its south-east (cf. Schäfer ( 1967 ) 540 ; Lawrence ( 1979 ) 472 ; Haas ( 1998 ) 101 -2 ). Anelevation of a few metres height on the peninsula served as 'acropolis' (Schäfer ( 1967 ) 530 ). Fortifications and ancient remains indicate the existence of the ancient settlement on the peninsula and on the mainland, but modern constructions impede observation of the degree of urbanisation; there are both Archaic and Classical sherds at the site (Fossey ( 1990 ) 22 -24 ; see fig. 4 for a plan of the site), enough to indicate 'significant Classical period habitation' (Haas ( 1998 ) 106 ). Schäfer ( 1967 ) 533 suggests that originally the town occupied only the peninsula (i.e. slightly more than 1 ha). This peninsula was fortified, and the remains of fortification date to two different periods. The oldest remains, in 'Cyclopean' and polygonal styles, are possibly late Archaic (ibid. 542 ). The second phase was in isodomic style and probably dates to C4 (ibid.). It seems that the enclosed area was now enlarged to cover land outside the peninsula (see the probable line of the circuit in Schäfer ( 1967 ) Abb. 1 at 528 , indicating that the enclosed area grew to c. 6 . 5 ha). The fortifications at Larymna were all constructed in local breccia stone (Schäfer ( 1967 ) 530 -31 ). The J. Hirsch auction catalogue of 15 May 1905 mentions that the collector attributed two silver coins (nos. 1628 -29 ) to Larymna; no. 1628 is a hemiobol: obv . bearded male; rev . grapes; legend: ΚΡ , which rather suggests [ ΛΟ ] ΚΡ ( ῶν ); but no. 1629 , likewise a hemiobol: obv . beardless youth; rev . grapes,has the rev . legend ΛΑ , which may possibly abbreviate the ethnic of Larymna; Oldfather ( 1908 ) 470 accepts the attribution without discussion and assigns no. 1628 to C4 , and no. 1629 should be contemporary with it."
384,Naryka (Narykaios),East Lokris,38.45,22.45,460,2236,"384 . Naryka (Narykaios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 45 , long. 22 . 45 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: B. The toponym is Ναρυacuteκα , ηasper in IG ix . 1² 3 706 A (C3f); Steph. Byz. 470 . 4 -5 gives Ναtildeρυξ , Ναρυacuteκη and Ναρυacuteκιον , but without source reference (see further Oldfather ( 1935 ) 1773 ); Pritchett ( 1985 ) 169 -71 suggests that Naryka is the descendant of Homeric Tarphe (Hom. Il . 2 . 533 ). The ethnic is Ναρυκαῖος ( IG ix . 1² 3 706 A. 1 (C3f); Diod. 16 . 38 . 5 (r 352 )). Naryka is called a polis in the political sense in IG ix . 1² 3 706 A. 1 (C3f), and in the urban sense at Diod. 16 . 38 . 5 (r 352 ); Lycoph. Alex . 1148 refers to Ναρυacuteκειον άστυ . The internal collective use of the ethnic is found in IG ix . 1² 3 706 A. 1 (C3f), the external use at Diod. 16 . 38 . 5 (r 352 ). The name of the territory is unknown, but Diod. 14 . 82 . 8 ( καταστρατοπεδευacuteσαντος . . . εις Νάρυκα (r 395 )) may suggest that the toponym could designate the territory. According to Pritchett ( 1985 ) 168 -69 , Naryka was an extensive and thriving city in C4 ; he notes that the acropolis 'is covered with blocks and sherds' , and furthermore mentions a possible theatre. In 352 the city was besieged (Diod. 16 . 38 . 5 ) and must thus have been walled; a fortification on the acropolis is briefly mentioned in Pritchett ( 1985 ) 168 -69 . In 352 the city was destroyed by the Phokian Phayllos (Diod. 16 . 38 . 5 : τηgraveν δεgrave πόλιν εasperλωgraveν καταgrave κράτος διήρπασε καιgrave κατέσκαψεν ); however,the city emerges again in C3f in IG ix . 1² 3 706 A.This document is the earliest surviving public enactment of the city: it is a law of Naryka and the Aianteioi laying down regulations concerning the Lokrian Maiden Tribute which went to Ilion to atone for Lokrian Aias' outrage of Kassandra (see e.g. Hughes ( 1991 ) 166 -84 ); Naryka was presumably involved because this city was considered the hometown of Lokrian Aias (Diod. 14 . 82 . 8 ; Strabo 9 . 4 . 4 ; cf., however, Eur. IA 263 -64 , suggesting Thronion (no. 388 ) as the home of Aias). A Λοκρίς Αιαντίς , attested in IG ix . 1² 3 706 A (C3f), is possibly Athena in epichoric dress (Oldfather ( 1935 ) 1775 ; but see Lerat ( 1952 ) ii. 157 )."
385,Nikaia (Nikaeus),East Lokris,38.5,22.35,342,1651,"385 . Nikaia (Nikaeus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 50 , long. 22 . 35 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: C. The toponym is Νίκαια (or possibly Νείκαια , cf. Oldfather ( 1937 ) 222 ), ηasper (Aeschin. 2 . 132 ; Dem. 11 . 4 ; Diod. 16 . 59 . 2 ). The ethnic is given as Νικαευacuteς by Memnon ( FGrHist 434 ) fr. 28 . 10 (rC4l). Nikaia is called a polis in the urban sense by the C3 writer Timosthenes, Peri limenon , quoted verbatim in Didymos In Dem. Comm ., Pearson and Stephens, col. 11 . 33 ; πατρίς is used twice in Memnon ( FGrHist 434 ) fr. 28 . 10 (rC4l); the same fragment uses the ethnic about survivors of the destruction of the city (see infra ). Oldfather ( 1937 ) 225 -26 argues that Nikaia was founded only after 426 and probably in C4 by Thebes (no. 221 ) under Epameinondas;schol.Dem. 11 . 12 calls the city an άποικος of the Thebans. From Didymos In Dem. Comm ., Pearson and Stephens, col. 11 26 -51 , it appears that in C4 the city was held by Philip II and the Thebans at different points, and Phokian occupation is attested by Diod. 16 . 59 . 2 (cf. Pritchett ( 1982 ) 162 ). The site is briefly described in Pritchett ( 1982 ) 162 -66 and Buckler ( 1989 ) 93 -94 . The city was destroyed by the Phokians (Memnon ( FGrHist 434 ) fr. 28 . 10 : the terms used are καταστροφή and αφανισ µ ός ), probably in 353 (Oldfather ( 1937 ) 224 ), but it is referred to again in 339 as held by Thebes (Philoch. fr. 56 b) and is mentioned by Timosthenes as well (see supra ); survivors of the destruction seem to have served with Alexander the Great in Asia (Memnon ( FGrHist 434 ) fr. 28 . 9 ), where they reportedly founded Nikaia in Bithynia (ibid.)."
386,Opous (Opountios),East Lokris,38.4,23.0,1727,8503,"386 . Opous (Opountios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 40 , long. 23 . 00 . Size of territory: 2 or 3 . Type: A. Located at modern Atalandi (Fossey ( 1990 ) 71 -74 ); but see Dakoronia ( 1993 ) 117 -20 . The toponym is ' Οπόεις , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 531 ; Pind. Ol . 9 . 14 ; ML 20 l. 33 ( 500 -450 )) or ' Οπουtildeς (Thuc. 2 . 32 . 1 ; Arist. Hist. an . 576 b 25 ). The city-ethnic is ' Οπόντιος (ML 20 l. 14 ( 500 -450 ; SEG 23 415 ( 450 -425 )) or ' Οποέντιος ( SEG 23 420 (C4 )) or ' Οπουacuteντιος ( CID ii 97 . 25 ( 327 / 6 )). Opous is called a polis in the political sense by Pind. Ol . 9 . 21 and in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 60 , where, reading Κυtildeνος , ' Οπουtildeς for MS Κυνοσουtildeρος , Opous then appears as the third of four toponyms listed between the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πολλαιgrave Λοκροῖς . πολῖται is found in Arist. fr. 561 , Rose, which Rose believes is a Plutarchean paraphrase of a passage in Aristotle's ' Οπουντίων πολιτεία (Rose frr. 560 -64 ); µ ητρόπολις is applied to Opous in a C5 inscription quoted by Strabo 9 . 4 . 2 ; Klio 15 ( 1918 ) 66 no. 94 (cf. AM 67 ( 1942 ) 269 ( 345 -310 )), and CEG ii 651 (C4 ?) use πατρίς and ακρόπολις is found in the latter as well. άστυ is found Pind. Ol . 9 . 42 (cf. Gerber ( 2002 ) ad loc .). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4 coins (Head, HN ² 336 ), whereas the use of ' Οπόντιος in ML 20 ( 500 -450 ) is ambiguous: it may be used to refer to the East Lokrians in general (Larsen ( 1968 ) 51 ), or it may be the city-ethnic of Opous (Nielsen ( 2000 ) 111 ff). The external collective use is found in Ar. Av . 152 ; Tod 196 . 25 -26 ( 330 -326 ); and IG ii² 572 . 6 (C4l). The external individual use is found in SEG 27 18 . 5 ( 352 / 1 ), SEG 27 18 -19 (C4m) and SEG 23 420 (C4 ). Opous was without doubt the leading city of East Lokris and the centre or 'capital'of the East Lokrian 'confederacy' , as is clearly borne out by ML 20 ( 500 -450 ) (Gschnitzer ( 1958 ) 56 -59 ; Larsen ( 1968 ) 51 -54 ; Nielsen ( 2000 ) 109 -14 , all commenting on the inscription); Opous may even have turned the other East Lokrian poleis into dependencies (Nielsen ( 2000 ) 111 ff, and supra under Alponos (no. 379 )). Evidence confirming this Opountian predominance is found in an inscription from Thermopylai quoted by Strabo 9 . 4 . 2 in which Opous is called µ ηρόπολις Λοκρῶν ; the epigram commemorates warriors who died υasperπεgraveρ ' Ελλάδος αντία Μήδων , and so probably dates to C5 (see further Lorenz ( 1976 ) no. 9 and Molyneux ( 1992 ) 182 -83 ); Pindar, too,in Ol . 9 . 20 calls Opous Λοκρῶν . . . µ ατήρ , and the fragments of the Aristotelian ' Οπουντίων πολιτεία likewise point to Opountian predominance within Lokris; thus, frr. 561 -62 , Rose, relate myths about how West Lokrian cities were founded from Opous. Furthermore, CIG ii 789 ( 312 -280 ) closely associates Opous and the Lokrians as if there was no difference between these two entities, and finally, as pointed out supra , all C4 hieromnemones from East Lokris came from Opous. See also infra on coins. It was certainly this predominance that gave rise to the literary expression Lokroi hoi Opountioi (Nielsen ( 2000 ) 102 ). At Ol . 9 . 15 Pindar describes Opous as the possession of Θέ µ ις θυγάτηρ τέ οιasper σώτειρα . . . µ εγαλόδοξος Ευνο µ ία (Gerber ( 2002 ) 28 ), thus pointing to an oligarchic or aristocratic constitution in Opous; it is also possible that Aristotle at Pol . 1287 a 5 -8 refers to Opous as an example of aristokratia ; Aristotle here points out that πολλοιgrave ποιουtildeσιν εasperacuteνα κυacuteριον τηtildeς διοικήσεως , and gives Opous as an example of this; he adds, however, that at Opous this was κατά τι µ έρος έλαττον 'to a certain smaller extent' (Newman ad loc .). Another official is mentioned by Plutarch: Quaest. Graecae 293 b 11 mentions a κριθόλογος among the Opountians; there is no indication of the date,but the passage may rely on Aristotle's ' Οπουντίων πολιτεία or Philippos of Opous' (C4 ) Περιgrave Λοκρῶν τῶν ' Οπουντίων ( RE xix. 2354 -55 ; Giesen ( 1901 ) 465 -66 and Lasserre ( 1987 ) 600 .) Envoys of the city are mentioned in IG ii² 572 . 9 (C4l) (an honorary decree for [ πρέσ ] βεις ). SEG 23 415 ( 450 -425 ) is a grant of proxeny by Thessalian Pherai (no. 414 ) to a citizen of Opous; SEG 23 420 is one of C4 . The earliest surviving enactment of the city itself (i.e. apart from ML 20 ) is IG ix . 1 268 (Hell.), a grant of proxeny that refers to an eponymous archon and possibly to the assembly and council. CEG ii 651 (C4 ?) refers to the ακρόπολις ; for the poor remains of what is probably the acropolis, see Fossey ( 1990 ) 68 -70 . According to Diod. 19 . 78 . 5 , Opous was subjected to a poliorkia in 313 . The existence of an extensive C4l-C3fortification wall is now securely established (Dakoronia ( 1993 ) 120 with fig. 4 at 122 ). There are Archaic and Classical sherds at Opous (Fossey ( 1990 ) 70 ). Inside the wall, remains of Classical buildings have been found, enough to establish that the site was 'a great city' (Dakoronia ( 1993 ) 120 ). For two kilns that seem to have been producing in C4l, see Lambropoulou ( 1983 ). According to Demetrios of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 6 apud Strabo 1 . 3 . 20 , Opous suffered seriously from the earthquake of 426 (Fossey ( 1990 ) 183 -84 ). The city received grain from Kyrene in 330 -326 (Tod 196 . 26 ). On a C4 ( IG ix . 1 280 ) statue base, Dionysos and Apollo are mentioned, and presumably they were honoured by the dedication. Opous seems to have celebrated Aianteia ; cf. Pind. Ol . 9 with scholia. Promanteia is granted to a man of Opous by F.Delphes iii . 1 92 ( 318 -306 ). An Opountian won the Olympic pankration contest in 536 (Moretti no. 119 ); Νικέας Λοκροgraveς εξ ' Οπουtildeντος won the stadion race in 500 (Dion. Hal. AR 5 . 50 . 1 ); and Pind. Ol . 9 was composed for Epharmostos of Opous, who won the Olympic wrestling contest in 468 ( FGrHist 415 fr. 1 . 38 ) and in addition achieved victories in the three other Panhellenic games (Pythian: Ol . 9 . 12 , 17 ; Isthmian: Ol . 9 . 84 -86 ; Nemean: Ol . 9 . 87 ; with Gerber ( 2002 ) ad locc. citt .) as well as in numerous other games (Pind. Ol . 9 . 88 ff lists victories at Argos, Athens, Mt. Lykaion and Pellene). Also in 468 , Menalkes of Opous was victorious at Olympia in boxing ( FGrHist 415 fr. 1 . 39 ). According to the schol. 123 c Pind. Ol . 9 ., the Isthmionikian (Pind. Ol . 9 . 84 ) athlete Lampromachos was also proxenos of Thebes (no. 221 ) at Opous in C5f (Gerber ( 2002 ) 57 -58 with refs.). Plut. De Pyth. or. 401 f 5 ff mentions a C4 dedication at Delphi by the Opountians. Opous struck coins from C5 onwards. From C5 come silver trihemiobols and obols on the Aiginetan standard: obv . amphora; rev . Ο in incuse square (Babelon, Traité ii. 3 nos. 423 -44 ). C4silver coins ( obv . amphora with grapes, ΟΠΟΝ ; rev . star; Babelon, Traité ii. 3 nos. 436 , 436 bis ) are similar and confirm that the C5 coins belong to Opous. It is interesting that coins of the same appearance are struck, in the name not of the Opountians, but of the Lokrians; thus a coin of, probably, C5 has the amphora on the obv ., and Λ ( οκρῶν ) in a border of dots on the rev . (Babelon, Traité ii. 3 no. 425 ). The legend confirms the impression that there was no real difference between the two entities of 'Opous' and 'the Lokrians' . Similarly, the C4 coins inscribed ΟΠΟΝ ( supra ) have close parallels in later coins inscribed ΛΟ or ΛΟΚΡ (Babelon, Traité ii. 3 nos. 442 -43 ). One coin even has the legend ΟΠΟΝ on the obv . and ΛΟ ( κρῶν ) on the rev . (Babelon, Traité ii. 3 no. 435 ). In C4 Opous struck a wellknown series of silver coins: obv . head of Demeter r.or l.; rev . Lokrian Aias in fighting attitude; legend: ΟΠΟΝΤΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 336 fig. 190 ). These coins, again, are paralleled later in C4 by coins inscribed ΛΟΚΡΩΝ (Babelon, Traité ii. 3 no. 451 ), or ΛΟΚΡΩΝ ΥΠΟ ( κνη µ ιδίων ) (Babelon, Traité ii. 3 nos. 438 , 439 -41 ), again suggesting that 'Opous' , 'the Lokrians' and 'the Hypoknemidian Lokrians' were more or less the same thing.A C4s issue of bronze coins have obv . Athena; rev . grapes; legend: ΟΠΟΝΤΙΩΝ or ΛΟΚΡΩΝ (Head, HN ² 336 -37 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 3 nos. 362 -78 ; SNG Cop.Aetolia-Euboea 42 -58 ). The foundation myth of Opous is reinterpreted by Pindar in Ol . 9 (for which see the Introduction in the translation by Nisetich ( 1980 ) 122 -23 )."
387,Skarpheia (Skarpheus),East Lokris,,,394,1814,"387 . Skarpheia (Skarpheus) Unlocated, but presumably in the plain of Molos (Pritchett ( 1982 ) 166 -67 , ( 1992 ) 145 -48 ; Buckler ( 1989 ) 94 -95 ). Type: B. The toponym is Σκάρφη , ηasper in Hom. Il . 2 . 532 ; Σκάρφεια , ηasper is found in Lycoph. Alex. 1147 , Strabo 1 . 3 . 20 and BCH 45 ( 1921 ) col. iii . 139 ( 230 -210 ); see further Oldfather ( 1929 ) 460 -61 . Σκαρφευacuteς is the ordinary form of the city-ethnic and is found in CID ii 43 . 65 ( 340 / 39 ) and Syll . ³ 270 ( 335 / 4 ), and C4 coins carry the legend ΣΚΑΡΦΕΩΝ (Head, HN ² 337 ). On the basis of Steph. Byz. 574 . 3 , [ Σκ ] αρφ [ αῖ ] ος has been tentatively restored in IG ii² 3045 (C4m); Σκαρφαιευacuteς is found in Anth. Pal . 7 . 639 . 4 . The earliest source to describe Skarpheia as a polis is IG ix . 1² 3 750 . 5 of C2f, but the external individual use of the ethnic is found in CID ii 43 . 65 ( 340 / 39 ) and Syll . ³ 270 ( 335 / 4 ), a Delphic grant of proxeny,etc.,to citizens of Skarpheia,while the internal collective use is attested on C4 coins, and the external use in C3m ( CID ii 130 . 2 ). If Demetrios of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 6 is correctly reported at Strabo 1 . 3 . 20 , then 1 , 700 persons ( σώ µ ατα χιλίων καιgrave εasperπτακοσίων ουκ ελάττω ) living in Skarpheia were drowned during the great earthquake of 426 (Fossey ( 1990 ) 183 -84 ). It is impossible to know how precise this figure is, and if precise, how many of the victims were of citizen status. The earliest reference to a public enactment by the city is I . Magnesia 31 . 3 . 9 (C3l). Skarpheia struck bronze coins in C4 : obv . Lokrian Aias, legend: ΣΚΑΡΦΕΩΝ ; rev . female head (Head, HN ² 337 ; SNG Cop. Aetolia-Euboea 81 ). Hsch. Ε 7145 . 1 mentions Demeter Euryodeia, but that completes the information on the pantheon of Skarpheia."
388,Thronion (Thronieus),East Lokris,38.45,22.45,381,1770,"388 . Thronion (Thronieus) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 45 , long. 22 . 45 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Θρόνιον , τό (Hom. Il . 2 . 533 ; Thuc. 2 . 26 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is Θρονιευacuteς ( CID ii 31 . 79 (C4l)), abbreviated to ΘΡΟΝΙ on C5 coins (Head, HN ² 337 ). Steph. Byz. 318 . 12 furthermore gives Θρόνιος , which is possibly used in SEG 30 42 . 2 ([ Θρ ] ονίοισι ( c. 450 )). Thronion is called a polis in the urban sense by Eur. IA 264 ( Θρονιαgraveς πόλις ) and by Ps.-Skylax 61 , where Thronion is the first of four toponyms listed between the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πόλεις αυτοῖς εν µ εσογείΩsubiotaα , but see the remarks supra 665 ); cf. also Diod. 12 . 44 . 1 (r 431 ); the earliest use of polis in the political sense is in a C3l inscription from Tenos, but this is wholly restored ( IG xii . 5 812 . 9 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found in abbreviated form on C5 coins (Head, HN ² 337 ); the external collective use is possibly attested in SEG 30 42 . 2 ([ Θρ ] ονίοισι , c. 450 ). The external individual use is found CID ii 31 . 79 , 32 . 37 , 97 . 25 (C4 ). The name of the territory is unknown; it is termed ηasper τῶν Θρονιέων χώρα at Polyb. 9 . 41 . 11 , and a strip of coast belonging to it is referred to at 18 . 9 . 3 ; according to Strabo 9 . 4 . 4 , there was a limen here.According to Hom. Il . 2 . 533 and Theopomp.fr. 298 ( apud Harp. s.v . Θρόνιον ) and (implicitly) Thuc. 2 . 26 , Thronion was a Lokrian city, but Ps.-Skylax lists it in his Phokian chapter ( 61 ), presumably a reflection of the Phokian annihilation of the town in 353 (Diod. 16 . 33 . 3 ); however, see supra 665 for another explanation of this passage. ## II.

389,AkyphasΠndos,Doris,38.4,22.2,415,2023,"389 . AkyphasΠndos Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 40 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory 1 . Type: B. Of the two toponyms, Πίνδος , ηasper is the more common (Hdt. 8 . 43 . 1 ; Plin. HN 4 . 28 : Pindus; Strabo 9 . 4 . 10 adds τινεgraveς δ ' Ακυacuteφαντα λέγουσι τηgraveν Πίνδον ). The toponym Ακυacuteφας is attested in Theopompos ( FGrHist 115 ) fr. 364 . There is no city-ethnic matching the toponym Pindos, but the city-ethnic Ακυφάνιος is attested in Heltic inscriptions ( SEG 27 123 . 12 ( 191 / 0 ), restored in IG ix 1 227 (C2f); Rousset ( 1989 ) 223 ). Pindos is implicitly classified as a polis by the term τετράπολις used by the unnamed historians quoted by Strabo at 10 . 4 . 6 . Ps.-Skymnos 594 counts Pindos as the fourth Dorian polis ; and Strabo 9 . 4 . 10 lists four poleis : Erineos, Boion, Pindos and Kytinion. Quoting Theopompos (( FGrHist 115 ) fr. 364 ) Steph. Byz. 66 . 3 -4 classifies Akyphas as a Dorian polis ; we cannot be sure, however, that the site-classification polis is part of the quote. At Strabo 9 . 5 . 10 Akyphas is placed in Oitaia. The individual and external use of the city-ethnic Ακυφάνιος is attested in a Delphic inscription (Rousset ( 2002 ) 252 . 12 ( 191 / 0 )). It is also restored in two C2f inscriptions, one from Phokis mentioning some Oitaian magistrates ( IG ix 1 227 ; cf. BCH 113 ( 1989 ) 223 ), the other from Pharsalos ( Inscriptions de Thessalie , i: Vallée de l'Énipeus ( 1995 ) no. 101 ). It seems that the city called sometimes Pindos,sometimes Akyphas,changed its regional affiliation a couple of times.It was probably not part of Doris in C5s, when the region had only three cities (Thuc. 1 . 107 . 2 ; Diod. 11 . 79 . 4 ). It became part of Doris in C4 (Theopomp. and Ps.-Skymnos). By C2s it belonged to Oitaia ( IG ix 1 227 ), but may have become Dorian once again at the end of the Heltic period (Strabo 9 . 4 . 10 ); see Rousset ( 1989 ) 231 -3 , ( 1994 ) 367 . The only remains of the urban centre are a section of an undated defence circuit (Rousset ( 1989 ) 217 )."

Byz. 172 . 18 ), and some later authors also use the form Βοῖον (Strabo 9 . 4 . 10 ) or Βοιαί (Steph.Byz. 172 . 19 ). In inscriptions the toponym, not attested before C1 , is Βοαί ( CID v 826 ). The individual and external form of the cityethnic Βοαῖος is found from C2e onwards ( CID v 6 ). Βοιαῖος is attested in Ephoros (( FGrHist 70 ) fr. 231 ). Boion is classified as a polisma at Thuc. 1 . 107 . 2 , but a few lines further on polis is used synonymously with polisma . Andron ( FGrHist 10 ) counts Erineos among the three poleis of the Dorians (fr. 16 a: τρίπολις ); cf. also Diod. 11 . 79 . 4 -6 (r 457 ). The only remains of the urban centre are a section of an undated defence circuit with a tower (Rousset ( 1989 ) 213 )."

The toponym is Κυτίνιον , τό (Thuc. 1 . 107 . 2 , 3 . 95 . 1 , 102 . 1 ; Aeschin. 2 . 116 ) or, in inscriptions, Κυτένιον , τό ( IG vii 3055 . 12 (C4m)). The city-ethnic is Κυτινιευacuteς ( CID ii 102 . i . 47 ( 324 )) or Κυτενιευacuteς ( CID ii 123 . 10 (C3f)). Kytinion is classified as a polisma at Thuc. 1 . 107 . 2 , but a few lines further on polis is used synonymously with polisma . Andron ( FGrHist 10 ) counts Kytinion among the three poleis of the Dorians (fr. 16 a: τρίπολις ); cf. Diod. 11 . 79 . 4 -6 (r 457 ). The earliest mention of a πόλις τῶν Κυτενιέων in epigraphical sources is in IG ix² . 1 68 (C3 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in some C2m proxeny decrees ( SEG 40 440 -2 ) and externally on a statue base from Thermos ( IG ix² . 1 68 (C3 )). The city-ethnic is attested in the individual and external sense at CID ii 102 . i . 7 ( 324 )). Being mentioned more frequently in the sources than the neighbouring Dorian poleis , Kytinion was probably the most important of the poleis . The only remains of the urban centre are a section of an undated defence circuit with a tower (Rousset ( 1989 ) 208 ). On remains of the urban centre, see Rousset ( 1999 ) 73 . ## II.

393,Amphanai (Amphanaieus),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.2,22.55,468,2424,"393 . Amphanai (Amphanaieus) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 20 , long. 22 . 55 . Size of territory: ? Type: [A]. The toponym is Α µ φαναί , αιasper (Hecat. fr. 3 ) or Α µ φαναία , ηasper (Theopomp. fr. 54 ) or Α µ φαναῖον , τό (Ps.-Skylax 64 ). A city-ethnic is attested only in late sources: IG ix . 1 227 . 5 (C2 ) has [ Α µ ] φάνιος ; Polemon 1 ( 1929 ) 126 -27 no. 423 (C2s) has Α µ φαναιευacuteς ; Steph. Byz. 89 . 5 adds Α µ φαναῖος to the latter. In Ps.-Skylax 64 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Amphanaion is the first of nine toponyms listed between the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πόλεις Θετταλῶν . The city remains unlocated, though the palaiokastro of Sesklou, proposed by di Salvatore ( 1994 ) 115 -16 , seems the best candidate ( infra ). Several locations have been proposed for Amphanai. ( 1 ) Soros, above Alykes Volou, proposed by e.g. Stählin ( 1924 a ) 68 ; Indzesiloglou ( 1994 ) 46 ; and Triantophyllopoulou ( 2000 ), followed by Barr . Soros has commonly been identified with Amphanai, but recent excavations ( AAA 7 ( 1974 ) 60 -75 ) have made it more likely that Soros is to be identified with Pagasai; cf. Marzolff ( 1994 b ) 274 n. 10 . ( 2 ) Damari or Velanidia, proposed by Bakhuizen ( 1987 ) 323 n. 2 . ( 3 ) Palio-Alikes, proposed by Marzolff ( 1994 a ) 70 n. 6 . ( 4 ) The palaiokastro Sesklou, proposed by di Salvatore ( 1994 ) 115 -16 . It would be reasonable to begin by locating the harbour. The harbour must have been situated on the southern shore of the peninsula terminated by Cap Ankistri. The site most suitable for a harbour is found at the inlet of Chrysi Akti Panaghia (formerly Kandir Aga). The urban centre proper must be sought in the hinterland at a place which satisfies the socio-economic needs of the community; the site at Palio Alikes does not fulfil this requirement, and the palaiokastro Sesklou is a preferable site within reasonable distance of the proposed location of the harbour. Hekataios may have described Amphanai as a Dorian city ( FGrHist 1 fr. 3 = Steph. Byz. 89 . 4 -5 ), but presumably in reference to the Heroic Age (cf. Jacoby, comm. ad loc .; cf. however Helly ( 2001 b ), dating it to the early first millennium). Ps.-Skylax 64 puts it in Thessalia (Pelasgiotis; cf. infra on Pagasai). Philip II of Makedon presumably handed over Amphanai (with Pagasai) to the Magnesians (see the entry for Pagasai)."

The toponym is Αacuteργισσα , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 738 ), later Αacuteργουσσα (Strabo 9 . 5 . 19 : Αacuteργισσα , ηasper νυtildeν Αacuteργουσσα ); Steph.Byz. 113 . 19 (followed by Barr .) mistakenly gives Αacuteργουρα , presumably by confusion with the Euboian Argoura mentioned at 114 . 1 (Knoepfler ( 1981 ) 315 -16 ). The city-ethnic is Αργουacuteσσιος ( IG ix² 1 . 1 31 .A. 103 ; cf. SEG 33 447 (C3 )). NoArchaic or Classical source calls Argoussa a polis , but it deserves inclusion in this Inventory as a probable polis on account of the C5f inscription published in ArchEph ( 1934 -35 ) 140 -45 (cf. Helly ( 1979 a )): it describes itself as a θεθ µ ός of the damos (l. 1 ), refers to a local board of tagoi (ll. 7 -8 ) and to Athena Polias (ll. 11 -12 ). Cf. Helly ( 1995 ) 30 -31 . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found in the abbreviated legends ( ΑΡΓ ) of C3 coins (Franke ( 1955 )). The external individual use is found in IG ix² 1 . 1 31 .A. 103 (cf. SEG 33 447 ), a C3l grant of politeia by the Aitolians to a citizen of Argoussa. Argoussa was situated in the tetras of Pelasgiotis (Strabo 9 . 5 . 19 ). At the site are remains of a C5 -C4 isodomic circuit wall with square towers; the agora has been located, and temples identified ( AA ( 1955 ) 191 -219 , ( 1956 ) 166 -79 , ( 1957 ) 37 -51 , ( 1959 ) 74 -76 ). The ceramic material covers C7 to the third century ad (Hanschmann ( 1981 ) 120 ). In addition to Athena Polias, Heltic dedications attest to cults of Apollo Pythios and Artemis (Helly ( 1979 a ) 250 )."

The toponym is Αacuteτραξ , -αγος ( SEG 34 560 . 3 ( c. 450 ); IG iv 617 . 7 ( 316 -293 )) or ακος (Strabo 9 . 5 . 20 ; Steph. Byz. 143 . 5 -10 ); Steph. Byz. 143 . 5 also has Ατρακία . The Epidaurian catalogue of theorodokoi , IG iv² . 1 94 .b. 3 ( 360 / 59 ), has the unique nominative form Αacuteδρακος (cf. Perlman ( 2000 ) 178 , E. 1 b. 3 ). The city-ethnic is Ατράγιος (C4f coins ( infra ); CID ii 100 . ii . 5 ( 325 ); Tod 196 . 24 ( 330 -326 )); Ατράκιος (cf. Suda s.v. Κιλίκιος ) and Αacuteτραξ are given as variant forms by Steph. Byz. 143 . 7 . Atrax is called a polis in the political sense in a funerary epigram of c. 450 ( SEG 34 560 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4f coins ( infra ), the external collective use in Tod 196 . 24 ( 330 -326 ), and the external individual use in CID ii 100 . ii . 5 ( 325 ). Atrax was a Thessalian community (Marcadé, Signatures i no. 35 (C4m)), situated in the tetras of Pelasgiotis (Steph. Byz. 143 . 5 ). Prior to the expansion of the Thessalians, the area was Perrhaibian (Strabo 9 . 5 . 19 -20 ). To the north its territory was bounded by that of Phalanna, and to the north-east by that of Argoussa; and to the south-east by Krannon. A board of tagoi is attested by SEG 45 553 (C6 -C5 ) (Helly ( 1995 ) 31 -32 , 148 ). SEG 27184 (C4e) lists άρχοντες (cf. SEG 35 494 ). During the crisis of 330 -326 Atrax received 10 , 000 medimnoi of grain from Kyrene (Tod 196 . 24 ). A survey by the Institut Courby and the ephorate of Larisa in 1977 produced evidence of public architecture, all presumably of C4 and Heltic times, including remains of sanctuaries of unidentified divinities (cf. infra on cults) as well as remains of a theatre. In C5e the acropolis and the slope of the hill were enclosed by a polygonal circuit, which was rearranged in C4m in connection with new construction work. C4saw reconstruction on the summit of the acropolis: a quadrangular main tower and strengthening by a new wall with five towers, one of them including a fortified gate. The eastern part of the wall on the slope was reinforced by serration dated to C4m on account of its similarity with constructions at Halos (Reinders ( 1988 ) 54 ). The lower city proper was enclosed by a C4 isodomic wall with quadrangular towers. The wall ran for 3 km and enclosed an area of c. 64 ha. The main gate was to the north-west above the level of the plain, and access was provided by a long ramp supported by a polygonal retaining wall. Attested cults include those of Apollo Hebdomaios ( SEG 33 454 (C4 -C3 )), Athena Agoraia ( SEG 27 184 (C5 )), Themis Agoraia ( SEG 27 183 (C5 )), Zeus Kataibates ( ArchDelt 48 ( 1993 ) Chron . 255 no. 27 (C4 ); SEG 47 674 ), Zeus Thaulios ( SEG 32 569 ( 450 -425 )), Zeus Homoloios ( SEG 35 493 (C5 )) and Zeus Tritodios ( SEG 34 494 ( c. 300 )). IG iv² . 1 94 b. 3 ( 360 / 59 ) lists a man of Atrax as theorodokos of Epidauros (Perlman ( 2000 ) 178 ). IG iv 617 . 7 ( 316 -293 ) records a monetary donation by Atrax 'to the θεωροί sent out from Argos to announce the celebration of the Nemean Games and the Heraia'(Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 , 127 -29 ). Cf. CID ii 100 . ii . 5 ff ( 325 ), presumably a collective donation towards the rebuilding of the temple at Delphi. Atrax struck coins in both silver and bronze from C4f.

The toponym is Γόνφοι , οιasper ( IG iv 617 . 10 ( 316 -293 )) and Γό µ φοι ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 32 ( 230 -220 ); App. B Civ . 2 . 10 . 64 ); the city-ethnic is Γο µ φευacuteς (C4m coins, infra ) or Γο µ φίτης (C4l coins, infra ). According to Steph. Byz. 666 . 7 , the name was changed to Φίλιπποι , and this is borne out by C4m coins inscribed ΦΙΛΙΠΠΟΠΟΛΙΤΩΝ ( infra ); Livy 39 . 25 has Philippopolis , presumably a reference to Gomphoi. NoArchaic or Classical source calls Gomphoi a polis , but it may be included here on account of its C4 coins and its monetary donation 'to the θεωροί sent out from Argos to announce the celebration of the Nemean Games and the Heraia'( IG iv617 . 10 (C4l); cf. Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 , 127 -29 ); in addition, the use of -πολίτας for the city-ethnic of the renamed community may be significant. Later sources variously describe it as a polis ( IG ix . 2 287 (C1 ); Plut. Caes . 41 . 7 ; App. B Civ . 2 . 10 . 64 ), as a polichne (Cass. Dio 41 . 51 . 4 ) and as a phrourion (Strabo 9 . 5 . 17 ). The only attested Classical usage of the city-ethnic is the internal collective use found on C4 coins ( infra ). Gomphoi was situated in Thessalia (Plut. Caes . 41 . 7 ), more specifically in Hestiaiotis (Strabo 9 . 5 . 17 ). It is located at Episkopi (Turkish Rapsista), about 5 km north-east of Mouzaki and 10 km south-west of Trikala, on the eastern side of Mt. Kerketion, close to the border with Epeiros (Caes. B Civ . 3 . 80 ), i.e. via Athamania. The remains at the site, which include foundations of public buildings, fortifications and habitation, are essentially of Roman date. Gomphoi struck coins of silver and bronze from C4m onwards. ( 1 ) Silver, C4m. Denominations: didrachm and drachm on the Aiginetan standard. Types: obv . head of Hera facing; rev .

The city-ethnic is Γυρτώνιος (Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 ; IG i³ 92 . 6 ( c. 416 ); CID ii 31 . 72 ( 345 / 4 )), or Κυρτώνιος ( CID ii 102 . ii .B. 20 ( 324 / 3 ), 119 (C4l)). Gyrton is listed as a polis in the political sense at Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 ; it is called άστυ in a mythological context in Orphica Argonautika 145 . The internal collective use of the city-eth- nic is found on C4 coins ( infra ); the external collective use is found in Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 ; the external individual use is found in e.g. IG i³ 92 ( c. 416 ) and CID ii 31 . 72 ( 345 / 4 ), 85 ( 344 / 3 ). The mythological people Phlegyai were associated with Gyrton (Pherecydes ( FGrHist 3 ) fr. 41 e), and Strabo describes it as both Perrhaibian and Magnesian ( 7 a. 1 . 14 , 9 . 5 . 19 ; cf. Steph. Byz. 215 . 20 ); however, by the Classical period Gyrton was definitely a Thessalian community (Thuc. 2 . 22 . 2 -3 ; IG i³ 92 ( c. 416 )) in the tetras of Pelasgiotis. A citizen of Gyrton was awarded hereditary proxenia by Athens in c. 416 ( IG i³ 92 ). In 360 / 59 , a citizen of Gyrton served as Epidaurian theorodokos ( IG iv² . 1 94 b. 4 ). For citizens of Gyrton serving the Amphiktyonic League as naopoioi , see CID ii 31 . 72 ( 345 / 4 ), 85 ( 344 / 3 ), 74 . i . 67 ( 337 / 6 ), 75 . ii . 41 ( 336 ), 76 . ii . 16 ( 335 ), 79 A. i . 10 ( 334 / 3 ), 102 . ii .B. 20 ( 324 / 3 ). A Gyrtonian cavalry contingent and its commanders ( άρχοντες ) are mentioned at Thuc. 2 . 22 . 2 -3 . Both the acropolis and the lower city were fortified, possibly already in the Archaic period, and both fortifications were built of slate (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 88 -89 (the site is not identified as Gyrton here)). A cult of Zeus may be inferred from C4s coin types ( infra ). Gyrton struck coins of silver and bronze in C4 .

The toponym is Κιέριον , τό ( IG iv 617 . 8 ( 316 -293 )); at Ps.-Skylax 64 , Müller ( GGM i ) prints Κίερον (an emendation from ιasperερόν ); Strabo 9 . 5 . 14 has Κίερος ; I.Thessalie 15 . 2 (C2e) has Κιάριον . Tradition claims that before the arrival of the Thessalians the city was called Αacuteρνη (Steph.Byz. 123 . 22 ). The city-ethnic is Κιεριευacuteς (Head, HN ² 292 -93 ( c. 400 -344 )), or Κιάριος ( I.Thessalie 14 (C3 -C2 )). In Ps.-Skylax 64 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Kierion is one of nine toponyms listed between the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πόλεις Θετταλῶν ; it is also called a polis in, e.g., I.Thessalie 15 . 13 (C2e). [ ∆α ] µ όσιον is found in IG ix . 2 269 (C4 ?). The internal and collective use of the city-ethnic is found on coins (Head, HN ² 292 -93 (C4 )). In C3s a citizen of Kierion served as Delphic theorodokos ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 26 ( 230 -220 )). According to Ps.-Skylax 64 , Kierion was situated in Thessalia, and according to Strabo 9 . 5 . 14 , it belonged to the tetras of Thessaliotis (Helly ( 1995 ) 165 ). Because the city lay in very flat and open land, its boundaries are not clearly defined. At Kierion are remains of a circuit wall, the earliest phases of which go back to the Classical or perhaps the Archaic period. On the acropolis a Heltic kastro is visible, but earlier activity there cannot be excluded. Otherwise, practically nothing is known about the lower town, which was probably situated on the eastern side of the hill (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 130 -32 ; autopsy by J.-C. Decourt). Kierion struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard from c. 400 . Denominations: didrachms, triobols, trihemiobols, obols and hemiobols. Types: obv . head of Zeus, or Arne, or Poseidon, or Apollo, or horse feeding or galloping; rev . youthful male god (Asklepios?) seated on a throne or rock, or nymph Arne kneeling, or head of Arne, or naked hero warrior fighting; legend: ΚΙ , ΚΙΕ , ΚΙΕΡΙΕ , ΚΙΕΡΙΑΙΟΝ , ΚΙΕΡΙΕΙΩΝ .

Type: C (classified as a fort/tower by Barr ., but see infra ). A toponym is not attested,but * Κονδαία may be assumed (cf. infra Mondaia);it has been proposed to emend MS Κονιαῖος at Hdt. 5 . 63 . 3 to Κονδαῖος (cf. Helly ( 1995 ) 103 ), but the city-ethnic found in Heltic sources is Κονδαιευacuteς ( Gonnoi ii no. 3 . 3 (C3f)). The location is uncertain, but the community should probably be located at the ancient site at Orthe Magoula, near the modern village of Phalanni Larisis (Helly ( 1999 )); Barr . locates it at Bakrina. Both locations put it in the tetras of Pelasgiotis. At 5 . 63 . 3 Herodotos states that the Θεσσαλοιgrave . . . απέπε µ ψαν κοινηsubiotaηtilde γνώ µ ηsubiotaη χρεώ µ ενοι χιλίην τε ιasperacuteππον καιgrave τοgraveν βασιλέα σφέτερον Κινέην άνδρα Κονιαῖον to support the Peisistratidai of Athens. Κονιαῖος is most probably a corruption of a Thessalian city-ethnic, and it has been proposed to restore Κονδαῖος , to be interpreted as the cityethnic of Kondaia (Helly ( 1995 ) 103 ). Since there is no other evidence for the political status of Kondaia in the Archaic (or Classical) period, the inclusion of Kondaia in this Inventory depends upon acceptance of this emendation, which would provide an attestation of the external individual use of the city-ethnic; such a usage is often indicative that the site to whose toponym the ethnic is related was a polis (Hansen ( 1996 ) 182 -87 ). In C3 Kondaia was undoubtedly a polis : Gonnoi ii no. 3 is a C3f grant of proxeny by Gonnoi to Χέναρχος ' Ιπ [ πάρχου ] Κονδαιευacuteς . At the site identified with Kondaia ( supra ) ancient architectural elements have been found, as well as a temple foundation (Helly ( 1977 ))."

The cityethnic is Κραν ( ν ) ουacuteνιος (Head, HN ² 293 -94 (C5 -C4 ); SEG 23 421 (C4 )), Κραννώνιος (Hdt. 6 . 127 ; Head, HN ² 293 -94 ), or Κρανώνιος (Diog. Laert. 2 . 25 ). Tradition claims that before the arrival of the Thessalians the city was called ' Εφυacuteρη or ' Εφυacuteρα (Kineas ( FGrHist 603 ) fr. 1 ) or /acuteΕφυροι (Apollodoros ( FGrHist 224 ) fr. 179 ). Krannon is listed as a polis in the political sense at Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 ; in Ps.-Skylax 64 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Krannon is one of nine toponyms listed between the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πόλεις Θετταλῶν . Cf. also [Arist.] Mir. ausc . 842 b 10 and Diod. 15 . 61 . 5 (r 369 ); πολῖται is found in Polyaen. 2 . 34 (possibly rC4 ) (cf. RE xi. 1583 ); and at Hdt. 6 . 126 , 127 , πάτρη is used about Krannon.The earliest epigraphical reference to a πόλις Κραννουνίουν is in a C3s honorific decree ( IG ix . 2 458 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins (Head, HN ² 293 -94 (C5 -C4 )) and in the decree IG ix . 2 458 (C3s); externally it is attested in Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 3 . 3 ; and CID ii 7 B. 2 ( c. 357 ). The external and individual use is found, e.g., at Hdt. 6 . 127 . 4 , in SEG 23 421 (C4 ) and in CID ii 24 . i . 14 ( c. 336 -323 ). Krannon is implicitly described as patre ( = patris ) in Hdt. 6 . 127 . 1 -4 . Krannon was situated in Thessalia (Hdt. 6 . 127 . 4 ; Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 ), and more precisely in the tetras of Pelasgiotis (Simon. 127 , Page; Hecat.fr. 133 ; cf. Helly ( 1995 ) 166 ). The territory is called πεδίον Κραννώνιον in Callim. Hymn 4 . 138 . Tothe north,it was bounded by the territory of Larisa,to the west by that of Atrax, to the east by that of Skotoussa, while to the south the crest line of the Revenia hills separated it from the Enipeus valley (Decourt ( 1990 ) fig. 27 ). In C6 the most prominent family in the political life of the city was the Skopadai ( RE iiiA. 567 -69 ; Helly ( 1995 ) 107 -12 ). Cavalry and an anonymous cavalry commander are attested in Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 , when Krannon was allied with Athens alongside other Thessalian cities. Xen. Hell . 4 . 3 . 3 mentions Krannon among the allies of the Boiotians, again alongside other Thessalian cities.If the story about Deinias in Polyaen. 2 . 34 refers to C4 (cf. RE xi. 1583 ; Berve ( 1967 ) 294 -95 ), the city experienced a tyranny in this period. (The same source refers to Krannonian farming out of ηasper φυλακηgrave τηtildeς πόλεως and ηasper τουtilde σίτου δεκάτη .) In 369 , Krannon joined Alexander II of Makedon, who had been called in by the Aleuadai of Larisa in their struggle against Alexander of Pherai, and the city was presumably garrisoned by the Makedonian king (Diod. 15 . 61 . 5 ); the garrison was probably removed, as was a similar one at Larisa, when Pelopidas arrived at the head of a Boiotian army later in the year (Diod. 15 . 67 . 4 ). SEG 23 421 is probably a C4 grant of proxenia by Pherai to two citizens of Krannon.Krauxidas of Krannon was victorious in the horse-race at Olympia in 648 (Paus. 5 . 8 . 8 ; Olympionikai 53 ). At an unknown date Krannon became a walled and fortified city, but almost nothing is known about the acropolis and the urban centre, except for a possible temple of Athena Polias on the acropolis (Arvanitopoulos ( 1922 -24 )). The main cults of the Krannonians seem to be those of Athena ( IG ix . 2 460 (C2 ); cf. Arvanitopoulos ( 1922 -24 ) 37 ), Asklepios ( ArchDelt 43 B: 280 (C3 ); IG ix . 2 461 (C2 )) and Apollo (Prournios: Habicht ( 1981 ) ( c. 200 ); T empeitas: Prakt ( 1915 ) 17 (C3 ?)). Other cults: Ennodia ( LIMC ii 882 (C4s)), Poseidon (Head, HN ² 293 -94 (C4 )) and Zeus (Megas: ArchDelt 43 B: 280 (C3 ?); Notios: ArchDelt 16 B: 182 (C4 )). Krannon struck silver coins in C5 and bronze coins in C4 . ( 1 ) Silver, 480 -400 . Denominations: drachms, tetrobols, triobols, obols and hemiobols on the Aiginetan standard.

Meno 70 B, polis is used in the urban sense, and in Ps.-Skylax 64 , where polis is again used in the urban sense, Λάρισσα is the second toponym listed between the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πόλεις Θετταλῶν . Polites is found in Pl. Meno 70 B; akropolis is found in Antiochos ( FGrHist 29 ) fr. 2 ; asty is found in Theophr. Caus.pl . 5 . 14 . 3 ; and Γaltαστικά appears as epiklesis of the goddess Enodia in IG ix . 2 574 of 450 -425 ; patris is found in SEG 31 585 (C4 ) (cf. CEG ii 639 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C5f coins ( infra ); the external collective use is found in Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 3 . 3 ; CID ii 68 . ii . 14 ( 338 -330 ); Tod 196 . 8 ( 330 -324 ); and the external individual use in Hdt. 9 . 1 , 9 . 58 . 1 ; CID ii 4 . i . 44 ( 360 ); SEG 26 327 ( c. 350 ); IG vii 414 . 14 (C4m-s); IG ii² 353 . 11 ( 329 / 8 ). Larisa was a Thessalian community ( F.Delphes iii . 4 378 ( 342 / 1 )) and belonged to the tetras of Pelasgiotis (schol. Ap. Rhod. 1 . 40 ). The name of the territory was ηasper Λαρισσαία (Theopomp.fr. 34 ; on this fragment, see Martin ( 1982 )); it is termed χώρα in Theophr. Caus. pl . 5 . 14 . 2 . Theopomp. fr. 34 mentions a site called Χαλκαί in the territory; it is probably to be located at Nikaia Larisis, a site with Classical material (D. Kontogiannis ( 1992 ) 386 ). Apollo Leschaios was worshipped in the territory ( IG ix . 2 1027 (C5l)). On the territory, see further Helly ( 1984 ). The resemblance of the C5 coinage of the Perrhaibians (see entry for Oloosson) to that of Larisa (see infra ) has been taken to indicate that Larisa may have brought the Perrhaibians into dependence upon itself (Martin ( 1985 ) 72 -73 ). Early in the Peloponnesian War,Larisaian cavalry assisted the Athenians (Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 ) alongside other Thessalian poleis which were allied to Athens. In the 390 s, Larisa, alongside other Thessalian poleis , was allied to Boiotia (Xen. Hell . 4 . 3 . 3 ). In 404 , forces from Larisa and other unspecified Thessalian polities were defeated by Lykophron I of Pherai, who struggled for pan-Thessalian hegemony (Xen. Hell . 2 . 3 . 4 ). The conflict continued into the 390 s, when, during the Corinthian War,Medeios of Larisa was supported by the anti-Spartan alliance (Diod. 14 . 82 . 5 (r 395 )) and captured Pharsalos. In 369 , the Aleuadai of Larisa called in the Makedonian king Alexander II to support them in their struggle with Alexander of Pherai; the king, however, took the city by force and placed a garrison on the acropolis (Diod. 15 . 61 . 3 -5 ), a garrison which was withdrawn at the arrival of Theban troops under Pelopidas (Diod. 15 . 67 . 4 (r 369 / 8 )). In 357 / 6 , the Aleuadai again called upon the king of Makedon, Philip II, who responded favourably and thus started his interference in Greek politics (Diod. 16 . 14 . 2 ). During the crisis of 330 -324 , Larisa received 50 , 000 medimnoi of grain from Kyrene (Tod 196 . 8 ). A man from Larisa is listed in an Athenian catalogue of mercenaries ( IG ii² 1156 . i . 61 -63 ( c. 300 )). A refugee is attested in 399 by Arist. Pol . 1311 b 17 ; as tagos of Thessalia,Polyphron II of Pherai ( 370 / 69 ) had many citizens of Larisa sent into exile (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 34 ). Reception of envoys, sent by Agesilaos of Sparta during his march home from Asia Minor in 394 , is recorded in Plut. Ages . 16 ; the Larisaians, allied to Sparta's enemies, arrested these envoys, who were released only after a truce had been negotiated. Citizens of Larisa were appointed proxenoi by Delphi in 342 / 1 ( F.Delphes iii . 4 378 ) and 333 / 2 ( F.Delphes iii . 1 401 ), by Lamia in C4l ( IG ix . 2 60 ), and by Gonnoi in C4l/C3e ( Gonnoi ii 1 ); but note that Aristonous of Larisa (for whom see Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 ) was, presumably, appointed proxenos by Athens c. 430 ( IG i³ 55 with Walbank ( 1978 ) 158 -66 ) and that IG ii² 39 . 13 ( 379 / 8 ) has been restored [ Λαρ ] ισαί [ οις ], which, if accepted, is an Athenian grant of proxeny to four citizens of Larisa. A mass grant of citizenship by Larisa seems to be implied by Arist. Pol . 1275 b 29 ff (Helly ( 1984 ) 229 ). Residence of free non-citizens is implied by Pl. Meno 70 B. Grants of citizenship to citizens of Larisa are attested by F.Delphes iii . 4 378 ( 342 / 1 ); IG ii² 558 ( c. 303 / 2 ), and IG ix . 2 60 (C4l) (Lamia). IG iv² . 1 94 b. 5 ( 360 -359 ) lists a citizen of Larisa as theorodokos of Epidauros. A monetary donation by Larisa to ' theoroi sent out from Argos to announce the celebration of the Nemean Games and the Heraia'is recorded by IG iv 617 . 6 ( 316 -293 ); Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 -75 , 127 -29 . According to Arist. Pol . 1305 b 22 -30 and 1306 a 20 -30 , Larisa was an oligarchy; the most powerful family was that of the Aleuadai ( RE i. 2 . 1372 -74 ; Helly ( 1995 ) 112 -24 ), who domi- nated Larisaian, and Thessalian, politics for long periods. A board of demiourgoi is implied by Arist. Pol . 1275 b 29 ; politophylakes are mentioned at Pol . 1305 b 29 : they were elected by the assembly (ibid.). An άρχων µ εσίδιος in, possibly, C4m (cf. Dem. 18 . 48 ; but see Martin ( 1985 ) 255 -60 ) is mentioned at Pol . 1306 a 28 -30 . A stasis is attested for C5l (Xen. An . 1 . 1 . 10 ; RE xii. 850 ); one faction in this stasis may have sought the support of Archelaos of Makedon: Thrasymachos fr. 2 , DK, obviously suggests Makedonian interference at Larisa (Westlake ( 1935 ) 51 ff; Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 140 -41 ; Martin ( 1985 ) 89 ). Further outbreaks of stasis are attested in 370 / 69 (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 34 ) and c. 344 / 3 (Arist. Pol . 1306 a 26 -30 ; Callim. fr. 588 , Pfeiffer; cf. Gehrke, Stasis 189 -97 ). At Pol . 1331 a 30 ff, Aristotle describes as Thessalian the institution of the eleuthera agora : that is, an agora from which artisans and traders were banned and to which they could have access only if invited by the magistrates. An eleuthera agora may have been identified at Larisa, south of the acropolis (Tziaphalias ( 1994 b ) 158 -59 , 169 -70 , 173 -74 , cf. plan 155 ). A 'commercial agora'was probably located to the west on the bank of the river Peneios (Tziaphalias ( 1994 b ) 159 , plan 155 ). A C4 amphora stamp ( ΘΑΣΙΩΝ ) indicates trade ( SEG 35 635 ). A temple of Athena on the acropolis is mentioned by Antiochos ( FGrHist 29 ) fr. 2 ; in it was the grave of the mythical founder of the city, Akrisios (cf. schol. Ap. Rhod. 1 . 40 ; Paus. 2 . 16 . 2 ); on the acropolis are traces of a Classical road and remains of buildings constructed in mudbrick (Tziaphalias ( 1994 b ) 157 -58 ); there are no remains of a separate fortification of the acropolis, but at 15 . 61 . 4 (r 369 / 8 ) Diodorus mentions a siege of the acropolis which suggests that it was fortified. The teichos is mentioned by Diod. 15 . 61 . 4 (r 369 ). The undated circuit wall runs for some 4 , 000 m, but is not known for its entire course, and accordingly the area enclosed by it cannot be estimated. The wall is constructed in mudbrick on a stone socle (Tziaphalias ( 1994 b ) 177 -78 , plan 155 ). Since the ancient city is overlaid by the modern, not many remains are visible, and it cannot be ascertained whether it was built on a grid plan (ibid. 158 ). In the city are remains of what was probably a C4 Doric temple of Apollo Kerdoios; here public documents were displayed (ibid. 169 -70 ). The cemeteries span the period from C5 onwards (ibid. 177 -78 ). Attested cults include those of Athena Polias ( IG ix . 2 592 (C3 ), but cf. Antiochos ( FGrHist 29 ) fr. 2 ), Apollo Leschaios ( supra ), Dionysos Karpios ( SEG 35 590 ( 450 -425 )), Enodia Wastika ( IG ix . 2 575 ( 450 -425 )), Gaia ( SEG 29 533 (C4 )), Herakles ( IG ix . 2 580 (C4 )), Poseidon Patroios ( SEG 35 647 , 650 (both c. 300 )), and Zeus Thaulios ( SEG 35 613 ( c. 300 )). Three citizens of Larisa achieved Olympic victories: Echekratidas in 464 ( Olympionikai 258 ), Lykos in 452 ( Olympionikai 281 ) and Krokinas in 404 and 396 ( Olympionikai 351 , 367 a). In 366 -338 , Epikrates of Larisa won the pentathlon for ageneioi at the Amphiaraia at Oropos ( IG vii 414 . 14 ); Lykormas was victorious at the Pythian Games in 310 (Paus. 10 . 7 . 8 ). Several citizens of Larisa served the Amphiktyonic League as naopoioi ( CID ii 10 A. i . 7 ( 357 / 6 ); 31 . 73 , 96 ( 345 / 4 ); 32 . 3 ( 341 / 40 ), etc.). After the Third Sacred War, the Larisaians rented one of the houses confiscated from exiled pro-Phokian Delphians ( CID ii 68 . i . 13 and ii . 14 ( 338 -330 )). Larisa was the first Thessalian polity to strike coins. The earliest silver issues of drachms, triobols, trihemiobols and obols antedate the Persian War and are on the Persian standard (Lavva ( 2001 ) 42 ). Types: obv . horse biting its foreleg, or head of Jason, or head of nymph, or bull's head, or horseman with two spears; rev . sandal of Jason (sometimes with double axe above) in incuse square,or horse's head in incuse square, or bearded male figure seated in incuse square; legends: ΛΑ , ΛΑΡΙ , ΛΑΡΙΣΑ , ΛΑΡΙΣΑΙΟΝ , ΛΑΡΙΣΑΕΟΝ (Head, HN ² 298 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 1 nos. 1410 -16 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) 115 ; SNG Cop. Thessaly 89 -92 ; Martin ( 1985 ) 34 -35 ). Immediately after the Persian War the city switched to the Aiginetan standard and initially used the same types and even the same dies (cf. SNG Cop. Thessaly on no. 89 ). From this point onwards until its issues ceased c. 320 (Martin ( 1985 ) 52 , 163 ), Larisa was the most important mint of Thessalia and struck didrachms, drachms, triobols, diobols, trihemiobols,obols and hemiobols. Obv . types depict youth restraining bull, horseman, horse (C5 ); head of nymph Larisa,or running bull (C4 ), etc.; rev . types depict free horse, seated nymph Larisa, or Asklepios (C5 , in incuse square); and galloping horse or galloping horseman, etc.; legends: ΛΑ , ΛΑΡΙ , ΛΑΡΙΣΑ , ΛΑΡΙΣΑΙ , ΛΑΡΙΣΑΙΑ , ΛΑΡΙΣΑΙΟΝ , ΛΑΡΙΣΑΙΩΝ . Some coins of c. 370 -360 carry on the rev . the inscription ΣΙΜΟΣ in tiny script, but the significance of the inscription is unclear (Martin ( 1985 ) 103 ; cf. Martin ( 1983 ) 13 -16 ); another C4 issue has obv . male head + ΑΛΕΥΑ (i.e. presumably a depiction of Aleuas the Red); rev . eagle on fulmen + ΕΛΛΑ and ΛΑΡΙΣΑΙΑ ; the message intended is disputed,see Helly ( 1995 ) 119 -20 (Head, HN ² 298 -99 ; SNG Cop. Thessaly 93 -135 ; Hermann ( 1924 -25 ); Martin ( 1983 )). For similarities between the C5 coins with obv . youth restraining bull; rev . horse, and con- temporary coins of Krannon, the Perrhaibians, Pharkadon, Trikka, Pherai and Skotoussa, see Kraay ( 1976 ) 115 -16 and Martin ( 1985 ) 36 -37 . The bronze issues of Larisa began c. 400 : obv . head of fountain nymph Larisa; rev . horse trotting or feeding, or horseman with petasos and lance, or head of Asklepios, bearded and laureate; various letters, symbols and monograms; legends: ΛΑΡΙΣΑ , ΛΑΡΙΣΑΙ ΛΑΡΙΣΑΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 297 -99 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 1 nos. 1009 -18 , ii. 4 nos. 367 -410 ; SNG Cop. Thessaly 136 -46 , Suppl . 245 -47 ; Rogers ( 1932 ) 93 -100 ; Liampi ( 1996 ) 101 -5 , 110 -11 )."
402,Methylion (Methylieus),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,,,359,1888,"402 . Methylion (Methylieus) Map 55 . Unlocated, but see infra . Type: B. The toponym is Μεθυacuteλιον , τό ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 29 ( 230 -220 )). The city-ethnic is Μεθυλιευacuteς (C5 -C4 coins ( infra )). NoArchaic or Classical source calls Methylion a polis , but it merits inclusion in this Inventory because ( 1 ) it minted coins in C5 -C4 ( infra ); ( 2 ) a man of Methylion served as Delphic theorodokos in 230 -220 ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 29 ); ( 3 ) some C3 tiles are stamped with the collective city-ethnic ( infra ); cf. also Biesantz ( 1965 ) 140 n. 235 for an-undatedinscription: Μεθυλιέων δη µ όσιον (C5 ?). The only Classical source attesting to the existence and status of Methylion is its C5 -C4m coinage. Methylion was situated in Thessalia (Steph. Byz. 440 . 16 s.v. Μεθυδρίον , where the passage καιgrave εasperτέρα πόλις Θεσσαλίας , ωasperς Φίλων possibly refers to Methylion), more precisely in Thessaliotis (Heyman ( 1970 ); Helly ( 1995 ) 165 , 229 -30 ). It is probably to be located at the village of Myrina near Prodomos Karditsis, whence come C3 tiles stamped Μεθυλιέων (information kindly provided by C. Indzesiloglou). A cult of Athena is presumably indicated by the coin types depicting this goddess (Heyman ( 1970 ) nos. 6 -7 ). Methylion struck coins in silver and bronze in C4 ; a drachm on the Aiginetan standard is presumably C5 . It shows obv . forepart of horse; rev . grain ( ΜΕΘΥ ); for similarities between this coin and coins of Skotoussa and coins struck in the name of'the Thessalians'(possibly by Pherai), see Kraay ( 1976 ) 116 and Martin ( 1985 ) 37 -38 . C4 obols: obv . male head,or Nike; rev . female head,or a warrior,or Athena; legend: ΜΕΘΥ , ΜΕΘΥΛΙΕΩΝ . Bronzes: obv . young male head, or head of nymph; rev . Nike, or horseman with spear; legend: ΜΕΘΥΛΙΕΩΝ (Head, HN ² 301 -2 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 4 nos. 505 -7 ; Heyman ( 1970 ))."
403,Metropolis (Matropolitas),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.2,21.5,762,3809,"403 . Metropolis (Matropolitas) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 20 , long. 21 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Ματρόπολις , ηasper ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 30 ( 230 -220 )); the city-ethnic is Ματροπολίτας ( CID ii 5 . ii . 32 ( 358 )) or Μητροπολίτης (C4f coins, infra ). Metropolis is listed as a polis in the political sense under the heading ταίδε ταtilde µ πολίων ήνικαν in CID ii 5 . ii . 25 -26 , 32 -33 ( 358 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4f coins ( infra ) and the external collective use in CID ii 5 . ii . 32 -33 ( 358 ). According to Strabo 9 . 5 . 17 , Metropolis was founded by a synoecism ( συνΩsubiotaώκιστο ) of τριῶν . . . πολιχνίων ασή µ ων . The terminus ante quem for this synoecism is 358 , the year in which the city is mentioned in the naopic accounts in Delphi ( CID ii 5 . ii . 32 -33 ; Diod. 15 . 30 . 5 (r 377 ) does not refer to Thessalian Metropolis; cf. Stylianou ( 1998 ) 280 ). The circular fortifications,running for 5 km,are located in the plain and encompass an isolated hill; the masonry style of the circuit (isodomic with moat) points to a date in C4f for its construction (C.Indzesiloglou,pers.comm.).The earliest coins of the city are likewise dated to C4f ( infra ). Among the communities originally participating in the synoecism were Onthyrion (Strabo 9 . 5 . 17 ) and probably Polichnai (cf. Helly in BCH 94 ( 1970 ) 187 ), but the city expanded after the foundation (Strabo 9 . 5 . 17 : υasperacuteστερον δεgrave καιgrave πλείους προσελήφθησαν ). Remains are reported in ArchDelt 35 ([ 1980 ] 1988 ) Chron . 268 -69 and 36 ( 1981 ) Chron . 254 ; BCH 113 ( 1989 ) Chron . 637 and fig. 116 . Metropolis was a Thessalian community ( CID ii 5 . ii . 32 -33 ) situated in Hestiaiotis (Strabo 9 . 5 . 17 ). To the north the neighbours were Ithome, which was eventually absorbed by Metropolis (Strabo 9 . 5 . 17 ), Gomphoi and Pelinna; to the east were Methylion and Kieron; to the south was Onthyrion, which was also absorbed by Metropolis ( supra ); to the west was the Pindos range. The entry Ματροπολῖται Θεσσαλοί in CID ii 5 . ii . 32 -33 ( 358 ) presumably indicates membership of the Thessalian Confederacy. A grant of C3l proxeny, etc. to a citizen of Krannon is published by Habicht in Klio 52 ( 1970 ) 143 ; the inscription also testifies to a system of phylai and boards of magistrates. A cult of Aphrodite, the patron divinity, is attested by coins (no. ( 1 ) infra ) and Strabo 9 . 5 . 17 (citing Callim. fr. 200 a, Pfeiffer); public documents were displayed at the temple of Aphrodite (cf. PECS 576 ); Apollo is likewise attested by coins, and a C6s suburban temple dedicated to Apollo Hekatombios has been excavated by C. Indzesiloglou. A collective donation of 120 dr. towards the rebuilding of the temple at Delphi is recorded in CID ii 5 . ii . 32 -33 ( 358 ); IG iv 617 . 9 ( 316 -293 ) has been restored Μα [ τροπολῖται ] (Foucard, accepted by Perlman ( 2000 ) 75 ); the inscription records monetary donations by Thessalian cities 'to the θεωροί sent out from Argos to announce the celebration of the Nemean Games and the Heraia' ( IG iv 617 . 10 (C4l); cf. Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 , 127 -29 ). Cf. CID ii 100 . ii . 5 ff ( 325 ), presumably another collective donation towards the rebuilding of the temple at Delphi. Metropolis struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard c. 400 -c. 344 . ( 1 ) Diobol: obv . head of Aphrodite facing, bird to the right, Nike crowning her; rev . standing Dionysos; legend: ΜΗΤΡΟΠΟ [ ΛΙΤΩΝ ]. ( 2 ) Trihemiobol: obv . as ( 1 ), rev . Apollo Kitharoidos; legend: ΜΗΤΡΟΠΟΛΙΤΩΝ . ( 3 ) Obol: obv . bearded head facing; rev . figure (Aphrodite?) holding thyrsos and seated on rock under tree; legend: ΜΗΤΡΟΠΟΛ (Head, HN ² 302 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 4 520 -22 ; Martin ( 1985 ) 39 )."
404,Mopsion (Mopseus),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.5,22.25,309,1491,"404 . Mopsion (Mopseus) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 50 , long. 22 . 25 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: B. The toponym, Μόψιον , τό is attested only in post-Classical sources (Strabo 9 . 5 . 22 ; Steph. Byz. 480 . 11 ). The city-ethnic is Μοψευacuteς (C4f coins, infra ; Horos 10 -12 ( 1992 -98 ) 356 l. 2 (C3m)) or Μοψε ( ι ) άτας (C4f coins, infra ; Horos 10 -12 ( 1992 -98 ) 356 l. 14 ). No Archaic or Classical source calls Mopsion a polis ; it is included as a probable polis here on account of its C4f coinage ( infra ). The community refers to itself as a polis in the political sense in Horos 10 -12 ( 1992 -98 ) 356 l. 2 , a C3m grant of politeia and other privileges to three men of Atrax (cf. IG ix . 2 1056 (C3 )). The internal collective use of the cityethnic is found on C4f bronze coins ( infra ); the external individual use of the city-ethnic is found in IG ix . 2 521 . 21 (C2m). Mopsion was a Thessalian community in the tetras of Pelasgiotis (Steph. Byz. 480 . 11 ), situated 0 . 5 km inside the pass of Rhodia (Helly ( 1999 ) 102 -3 ). Archaeological investigations of the site remain unpublished. Mopsion struck bronze coins in C4f. Types: obv . head of Zeus facing with fulmen to the right; rev . Lapith fighting centaur; legend: ΜΟΨΕΙΩΝ or ΜΟΨΕΑΤΩΝ ; or obv . draped female bust r.; rev . standing Aphrodite with dove in hand; legend: ΜΟΨΕΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 302 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 4 no. 744 a; Rogers ( 1932 ) nos. 412 -13 ). The coin types point to cults of Zeus and Aphrodite."
405,Orthos (Orthieus),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.15,22.0,275,1404,"405 . Orthos (Orthieus) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 15 , long. 22 . 00 . Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is /acuteΟρθος or /acuteΟρθοι or /acuteΟρθα ; the genitive /acuteΟρθου is found in CID ii 12 . i . 68 (C4m); and the forms εν /acuteΟρθαι and εν /acuteΟρθοις are both found in the Delphic catalogue of theorodokoi of c. 230 -220 ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 27 , iv . 25 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ορθιευacuteς (coins, infra ). No Archaic or Classical source calls Orthos a polis , but it deserves inclusion in this Inventory as a probable polis on account of its late Classical bronze coinage ( infra ). In addition, CID ii 12 . i . 68 records a contribution by a man described as Θεσσαλοgraveς εξ /acuteΟρθου (C4m). The site of Orthos-not to be confused with the Homeric Orthe, the probable ancestor of Phalanna-lay north-east of the village of Kedros (Helly ( 1992 ) 78 ) and so in the tetras of Thessaliotis. However, there is no published material on this site. A cult of Athena may be assumed on the basis of the coin types (see infra ), and outside the walls is a sanctuary of Demeter (C. Indzesiloglou, pers. comm.). Orthos struck bronze coins c. 350 / 340 -200 . Obv . Athena; rev . springing horse in wreath of olive, or trident in wreath of olive; legend: ΟΡΘΙ or ΟΡΘΙΕΩΝ , ΟΡΘΙΕΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 303 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 4 nos. 595 -96 ; Rogers ( 1932 ) nos. 421 -25 ; SNG Cop.Thessaly 183 -84 )."
406,Oxynion,Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,,,205,1058,"406 . Oxynion Map 55 . Unlocated. Type: C. The toponym is ' Οξυacuteνιο [ ν ] ( IG iv² . 1 94 .b. 1 ( 359 )) or ' Οξυacuteνεια , ηasper (Strabo 7 . 7 . 9 ). A city-ethnic is not attested. No Archaic or Classical source calls Oxynion a polis , though Strabo 7 . 7 . 9 does. The reason for including it in this Inventory is the attestation in 359 of an Epidaurian theorodokos ( IG iv² 1 . 94 .b. 1 ); note, however,that Perlman ( 2000 ) E. 1 fr.b. 1 prints Πέλιν [ να ], not ' Οξυacuteνιον as IG . Nothing further is known about the city. Oxynion has traditionally been located at Meritsa (modern Oxyneia) north-west of Kalambaka, but this location does not fit the indications provided by Strabo 7 . 7 . 9 that it was 120 stades from Azoros. The same applies to the site at Nea-Smolia (Darmezin ( 1992 )). A site near Dasochori may fit: a hill on the left bank of the river Paliomandano at Paliogourtsia, with some architectural remains on the surface and ceramics covering C4 to Roman times; however, epigraphical confirmation is lacking (Darmezin ( 1994 ))."
407,Pagasai (Pagasitas),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.2,22.55,791,3868,"407 . Pagasai (Pagasitas) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 20 , long. 22 . 55 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Παγασαί , αιasper (Hdt. 7 . 193 . 2 ; Dem. 1 . 9 ; Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 56 ). The city-ethnic is Παγασίτας ( CID ii 100 . ii . 8 ( 325 )) or Παγασαῖος ( IG iv 617 . 4 ( 316 -293 )). In Ps.-Skylax 64 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Pagasai is one of nine toponyms listed between the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πόλεις Θετταλῶν . Theopomp. fr. 53 described it as the epineion of Pherai (cf. Plut. Them . 20 . 1 ). The external collective use of the city-ethnic is found in IG iv 617 . 4 ( 316 -293 ), and the external individual use in CID ii 100 . ii . 8 ( 325 ). Theopompos' description of Pagasai as the epineion of Pherai ( FGrHist 115 fr. 53 ) does not mean that it cannot have been a polis (Hansen ( 1997 ) 36 -37 ); the exact relationship between the two cities is unknown,but Pagasai may possibly have been a dependent polis of Pherai serving as its harbour (cf. ibid. for parallels); or Theopompos'statement may simply mean that the city was within the general sphere of Pheraian influence (a brother of Jason resided there: Polyaen. 6 . 1 . 6 ). Ps.-Skylax 64 describes Pagasai as Thessalian (cf. CID ii 100 . i . 20 , ii . 8 ), and Theopompos' description of it as επίνειον Φεραίων puts it in Pelasgiotis ( FGrHist 115 fr. 53 ). Dem. 1 . 12 , 22 , 2 . 11 (cf. Ath. 43 A; Polyaen. 6 . 2 . 1 ) distinguishes between Pagasai and Magnesia, so Pagasai was accordingly not Magnesian;but in 353 the city was taken by Philip II (presumably after a siege: Dem. 1 . 9 ) and forced into submission ( ηνάγκασεν υasperποταγηtildeναι , Diod. 16 . 31 . 6 ; cf. Dem. 1 . 22 , 2 . 11 ). Presumably from then on it was regarded as Magnesian and may have been handed over to the Magnesians by Philip ( RE xviii. 2308 ), though according to schol. Dem. 1 . 22 the incomes from the harbours and the agora were given to Philip himself; Philip probably installed a garrison at Pagasai (Martin ( 1985 ) 97 ). Hes. Scut . 70 mentions a bomos of Apollo Pagasaios, and a C5 -C4 temple of Apollo and a stoa have been found outside the circuit on the saddle south of the acropolis (Milojcic ( 1974 )). The rocky summit of the hill of Soros, the acropolis of Pagasai, was crowned by a presumably C6l-C5e circular wall, and the lower city was surrounded by a contemporary triple wall ( Prakt ( 1909 ) 165 -70 ) which enclosed an area of c. 6 -7 ha. For a plan, see Marzolff ( 1994 b ) 256 fig. 1 . The earliest indications of occupation are late Archaic, and there are no Heltic sherds either in the city proper or in the extramural sanctuary, or in the graves (Triantaphyllopoulou ( 2000 ) 60 ), a fact which fits the report of its relocation to Demetrias in 293 (Strabo 9 . 5 . 15 ). The central social and economic feature of Pagasai was, it seems,its harbour.In 477 / 6 a Delian League fleet wintered at the harbour (Plut. Them . 20 . 1 ), and Pagasai was a trading port exporting grain (Xen. Hell . 5 . 4 . 56 ), meat (Plut. Mor . 193 DE) and slaves (Ar. Plut . 521 ; Hermippos fr. 63 . 19 ( PCG )). The cult of Apollo Pagasaios is frequently mentioned ( RE xviii. 2 . 2303 ). A cult of Poseidon is attested by a C5f dedication ( ArchEph ( 1932 ) 27 no. 12 ), and a cult of Artemis may be inferred from IG ix . 2 1123 (C3e); a cult of Dionysos Pelagios is attested in Theopomp. fr. 352 , and Alexander of Pherai may possibly have been worshipped as a hero at Pagasai ( RE xviii. 2307 ). IG iv 617 . 4 ( 316 -293 ) records a monetary donation by the Pagasaians 'to the θεωροί sent out from Argos to announce the celebration of the Nemean Games and the Heraia' (Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 , 127 -29 ); cf. CID ii 100 . ii . 5 ff ( 325 ), presumably a collective donation towards the rebuilding of the temple at Delphi."
408,Peirasia (Peirasieus),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.3,22.15,329,1591,"408 . Peirasia (Peirasieus) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 30 , long. 22 . 15 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Πειρεσία in Ap. Rhod. 1 . 37 , the earliest attestation, but the city-ethnic regularly uses a stem in ρα for ρε : Πειράσιος (Thuc. 2 . 22 . 2 ), or Πειρασιευacuteς (C4 coins, infra ). Peirasia is listed as a polis in the political sense at Thuc. 2 . 22 . 2 . Similarly, in the Delphic naopoioi 's accounts the Peirasians are recorded in a fragmentary list ( CID ii 8 . ii . 6 ), the heading of which undoubtedly included the formula: ταίδε ταtilde µ πολίων ήνικαν ( CID ii 5 . ii . 25 -26 ) vel sim . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested on C4 coins ( infra ), and the external collective use in Thuc. 2 . 22 . 2 and CID ii 8 . ii . 6 ( c. 360 / 59 ). Peirasia was Thessalian (Steph. Byz. 138 . 17 ; Livy 32 . 13 . 9 ) and most probably belonged to the tetras of Thessaliotis. Cavalry and an unnamed cavalry commander are attested in Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 . A contribution of more than 200 dr. to the naopic board at Delphi is recorded in CID ii 8 . ii . 6 ( c. 360 / 59 ). The fortification of the acropolis and lower town is very badly preserved, difficult to describe and impossible to date (Decourt ( 1990 ) 157 ); the habitation area seems to have been situated to the south-west of the lower city, close to the valley of the Enipeus (autopsy by J.-C. Decourt). Peirasia struck silver trihemiobols on the Aiginetan standard c. 400 -344 . Types: obv . head of Athena; rev . horseman; legend: ΠΕΙΡΑΣΙΕΩΝ (Head, HN ² 303 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 4 no. 519 )."

The toponym is Πελινναῖον , τό (Pind. Pyth . 10 . 4 ; Ps.-Skylax 64 ); Πέλιννα , ηasper is found in Arr. Anab . 1 . 7 . 5 ; Steph. Byz. 515 . 4 . IG iv 617 . 11 ( 316 -293 ) has been restored [ ε ] κκ Πελ [ ί ] νν [ ας ], while Perlman ( 2000 ) E. 1 fr. b 1 prints Πέλιν [ να ] (note, however, that IG iv² . 1 94 / 95 . 1 b. 1 prints this entry as ' Οξυacuteνιον ). The city-ethnic is variously Πελινναιευacuteς ( CID II 31 . 73 ( 345 / 4 )), Πελινναευacuteς (coins c. 300 , infra ), and Πελινναῖος (coins c. 300 , infra ; Diod. 18 . 11 . 1 (r 323 ); Polyaen. 4 . 2 . 19 (r 356 )). In Ps.-Skylax 64 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Pelinna(ion) is the seventh of nine toponyms listed between the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πόλεις Θετταλῶν , and Diod. 18 . 11 . 1 (r 323 ) by implication describes Pelinna(ion) as a polis in the political sense. Strabo 9 . 5 . 17 calls it a phrourion in an achronic reference. The internal collective use of the (abbreviated) city-ethnic is found on C4 coins ( infra ); the external collective use of the city-ethnic is found in Polyaen. 4 . 2 . 19 (r 356 ) and Diod. 18 . 11 . 1 (r 323 ). The external individual use is found repeatedly in CID ii , e.g. 24 . i . 13 ( 336 / 5 ), 31 . 73 ( 345 / 4 ), 32 . 10 ( 340 / 39 ). Pelinna(ion) was a Thessalian city (Ps.-Skylax 64 ); Steph. Byz. 515 . 3 locates it in Phthiotis, but Strabo 9 . 5 . 17 in Hestiaiotis, which is more likely to be correct. It was situated at Palaiogardiki on the left bank of the Peneios, 3 km northeast of Petroporo and 14 km east of Trikala (see, however, infra Pharkadon). The acropolis was separately walled: the wall is a C5 polygonal structure running for 1 , 630 m and has square towers (Stählin ( 1938 ); Tziaphalias ( 1992 ) 124 -31 ). The lower city was enclosed by a C4 wall descending from the northernmost point of the acropolis wall; it runs for 2 , 600 m and encloses an area of 59 ha south of the acropolis (Stählin ( 1938 ) 335 ); it has numerous towers and three gates (Stählin ( 1938 ); Tziaphalias ( 1992 ) 124 -31 ). In the lower city are undated remains of such public constructions as stoas (Stählin ( 1938 )), temples (ibid.; Tziaphalias ( 1992 ) 125 -27 ), cisterns (Tziaphalias ( 1992 ) 125 ), and possibly a theatre (Stählin ( 1938 ) 335 ). Traces of a C4 Hippodamian grid plan are found as well (Tziaphalias ( 1992 ) 126 -27 ). The history of the city is almost unknown, but Polyaen. 4 . 2 . 19 (r 356 ) mentions a war between Pelinna(ion) and Pharsalos (in which both seem to have had allies and in which Philip II of Makedon played a part (Hammond ( 1994 ) 48 )), and according to Diod. 18 . 11 . 1 , Pelinna(ion) was the only Thessalian city that did not join the Hellenic alliance in the Lamian War;so it seems to have favoured Makedonia. IG iv 617 . 11 ( 316 -293 ) records a monetary donation by Pelinna 'to the θεωροί sent out from Argos to announce the celebration of the Nemean Games and the Heraia' (Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 , 127 -29 ). A citizen of Pelinna possibly served as theorodokos for Epidauros in 360 / 59 (Perlman ( 2000 ) E. 1 fr. b 1 , printed as Πέλιν [ να ]; note, however, that IG iv² . 1 94 / 95 . 1 b. 1 prints this entry as ' Οξυacuteνιον ). Citizens of Pelinna(ion) served the Amphiktyonic League in various capacities: αργυρολογέων ( CID ii 24 . i . 13 ( 336 / 5 )); naopoios (ibid. 31 . 73 ( 345 / 4 ), 32 . 10 ( 340 / 39 ); hieromnemon ( ibid . 96 . 3 , 97 . 57 (both 327 / 6 ), 32 . 42 (C4l)). In 498 , Hippokleas of Pelinna(ion) was victorious in the Pythian double stadium race (Pind. Pyth . 10 ); in C6l his father Phrikias was a double Olympionikes ( Olympionikai 150 , 156 ), and Hippokleas himself later likewise became a double Olympionikes ( Olympionikai 175 , 184 ). Coin types indicate a cult of the sibyl Manetho, and ivyshaped gold leaves one of Dionysos (Tziaphalias ( 1992 ) 136 -37 ). Pelinna struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard in C5f. Obols: obv . youth restraining bull, or forepart of bull; rev . horse's head; legend: ΠΕΛ , [ ΠΕ ] ΛΙΝ . Hemiobols: obv . bull's hoof; rev . horse's head; legend: ΠΕΛΙ . In C4 , the city struck in both silver and bronze. ( 1 ) Silver (drachm, triobol, trihemiobols).

Size of territory: ? Type: [A]. The toponym is Φάκιον , τό (Thuc. 4 . 78 . 5 ); cf. Phacium at Livy 32 . 13 . 9 . The city-ethnic is Φακιαστάς (C3 coins, infra ). No Archaic or Classical source calls Phakion a polis , but Phakion seems to be indirectly attested as a polis in the political sense in the Delphic accounts of 337 / 6 ( CID ii 74 ): if the restoration Φ [ ακ ] ι [ ασ ] τάς is accepted in i . 43 (cf. 77 . i . 4 and the index p. 305 ) it follows that a tamias of Phakion is recorded after the heading τοgraveν τα µ ίαν αποπέ µ πειν ταgraveς πόλεις in i . 4 . A citizen of Phakion served as Delphic theorodokos in 230 -220 ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 25 ), and Phakion struck bronze coins in C3 . Types: obv . head of crowned nymph; rev . horseman; legend: ΦΑΚΙΑΣΤΩΝ (Head, HN ² 304 ; Rogers ( 1932 ) 146 nos. 444 -45 )."
411,Phaloria (Phaloriastes),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.5,21.3,502,2590,"411 . Phaloria (Phaloriastes) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 50 , long. 21 . 30 , but see infra . Size of territory: ? Type: C. Steph. Byz. 657 . 1 gives the toponym as Φαλώρη , but cites Rhianos ( FGrHist 265 ) fr. 37 for the form Φαλωρία ; the 230 -220 Delphic list of theorodokoi ( BCH 45 ( 1921 )) has Φαλορία or Φαλορέα (Oulhen) at iii . 35 , but Φαλευρία at v .C. 7 ( BCH ; Oulhen reads Φαλε [..] ίαι ). The city-ethnic is Φαλωριαστάς , attested in inscriptions ( IG ix . 1² 13 . 31 ( 271 / 70 )) and on coins ( infra ). Steph. Byz. suggests Φαλωρευacuteς and Φαλωρείτης , but neither form is attested in any other source. The exact location of Phaloria is unknown, but it must have been situated in Hestiaiotis. Some travellers (e.g. Bursian ( 1862 ) 49 ; Heuzey and Daumet ( 1876 ) 413 ) located it at the site of Skoumbos near Megarchi,south of Kalambaka. At the site are important architectural remains (of walls, a tower, a lower city) and a cemetery; these remains attest to the existence of a city, occupied at least during the Classical period. However, most travellers (e.g. Stählin ( 1924 a ) 124 ; Philippson ( 1950 ) 275 ; Meyer, RE suppl. x s.v.) have identified this site with Pialeia (cf. n. 4 ). Following Philippson ( 1950 ) 305 (who himself followed Stählin ( 1924 a ) 114 ), who seems not to have examined the site), Barr . prefers a location at Meritsa (now Oxynia) where, however, (unpublished) surveys conducted in 1991 -92 by Darmezin, Decourt et al . failed to locate ancient remains.Another possible location is at Nea Koutsouphliani near Malakasi (cf. Hammond ( 1967 ) 260 and 681 ), where quarrying has unfortunately destroyed the ancient site (unpublished survey by Darmezin, Decourt et al .). No Archaic or Classical source calls Phaloria a polis , and the reason for its inclusion in this Inventory is the existence of bronze coins dated to 302 -286 by both Head, HN ² 305 and Rogers ( 1932 ) 149 -50 ; if these coins are correctly dated to C4l, the presumption is that Phaloria possibly existed as a polis prior to their minting, i.e. in C4s. In 271 -270 a Thessalos Phaloriastas was awarded proxeny by the Aitolian koinon ( IG ix . 1² 13 . 31 ), and in 230 -220 a Delphic theorodokos resided in the city. The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested on the rare bronze coins dated to 302 -286 . ( 1 ) Obv . head of Athena; rev . wolf running; legend: ΦΑΛΩΡ . ( 2 ) Obv . head of Apollo; rev . Apollo seated on a rock holding an arrow; legend: ΦΑΛΩΡΙΑΣΤΩΝ (Head, HN ² 305 ; Rogers ( 1932 ) nos. 459 -61 ). The types suggest cults of Athena and Apollo."
412,Pharkadon (Pharkadonios),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.35,22.05,734,3841,"412 . Pharkadon (Pharkadonios) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 35 , long. 22 . 05 , but see infra . Size of territory: 2 (?). Type: B. The toponym is Φαρκαδών ( IG iv² . 1 94 .B. i . 2 ( 359 ); Theopomp. fr. 82 ) or Φαρκηδών (Polyaen. 4 . 2 . 18 (r 356 )). The cityethnic is Φαρκαδόνιος (C5 coins, infra ) or Φαρκαδώνιος (Diod. 18 . 56 . 5 (r 319 )) or Φαρκηδόνιος (Polyaen. 4 . 2 . 18 (r 356 )). No Archaic or Classical source calls Pharkadon a polis , but it deserves inclusion here as a probable polis on account of its C5 -C4 coinage and the fact that in 360 / 59 an Epidaurian theorodokos resided at Pharkadon ( IG iv² . 1 94 .B. i . 2 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C5 coins ( infra ) and externally in Polyaen. 4 . 2 . 18 (r 356 ) and Diod. 18 . 56 . 5 (r 319 ). Pharkadon was a Thessalian city (Polyaen. 4 . 2 . 18 (r 356 )) situated in the tetras of Hestiaiotis (Strabo 9 . 5 . 17 ). It has traditionally been located on a double-peaked hill,Sykia,above the modern village of Klotoko, about 20 km east of Trikkala ( PECS followed by Barr .). However, the find of an inscription referring to τοgrave κοινοgraveν Φαρκαδονίων at Palaiogardiki (Tziaphalias ( 1992 ) 116 -20 ), a site normally identified as Pelinna, may cast some doubt on the identification of Pharkadon with Sykia and serve as a reminder that the ancient topography of this part of Hestiaiotis is still not completely understood. For the site at Palaiogardiki, see supra s.v. Pelinna. At the site of Sykia are remains of Classical and later fortifications enclosing both peaks and a lower city (Kirsten ( 1938 ) with a plan at 1836 ). Polyaen. 4 . 2 . 18 (r 356 ) mentions a poliorkia of Pharkadon by Philip II of Makedon and uses such terms as teichos and pyrgos to describe the fortifications. The account refers to stegai as well, and thus implies the existence of buildings inside the wall; there are, however, no remains of such buildings. In 319 , Pharkadonian exiles were explicitly excluded from the general amnesty decreed by Polyperchon (Diod. 18 . 56 . 5 ; cf. Martin ( 1985 ) 104 ). Nothing further is known about these exiles, but their very existence indicates a defined body of citizens. A C3l inscription refers to τοgrave κοινοgraveν Φαρκαδονίων and a system of phylai (Tziaphalias ( 1992 ) 116 -20 ). Philip's siege and the fact that exiles from Pharkadon were explicitly excluded from Polyperchon's general amnesty of 319 (Diod. 18 . 56 . 5 ) suggest that the city had followed an anti-Makedonian line of policy (Martin ( 1985 ) 194 ; Hammond ( 1994 ) 48 ). The silver coin depicting Athena ( infra ) suggests a cult of Athena. Pharkadon struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard c. 480 -400 , and bronze coins in C4f. ( 1 ) Silver. Denominations: triobols, obols and hemiobols. Triobols: obv . youth restraining forepart of bull; rev . forepart of horse in incuse square; legends: ΦΑΡΚ , ΦΑΡΚΑ∆Ο , ΦΑΡΚΑ∆ΟΝΙ (for similarities between coins with these types and contemporary coins of Krannon, Larisa, the Perrhaibians,Trikka,Pherai and Skotoussa,see Kraay ( 1976 ) 115 -16 and Martin ( 1985 ) 36 -37 ). Obols: obv . free horse walking; rev . Athena standing; legends: ΦΑΡΚΑ , ΦΑΡΚΑ∆ , ΦΑΡΚΑ∆Ο , ΦΑΡΚΑ∆ΟΝΙΟΝ ; or obv . bull's head; rev . horse's head; legend: ΦΑΡ ; or obv . bull's head; rev . horse's head and trident, or ram; legend: ΦΑ , ΦΑΡ , ΦΑΡΚ .

413,Pharsalos (Pharsalios),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.15,22.2,2109,10222,"413 . Pharsalos (Pharsalios) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 15 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: A. The toponym is Φάρσαλος , ηasper (Pherecydes ( FGrHist 3 ) fr. 1 ; Thuc. 1 . 111 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 6 . 1 . 8 ). The regular city-ethnic is Φαρσάλιος (Xen. Hell . 4 . 3 . 3 ; I.Thessalie 56 (C4 ); and on coins, infra ), though Hippoc. Epid . 6 . 8 . 18 has Φάρσαλος ; Φαρράλιος is found in Hdn. iii . 1 123 . 8 . Pharsalos is called a polis in the urban sense by Thuc. 1 . 111 . 1 , and in Ps.-Skylax 64 Pharsalos is the fifth of nine toponyms listed between the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πόλεις Θετταλῶν ; asty is found in Anac.fr. 107 , Diehl (see Helly ( 1995 ) 43 -44 ). Polis in the political sense is found in Xen. Hell . 6 . 1 . 5 and implicitly at Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 . In the C4 dedication I.Thessalie 56 polis is restored: [ /asperacuteΟ ] µ ηρον Φαρσαλίων ηasper [ πόλις ]; the earliest certain epigraphical reference to a πόλις Φαρσαλίουν is in a C3 decree ( I.Thessalie 50 ). Arist. Pol . 1306 a 11 has the phrase ηasper εν ΦαρσάλΩsubiotaω πολιτεία ; πολῖται is found at Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 34 , and πατρίς in I.Thessalie 57 . 4 ( 330 s); CEG ii 795 ( 330 s); Xen. Hell . 6 . 1 . 13 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C5 -C4 coins (Head, HN ² 306 ) and in I.Thessalie 56 (C4 ), and externally in the Delphic naopoioi 's accounts of 357 / 6 ( CID ii 8 . i . 8 ), in a dedication at Delphi ( SEG 1 210 (C4m)), and in Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 . The external and individual use is found in Thuc. 8 . 92 . 8 ; IG ii² 26 ( 394 -387 ); and CID ii . 4 . i . 31 ( c. 360 ). Pharsalos was situated in Thessalia (Thuc. 1 . 111 . 1 ), more precisely in Phthiotis (Strabo 9 . 5 . 3 , 10 ; Kip ( 1910 ) 68 ). The territory is referred to as γηtilde at Thuc. 1 . 111 . 1 ; it was bounded to the north-east by the territory of Skotoussa and Eretria Phthiotis (Strabo 10 . 1 . 10 says explicitly that Eretria was near Pharsalos, and Polyb. 5 . 9 . 3 that it was near Thebai Phthiotis), to the south by the territories of Peuma and Proerna; and to the west by that of Euhydrion.In the territory were the rivers of Apidanos (Thuc. 4 . 78 . 5 ), Enipeus (Strabo 9 . 5 . 6 ) and Louerchos ( I.Thessalie 50 ). The Thetideion was situated near the eastern border of the Pharsalion pedion (Eur. Andr . 16 with Decourt ( 1990 ) 205 -8 ), and it was most probably the same (on the other bank of the Enipeus) for the place called Palaipharsalos by Strabo 9 . 5 . 6 , 17 . 1 . 11 (Decourt ( 1990 ) 200 -23 ). Two other toponyms are known, but not precisely located: Makouniai ( I.Thessalie 50 (C3l)), possibly near modern Rizi; and Makkarai (Theopomp. fr. 55 ); they may refer to the same place.The ruins called Hellas by Strabo 9 . 5 . 6 were,in his day, 60 stades from Pharsalos, with the two springs of Messeïs and Hypereia close to them.When Philip II of Makedon had destroyed Halos, it was handed over to Pharsalos (Dem. 11 . 1 with schol.). The political system of Pharsalos was clearly a narrow oligarchy: δυναστεία µ αtildeλλον ηgrave ισονο µ ία (Thuc. 4 . 78 . 3 ), οasper µ ονοουtildeσα ολιγαρχία (Arist. Pol . 1305 b ; cf. 1306 a 11 -12 ); and some families, especially the Daochids and the Menonids (on whom see Larsen ( 1968 ) 22 ), are well known from the literary and epigraphical record (on Daochids see, e.g., Béquignon ( 1970 ) 1053 -56 ; Helly ( 1995 ) 51 -52 , 63 -67 ; on Menonids: Helly ( 1995 ) 233 -35 , 263 -64 , 303 -6 ). A stasis is mentioned by Xen. Hell . 6 . 1 . 2 , and this conflict seems to have been solved by granting exceptional powers to a single individual, Polydamas (Gehrke, Stasis 126 ), who was subjected to an annual rendering of accounts ( Hell . 6 . 1 . 2 : απελογίζετο κατ ' ενιαυτόν ). A set of laws ( νό µ οι ) that specified ( inter alia ?) public incomes is referred to at Xen. Hell . 6 . 1 . 2 . The Thessalian cavalry took part in the Lelantine War under the Pharsalian Kleomachos (Arist. fr. 98 , Rose). The city was attacked by Athenians with allies in 457 / 6 , but these forces did not manage to capture the city (Thuc. 1 . 111 . 1 ). Cavalry and an anonymous cavalry commander from Pharsalos are attested in Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 , when the city was allied with Athens (alongside other Thessalian cities); a hipparchos is also mentioned at Xen. Hell . 4 . 3 . 8 and polemarchoi in SEG 1 210 (C4m). With Larisa, Krannon and Skotoussa, Pharsalos is mentioned as being allied with the Boiotians in 395 / 4 (Xen. Hell . 4 . 3 . 3 ). In 374 , Polydamas failed to gain help from Sparta and accordingly had to ally Pharsalos with Jason of Pherai (Xen. Hell . 6 . 1 . 19 ); as tagos , Polyphron II of Pherai had nine citizens of Pharsalos, including Polydamas, executed (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 34 ). A war against Pelinna(ion) in the time of Philip II is mentioned in Polyaen. 4 . 2 . 19 ; Pharsalos was allied with Philip II of Makedon against the Achaian city of Halos (Dem. 11 . 1 ; Strabo 9 . 5 . 8 ), and Kottyphos of Pharsalos was the strategos of the Amphiktyonic League against Amphissa (Aeschin. 3 . 128 ). Pharsalian cavalry fought with Alexander the Great in Asia (Arr. Anab . 3 . 10 . 11 ). According to Diod. 14 . 82 . 6 , Pharsalos, though garrisoned by Lakedaimonians, was captured by Medios of Larisa in 395 , and the inhabitants ( τουgraveς εν αυτηsubiotaηtilde κατοικουtildeντας ) were sold off as booty ( λαφυροπωλεῖν ). Medios may have placed a mercenary garrison in Pharsalos after his capture of the city: Arist. Hist. an . 618 b 13 -14 refers to 'the time when Meidios'mercenaries were killed at Pharsalos' . In 374 Pharsalos may have ruled over an unknown number of unidentifiable but presumably minor poleis : at Hell . 6 . 1 . 8 Xenophon has Jason of Pherai state that if he is joined by Pharsalos and αιasper εξ υasper µ ῶν (sc. τῶν Φαρσαλίων ) ηρτη µ έναι πόλεις he will easily become tagos of Thessalia. Thessalian allies of Pharsalos are implied by Polyaen. 4 . 2 . 19 (r time of Philip II). Thoukydides of Pharsalos was proxenos of Athens (Thuc. 8 . 92 . 8 ), and Polydamas was hereditary proxenos of Sparta (Xen. Hell . 6 . 1 . 4 ); in C4 Daochos was proxenos of Anaphe ( IG xii . 3 251 ( c. 345 -330 )), and Iphitos was honoured by Athens ( IG ii² 26 ). Reception of an Athenian embassy seems implied by Ar. Vesp . 1271 . The patron divinity of Pharsalos was probably Zeus: Olympios ( I.Thessalie 58 (C4e)); Soter (ibid. i 59 (C3l) and 60 (C3s)) or Thaulios (ibid. i 62 -63 (C4 )). The Pharsalians also had cults of Aphrodite Peitho (ibid. i 67 ( 450 -430 )), Apollo (ibid. i 65 (C4s)), Artemis (ibid. i 66 (C3 )), Athena (coins, infra ; cf. Lavva ( 2001 ) 31 -32 , stressing the importance of this goddess), Demeter (Daffa-Nikonanou ( 1973 ) 27 -28 ), Hestia and Symmachos ( I.Thessalie 68 (C4f)), Hermes (ibid. i 69 (C5m)), Pan and the Nymphs (ibid. i 72 (C5f), 73 (C4 )). The locations of the cult sites are uncertain, except that of Pan and the Nymphs in the so-called Alogopati grotto (ibid. i 72 -73 ) and perhaps that of Demeter at Ambelia Pharsalou ( ArchDelt 43 B 1 : 273 (C6l-C5m)), and, of course, the Thetideion ( supra ); the Thetideion is actually called a polis by Pherecydes ( FGrHist 3 ) fr. 1 a, but in a purely mythological context and without implications for its status in the Classical period (cf. Hansen and Nielsen ( 2000 ) 148 -49 ). Several Pharsalians are known as victors in the Panhellenic games: in the Olympic Games victories were won by Phaidros ( Olympionikai 107 , in 556 ) and Agias ( Olympionikai 192 , in 484 ); Pythian victories were won by Agias ( I.Thessalie 57 , in c. 490 -480 ) and Telemachos ( Olympionikai 190 (C5 )); and Agias and Telemachos were both periodonikai (Knab ( 1934 ) nos. 11 -12 ). In 366 -338 , Melanippos of Pharsalos was victorious in the hoplite race at the Amphiaraia at Oropos ( IG vii 414 . 27 -28 ). I.Thessalie 56 (C4 ) is an internal communal dedication, while SEG 1 210 (C4m) is a dedication to Pythian Apollo. Donations of money to Delphi and Argos are attested in CID ii 8 . i . 8 (C4m) and IG iv 617 ( 316 -293 ). Citizens of Pharsalos served the Amphiktyonic League in various capacities: as argyrologos ( CID ii 11 A. 5 , B. 6 ); hieromnemon ( CID ii 32 . 42 , 89 . 6 , 94 . 2 ); naopoios ( CID ii 31 . 72 , 32 . 30 , 33 . 8 , 74 .I. 66 -67 , 79 A. i . 9 , 95 . 6 ) and tamias ( CID ii 74 . i . 42 , 77 . i . 4 ). The acropolis of Pharsalos is mentioned by Xen. Hell . 6 . 1 . 2 , 18 ; it was located on the Profitis Ilias hill, and was c. 500 m long (east-west) and 50 m wide;the preserved walls are all Byzantine.The upper ( c. 750 × 400 m) and the lower ( c. 1 , 500 × 1 , 200 m) town were situated on the northern slope of the hill and in the plain near the Apidanos spring. The walls (polygonal and trapezoidal or rectangular isodomic), not well preserved except near the acropolis itself, are between 2 . 70 m and 4 . 0 m wide. There are remains of four gates and a postern, as well as at least twenty-four towers. Part of the city wall was constructed in C5e (cf. Diod. 11 . 83 . 3 -4 for a poliorkia in 457 / 6 ), but most of it dates to C4s (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 139 -41 ; Katakouta and Toufexis ( 1994 )).A C6l tholos tomb was found outside the circuit wall ( Prakt ( 1951 ) 155 -63 , ( 1952 ) 185 -202 , ( 1953 ) 127 -32 ), but almost nothing is known about the degree of urbanisation during the Archaic and Classical periods: some houses have been excavated, but they all date to the Heltic or Roman periods (see further Lavva ( 2001 ) 4 -10 ). An extensive Archaic-Classical cemetery is located west of the city (ibid. 9 ). Pharsalos struck coins in silver on the Aiginetan standard and bronze between c. 480 and c. 320 . Denominations: drachms,triobols,trihemiobols,obols,hemiobols and fractions in bronze (from C5l). The most common types are: obv . head of Athena, in C4facing; rev . forepart of horse, or horse's head, or horseman (cf. Lavva ( 2001 ) 19 ff); legends: ΦΑΡ or ΦΑΡΣ or ΦΑΡΣΑ or ΦΑΡΣΑΛΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 306 ; for the end of minting, see Martin ( 1985 ) 161 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 1 nos. 1422 -23 , ii. 4 nos. 476 -504 ; Rogers ( 1932 ) 151 -61 ; Lavva ( 2001 ); SNG Cop.Thessaly 217 -33 )."
414,Pherai (Pheraios),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.25,22.45,2295,11026,"414 . Pherai (Pheraios) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 25 , long. 22 . 45 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Φεραί , αιasper (Dem. 1 . 13 ; IG v . 1 948 . 2 (C4 ); Diod. 15 . 61 . 5 ). The city-ethnic is Φεραῖος (Xen. Hell . 2 . 3 . 4 ; SEG 23 416 ( 450 -425 ); IG iv 617 . 4 ( 316 -293 )). Pherai is called a polis in the political sense in SEG 23 433 . 5 (C4 ) and is listed as a polis in this sense at Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 ; polis in the urban sense is found in Dem. 7 . 32 ; at Ps.-Skylax 64 , Pherai is the first toponym listed between the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πόλεις Θετταλῶν ; akropolis is found in Dem. 7 . 32 . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found in SEG 23 416 . 1 ( 450 -425 ) and 417 . 3 (C5l); the external collective use is found in Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 31 ; CID ii 1 . i . 47 ( 362 / 1 ); IG iv617 . 4 ( 316 -293 ); and the external individual use in Xen. Hell . 2 . 3 . 4 ; CID ii 31 . 73 ( 345 ); IG iv² . 1 122 . 26 (C4 ). Pherai was a Thessalian community ( IG v . 1 948 . 2 (C4 )), belonging to the tetras of Pelasgiotis (Strabo 9 . 5 . 10 ). Archaeological material demonstrates the existence of several military installations and second-order settlements (often fortified) in the territory in the Archaic and Classical periods; for details, see Di Salvatore ( 1994 ). Pagasai is described as the epineion of Pherai by Theopomp. fr. 53 (see further the entry for Pagasai, supra ). A C4 decree ( SEG 23 418 ), by extending privileges granted to οasperacuteσσ [ ας γαtildeς ] Φεραῖοι άρχοντι , suggests that the city controlled territory other than the civic territory proper. Early in the Peloponnesian War, Pheraian cavalry assisted the Athenians (Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 ) alongside other Thessalian poleis which were allied to Athens. The C5l-C4 history of Pherai, as it appears from our sources, was dominated by a series of powerful individuals who struggled for panThessalian hegemony, made extensive use of mercenary forces (Parke ( 1933 ) 100 ff), and were referred to as tyrannoi (e.g. Ephor.fr. 95 ; Berve ( 1967 ) 283 -95 ). The first of these was Lykophron I, who in 404 defeated the Larisaians and other Thessalians in battle βουλό µ ενος άρξαι οasperacuteλης τηtildeς Θετταλίας (Xen. Hell . 2 . 3 . 4 ; Westlake ( 1935 ) 54 -55 ); conflict between Lykophron and Larisa continued into the 390 s (Diod. 14 . 81 . 5 (r 395 )), and Lykophron seems to have had Spartan support (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 24 ; Cartledge ( 1987 ) 354 ; Neue Pauly vii. 568 ). Nothing is known about the end of Lykophron's rule; he may have been succeeded by a certain Polyalkes, who may have been a relative of his (Westlake ( 1935 ) 68 ; Berve ( 1967 ) 285 ), but his true successor was his son (Westlake ( 1935 ) 68 ), the famous Jason of Pherai (on whom see Mandel ( 1980 ) and Sprawski ( 1999 )). He appears for the first time c. 382 -379 , when he assisted Neogenes of Histiaia in establishing a tyranny (Diod. 15 . 30 . 3 ; Stylianou ( 1998 ) ad loc .). By the middle of the 370 s, he possessed a mercenary army of 6 , 000 foot and had by force of arms subdued not only Alketas of Epeiros (Xen. Hell . 6 . 1 . 7 ; cf. Hammond ( 1967 ) 524 and Mitchel ( 1984 ) 57 -58 ) but also most of the poleis of Thessalia and made them symmachoi (Xen. Hell . 6 . 1 . 5 ). During the fighting, he was regularly opposed by Pharsalos (ibid.), but Pharsalos itself (presumably with its dependent poleis ) was made a symmachos not by force of arms but by negotiation (Xen. Hell . 6 . 1 . 2 -18 ), after a Pharsalian plea for Spartan assistance had been rejected (ibid.). After this, presumably in 375 / 4 , Jason was elected tagos of Thessalia and went on to organise the military and economic affairs of the Thessalians (Xen. Hell . 6 . 1 . 18 ; Helly ( 1995 ) 345 -53 ); his command of a fleet of triremes is attested by Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 21 , but it is unclear whether the reference is to a Pheraian, a Thessalian, or even a personal navy. His extra-Thessalian policy seems to have been to oppose Sparta (Xen. Hell . 6 . 1 . 10 ; Mandel ( 1980 ) 54 ), and he became an ally of Athens ([Dem.] 49 . 10 ) and possibly a member of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 .B. 15 ; Jehne ( 1991 ); Dreher ( 1995 ) 173 -74 ; see, however, Mitchel ( 1984 ), who restores IG ii² 43 B. 1 -2 as [ Φε ] ραίων [ οasper δ ] ηtilde µ ος and argues that the Pheraians as such, and not Jason, were enrolled as a member of the League); Jason also concluded a treaty of symmachia with King Amyntas of Makedon (Diod. 15 . 60 . 2 ; Stylianou ( 1998 ) ad loc .). As an ally of Thebes, Jason negotiated spondai between the Boiotians and the Lakedaimonians after the battle of Leuktra (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 19 -25 ); on his foreign policy, see in general Westlake ( 1935 ) 84 -102 . Jason was assassinated in 370 / 69 (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 31 ). On his successors, see Westlake ( 1935 ) 126 -95 and Berve ( 1967 ) 289 -95 . In 353 / 2 the tyrants Lykophron II and Peitholaos handed over Pherai to Philip II of Makedon and left the city (Diod. 16 . 37 . 3 , 38 . 1 ; on chronology, see Martin ( 1981 )). Peitholaos may have returned only to be driven out by Philip, according to Diod. 16 . 52 . 9 , 349 / 8 (Westlake ( 1935 ) 183 ; Berve ( 1967 ) 294 ; Buckler ( 1989 ) 106 -7 ). In 344 , Philip defeated a rebellious Pherai and installed a permanent garrison on its acropolis (Dem.[ 7 . 32 ], 8 . 59 , 9 . 12 ; Westlake ( 1935 ) 192 ). Pherai made grants of proxeny to citizens of Opous ( SEG 23 415 ( 450 -425 ); SEG 420 (C4 )), Proerna ( SEG 23 416 ( 450 -425 )), Thebes ( SEG 23 417 (C5l-C4 ); SEG 422 (C4 )), Skotoussa ( SEG 23 419 (C4 )) and Krannon ( SEG 23 421 (C4 )). F.Delphes iii . 4 385 ( 338 -320 ) is possibly a grant of proxeny by Delphi to a citizen of Pherai. Pheraian cavalry are attested at Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 and Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 31 ( τοgrave Φεραίων ιasperππικόν ). The earliest preserved public enactments are two grants of proxeny dating to 450 -425 ( SEG 23 415 -16 ); the term ψε [ φίσ µ ατα ] is found in SEG 23 424 . 6 (C4 ). A board of tagoi is attested by SEG 23 425 . 6 (C4 ). SEG 23 420 (C4 ) contains a grant of προδικία to a man of East Lokrian Opous. The raising of taxes is implied by several grants of ατέλεια (cf. SEG 23 418 , 419 , 420 , 422 , 425 (all C4 )). SEG 23 418 (C4 ) extends privileges granted to οasperacuteσσ [ ας γαtildeς ] Φεραῖοι άρχοντι . Grants of epinomia are found in SEG 23 422 and 424 (both C4 ). There are few remains of the ancient city of Pherai ( RE suppl. vii. 993 -94 ; PECS 702 ), the most important being the remains of a suburban temple of En(n)odia (or En(n)odia and Zeus Thaulios; it was erected in the Doric style in C6e (Béquignon ( 1937 a ) 44 -47 ), and rebuilt in C4l with a peri- style of 6 × 12 columns (Østby ( 1992 ), ( 1994 )). A Dioskoureion in the city is mentioned at Dem. 19 . 158 (cf. Chrysostomou ( 1983 )). A C5e marble statue of Athena was found on the acropolis, which may indicate a sanctuary of the goddess there ( PECS 702 ). Dem. 8 . 59 and 10 . 61 refer to the τείχη of Pherai; the city wall was constructed in C4f (Camp ( 2000 ) 43 ); it is 3 -5 m thick, built of rough-faced rectangular and trapezoidal blocks laid in fairly regular courses ( PECS 702 ) and runs for c. 5 km; at the Athanassios hill, a gate and six towers have been identified (Kakavoyiannis ( 1977 )); the area enclosed measures at least 82 ha ( = the upper city) but perhaps as much as c. 120 (including the lower city; M. Di Salvatore, pers. comm.); to the south-west, there may have been a second wall; to the south it was an emplektron wall ( ArchDelt 50 ( 1995 ) B. 1 : 363 ). The patron divinity was En(n)odia, who is depicted on Classical coins ( infra ; Chrysostomou ( 1998 ); LIMC iii . 1 744 ). Other cults include those of Artemis ( IG ix . 2 417 . 2 (C4 )), the Dioskouroi (Dem. 19 . 158 ), Poseidon (Chrysostomou ( 1998 ) 249 ), Zeus Thaulios (Béquignon ( 1937 a ) 92 , 66 . 2 (Archaic)), as well as those of Aphrodite, Athena, Demeter, Hestia and Themis (Chrysostomou ( 1998 ) 48 -49 ). Citizens of Pherai served the Amphiktyonic League in the capacities of naopoios ( CID ii 31 . 73 , 85 ( 345 ), 74 . i . 69 ( 337 / 6 ), 75 . ii . 40 ( 336 / 5 ), etc.) and hieromnemon ( CID ii 102 . ii .A. 25 ( 324 / 3 ); cf. 118 . 1 ). A monetary donation by Pherai towards the rebuilding of the temple at Delphi is recorded in CID ii 1 . i . 47 ( 362 / 1 ) and one to ' theoroi sent out from Argos to announce the celebration of the Nemean Games and the Heraia'is recorded by IG iv 617 . 4 ( 316 -293 ; Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 -75 , 127 -29 ). Pherai began minting silver coins in C5f, striking drachms, triobols, obols and hemiobols on the Aiginetan standard. Types: obv . Thessalian subduing bull, or head and neck of bull clasped by bull-fighter, or bull's hoof; rev . horse with loose rein and lion's head fountain in incuse square, or horse springing from rock in incuse square, or naked rider in incuse square, or horse's head in incuse square; legends: ΦΕ , ΦΕΡ , ΦΕΡΑ , ΦΕΡΑΙ , ΦΕΡΑΙΟΝ . For similarities between these coins and contemporary coins of Krannon, Larisa, the Perrhaibians, Pharkadon, Trikka and Skotoussa, see Kraay ( 1976 ) 115 -16 and Martin ( 1985 ) 36 -37 . Pherai may, in addition, have been the city that struck coins in the name of the Thessalians c. 470 -450 ; see Kraay ( 1976 ) 116 and Martin ( 1985 ) 37 -38 . For similarities between these putative coins of Pherai and contemporary coins of Skotoussa and Methylion, see ibid.; see, however, Helly ( 1995 ) 229 -30 and Liampi ( 1996 ) 124 -25 . In C4 , drachms and triobols were minted: obv . head of nymph Hypereia, or head of Ennodia, or lion's head; rev . Ennodia with two torches riding on a galloping horse, or standing nymph Hyperia with her hand on lion's head fountain, or lion's head fountain; legends: ΦΕΡΑΙΟΝ , ΦΕΡΑΙΟΥΝ . Bronze coins appear c. 400 : obv . head of Ennodia,or lion's head; rev . lion's head fountain,or Ennodia with torches riding on a horse (two denominations); legend: ΦΕΡΑΙΟΝ . Two of Jason's successors struck coins in their own name. Alexander ( 369 -357 ) struck both silver and bronze coins. Silver (didrachms, drachms, triobols, and obols): obv . head of Ennodia (sometimes with ΕΝΝΟ∆ΙΑΣ added), or young male head in petasos , or wheel; rev . armed horseman prancing, or lion's head, or leg and foot of horse, or double axe; legends: ΑΛΕ , ΑΛΕΞΑΝ∆ΡΕΙΑ , ΑΛΕΞΑΝ∆ΡΕΙΟΝ , ΑΛΕΞΑΝ∆ΡΕΙΟΣ , ΑΛΕΞΑΝ∆ΡΟΥ (of which the adjectival forms denote denominations). Bronze: obv . young male head in petasos , or forepart of rushing bull; rev . leg and foot of horse, or forepart of horse; legend: ΑΛΕΞΑΝ∆ΡΟΥ . T eisiphonos struck bronze coins (two denominations): obv . forepart of rushing bull; rev . forepart of horse; legend: ΤΕΙΣΙΦΟΝΟΥ (Head, HN ² 306 -9 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 1 . 1023 -30 , ii. 4 . 339 -58 ; Rogers ( 1932 ) 162 -68 ; Liampi ( 1996 ) 107 -8 , 112 ; SNG Cop.Thessaly 234 -47 )."
415,Skotoussa (Skotoussaios),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.25,22.35,918,4548,"415 . Skotoussa (Skotoussaios) Map 54 . Lat. 39 . 25 , long. 22 . 35 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Σκοτουtildeσσα , ηasper (Simon. fr. 127 , Page), Σκοτουtildeσα (Ps.Skylax 64 ), Σκοτουtildeσαι (Arist. Mir. ausc . 841 b 9 ) or Σκοτόεσσα (Paus. 7 . 27 . 6 ). The city-ethnic is Σκοτοσσαῖος ( IG ii² 8843 (C4f); SEG 23 419 (C4 )), Σκοτουσσαῖος (Xen. Hell . 4 . 3 . 3 ; SEG 34 452 (C4 )), Σκοτοεσσαῖος ( SEG 43 310 (C3 )); Steph. Byz. 578 . 2 gives Σκοτουσαῖος . In Ps.-Skylax 64 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Skotoussa is one of nine toponyms listed between the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πόλεις Θετταλῶν . The political sense is found at Diod. 15 . 75 . 1 (r 367 ). The earliest epigraphical reference to a πόλις Σκοτοεσσαίουν is in a citizenship decree of C4l-C3e ( SEG 43 310 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins of C5 -C4 ( infra ) and in the decree SEG 43 310 ; externally it is found at Xen. Hell . 4 . 3 . 3 . The external individual use is found in SEG 34 452 (C4 ) and CID ii 10 .A. i . 8 ( 357 / 6 ). Skotoussa was situated in Thessalia ( IG ii² 8843 (C4f); Xen. Hell . 4 . 3 . 3 ), more precisely in Pelasgiotis (Simon. fr. 127 , Page; Kineas ( FGrHist 603 ) fr. 3 ). Its territory included the river Onchestos (Polyb. 17 . 20 . 5 ), Kynos Kephalai (hills and/or kome : Polyb. 18 . 22 . 9 ; Strabo 9 . 5 . 20 ), Melambion (another kome ?: Polyb. 18 . 20 . 6 ) and a hill, Phagoeis (schol. Hom. Il . 16 . 233 α ); none of these toponyms can be equated with sites on the ground. Skotoussa was bounded to the north by the crest line of the Revenia hills, to the east by the territory of Pherai, and to the south by the territories of Eretria Phthiotis and, in particular, Pharsalos (Decourt ( 1990 ) fig. 27 ). Alongside Larisa, Krannon and Pharsalos, Skotoussa is mentioned by Xen. Hell . 4 . 3 . 3 as being allied to the Boiotians in 395 / 4 . Later in C4Skotoussa was conquered by Alexander of Pherai, who in 367 / 6 summoned a meeting of the ekklesia (Diod. 15 . 75 . 1 ) to be held in the theatre (Paus. 6 . 5 . 2 ; cf. Stählin ( 1924 a ) 109 , and Dilke ( 1948 ) 138 -39 ), whereupon he had his mercenaries kill all the participants. A citizen of Skotoussa was appointed as proxenos by Pherai in C4 ( SEG 23 419 ), and one by Delphi c. 320 ( SEG 18 179 ). Skotoussa was a walled and fortified city in 367 (Diod. 15 . 75 . 1 ), but there are no visible remains of the Classical wall, the preserved remains being Heltic (MissailidouDespotidou ( 1993 )). Remains of a wall enclosing the acropolis in the south-western corner of the city could still be seen by Leake in 1809 , but were already badly preserved (Leake ( 1835 ) iv. 454 ff). Skotoussa had cults of Apollo Kerdoios (MissailidouDespotidou ( 1993 ) A 71 ), Asklepios (ibid. A 1 ), Demeter (Moustaka ( 1983 ) 94 (C5s)), Dionysos (ibid. 106 (C4m)), Herakles (ibid. 162 , 163 , 199 (C5l, C4m, C3 )); Peek ( 1974 ) 26 (C5 ); Missailidou-Despotidou ( 1993 ) B 4 -5 (C2 )), Pan and the Nymphs (Volos Museum Λ 764 (C4 )), Poseidon ( ArchDelt 48 B: 257 (C3 ?)), and Zeus (schol. Hom. Il . 16 . 233 α ). Poulydamas of Skotoussa achieved an Olympic victory in the pankration in 408 ( Olympionikai 348 ).

Size of territory: 2 . Type: B. The toponym is presumably Θητώνιον , τό (cf. Hellan.fr. 8 and Keil ( 1899 ) 192 ). The city-ethnic is Θετόνιος in IG ix . 2 257 . 2 (C5m). NoArchaic or Classical source calls Thetonion a polis , but it deserves inclusion in this Inventory because of an honorific decree passed by the Thetonians in C5m ( IG ix . 2257 ) which ( 1 ) attests an eponymous official, a hyloros (cf., however, Sherk ( 1990 ) 259 ); ( 2 ) has the internal collective use of the city-ethnic; ( 3 ) grants a foreigner ασυλία and ατέλεια ; ( 4 ) bestows the title of ευΓaltεργέτας upon him; and ( 5 ) records the magistracy of τάγος in the community itself (see Helly ( 1995 ) 29 -35 ). The expression Θετόνιοι έδοκαν points to a session of an assembly. Finally, the inscription attests to a cult of Apollo Delphinios (ll. 10 -11 ). Thetonion probably belonged to the tetras of Thessaliotis (Helly ( 1995 ) 165 )."
417,Trikka (Trikkaios),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.35,21.45,653,3085,"417 . Trikka (Trikkaios) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 35 , long. 21 . 45 . Size of territory: 2 or 3 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Τρίκ ( κ ) η , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 729 , 4 . 202 ; Strabo 9 . 5 . 17 ) or Τρίκκα ( IG ix . 2 301 . 2 (C2 ); Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 . 41 ). The city-ethnic is Τρικκαῖος ( CID ii 1 . i . 16 ; Diod. 18 . 56 . 5 (r 319 )). In the Delphic naopoioi 's accounts of 362 / 1 ( CID ii 1 ) the Trikkaians are recorded ( i . 16 ) under the heading ταίδε ταtildeν πολίων ήνικαν ( i . 11 ); Strabo 9 . 5 . 17 calls it a phrourion . The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally on C5 coins ( infra ) and externally in CID ii 1 . i . 16 ( 362 / 1 ) and Diod. 18 . 56 . 5 (r 319 ); the external individual use is found in CID ii 48 . i . 46 ( 338 / 7 ), 79 .A. i . 46 ( 334 / 3 ). Trikka was situated in Thessalia ( IG iv² . 1 128 . 29 ( c. 280 ); IG xi . 4 606 fr. b. 8 (C3f)), more specifically in Hestiaotis (Strabo 9 . 5 . 17 ). It is located in north-western Thessalia at modern Trikala. The site was inhabited in the Archaic and Classical periods, but the preserved building remains are all from a later date (Tziaphalias ( 1988 ) 186 -92 ). Diod. 18 . 56 . 5 reports that Trikkaian exiles were explicitly excluded from the general amnesty decreed by Polyperchon in 319 , and this suggests that the city had followed a policy opposed to Philip II of Makedon (Martin ( 1985 ) 104 ; Hammond ( 1994 ) 48 ). Nothing further is known about these exiles, but their very existence indicates a defined body of citizens. The patron divinity was Asklepios, who, according to Strabo, was born at Trikka ( 14 . 1 . 39 ) and there had his oldest and most famous sanctuary ( 9 . 5 . 17 ); the Asklepieion has not yet been identified (Tziaphalias ( 1988 ) 188 -92 ). Coin types ( infra ) suggest cults of Athena and the eponymous nymph. Trikka struck coins in both silver and bronze; the silver issues are dated to 480 -400 , the bronze issues to 400 -344 . ( 1 ) Silver (Aiginetan standard). Triobols: obv . Thessalian subduing bull or forepart of bull; rev . forepart of horse in incuse square; legend: ΤΡΙΚ , ΤΡΙΚΚΑ , ΤΡΙΚΚΑΙ , ΤΡΙΚΚΑΙΟ , ΤΡΙΚΚΑΙΟΝ or ΤΡΙΚΚΑΙΩΝ ; on similarities between these coins and contemporary coins of Krannon, Larisa, the Perrhaibians, Pharkadon, Pherai and Skotoussa, see Kraay ( 1976 ) 115 -16 and Martin ( 1985 ) 36 -37 .

Type: [A] (classified as a fort/tower by Barr ., but see infra ). The toponym has been restored as Αγγεία , ηasper ( εν Αγ [ γείαι ]) in a C3s catalogue of theorodokoi from Delphi ( CID ii p. 26 ). The city-ethnic is Ανγειευacuteς ( CID ii 8 . ii . 16 (C4f)) or Αγγειάτης ( F.Delphes iii . 2 68 . 10 (C2f)). NoArchaic or Classical source calls Angeia a polis ; but in the Delphic naopoioi 's accounts the Ανγειεῖς are recorded in a fragmentary list ( CID ii 8 . ii . 16 ), the heading of which undoubtedly included the formula ταίδε ταtilde µ πολίων ήνικαν (cf. CID ii 5 . ii . 25 -26 ) vel sim . Ager ( 1996 ) no. 65 is a C3l/C2e arbitration between Ktimene and Angeia, which refers to both these communities as poleis (ll. 21 , 25 ). Since the external collective use of the city-ethnic occurs in CID ii 8 . 16 (C4f) to record a collective donation by the Angeians of 100 dr. towards the rebuilding of the temple at Delphi, it was possibly a polis in C4 . Angeia was a Dolopian community ( IG ii² 1132 . 59 (C2 )), but it apparently did not provide the Amphiktyonic League with Dolopian hieromnemones in C4 when these were provided by Ktimene (Lefèvre ( 1998 ) 85 ). At the site (for which see Helly ( 1992 )) are remains of a polygonous circuit with diateichisma , gate and towers (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 149 )."

The city-ethnic is Κτι µ εναῖος ( CID ii 74 . i . 49 ( 337 / 6 )). Ktimene is not explicitly called a polis in any Archaic or Classical source, but the political sense is indirectly attested in the Delphic accounts of 337 / 6 ( CID ii 74 ), where a tamias of Ktimene is recorded ( i . 49 ) after the heading τοgraveν τα µ ίαν αποπέ µ πειν ταgraveς πόλεις ( i . 4 ). For an explicit attestation, see Ager ( 1996 ) no. 65 , a C3l/C2e arbitration between Ktimene and Angeia which refers to both these communities as poleis (ll. 21 , 25 ).

Ktimene was a Dolopian community ( CID ii 74 . i . 49 ; Ap. Rhod. 1 . 68 ) and as such sometimes provided the Amphiktyonic League with the Dolopian hieromnemon ( CID ii 32 . 45 (C4l)). At Ktimene, a C3 wall crowns the acropolis (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 148 ), and a second fortified place was found ' ½ Stunde südöstlich'from Rentina (ibid.). ## 2 . 2 Ainis"

The toponym is ' Υπάτα , ηasper ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 127 ( 230 -220 ); ArchEph ( 1914 ) 88 , 2 . 9 (C3 )) or ' Υπάτη (Arist. Mir.ausc . 843 b 16 ). The city-ethnic is ' Υπαταῖος ( CID ii 3 . 8 ( 362 -357 ); C4f coins ( infra ); IG ix . 2 3 a. 1 (C4 )), and ' Υπαταιευacuteς ( IG iv 617 . 2 ( 316 -293 )). If [ τ ] α [ ίδε ταtildeν πολίων ] and [ ' Υ ] πα [ ταῖοι ] are correctly restored in CID ii 3 . 1 and 8 , then Hypata is there listed as a polis in the political sense; later sources frequently apply polis in the political sense to the city (e.g. IG ix . 2 7 a, passim ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found in IG ix . 2 3 a. 1 (C4 ) and on C4f coins ( infra ). The external collective use is found in CID ii 3 . 8 ( 362 -357 , heavily restored) and IG iv 617 . 2 ( 316 -293 ); see further Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 , 127 -29 . The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested only in Heltic sources, e.g. F.Delphes iii . 4 363 . 2 ( 225 -210 ). Hypata was an Ainian city (Arist. Mir.ausc . 843 b 16 ).At the site are remains of an acropolis wall (Béquignon ( 1937 b ) with fig. 13 ) and a circuit wall, certain parts of which date to C4 -C3 (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 211 ; Béquignon ( 1937 b ) 310 -11 ). Inside the walls are undated remains of walls (Béquignon ( 1937 b ) 310 ). A C4 grant of proxeny (along with epinomia and enktesis ) by Hypata is recorded in IG ix . 2 3 a, which also attests to the existence of a board of άρχοντες ( 3 a. 4 ). Coin types suggest cults of Zeus and Athena; Hermes is attested by IG ix . 2 31 (Hell.?). Apollo Hypataios is attested outside the city itself in Epidauros ( IG iv² . 1 451 (C3 )), and Asklepios Hypataios on Paros ( IG xii . 5 156 ('late') and Thera ( IG xii . 3 suppl. 1330 (C2 )). Relations to Panhellenic sanctuaries are attested by a collective donation of money by the city towards the rebuilding of the temple at Delphi ( CID ii 3 . 8 ( 362 -357 ), heavily restored). IG iv 617 . 2 ( 316 -293 ) records a monetary donation by the Hypataians 'to the θεωροί sent out from Argos to announce the celebration of the Nemean Games and the Heraia' (Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 , 127 -29 ). Hypata struck bronze coins in C4f. Types: obv . laureate head of Zeus and thunderbolt within border of dots; rev .

Laert. 1 . 106 ) or Χηtildeναι , αιasper (Paus. 10 . 24 . 1 ; cf. Diod. 9 . 6 ). The city-ethnic is Χηνευacuteς (Pl. Prt . 343 A; Paus. 10 . 24 . 1 ; Diog. Laert. 1 . 106 ) or Χηναῖος (Musonius Rufus 11 . 39 ; Stob. Flor . 4 . 15 a. 18 . 46 ). Chen is always mentioned in connection with Myson,one of the Seven Sages of the Archaic period (Pl. Prt . 343 A). According to Diog. Laert. 1 . 107 -8 , the location of Chen was subject to dispute already in Antiquity, but there is a reasonably consistent tradition associating it with the area of Oita and Malis (Diod. 9 . 6 ; Paus. 10 . 24 . 1 ; Diog. Laert. 1 . 106 ). Its only claim to inclusion in this Inventory is the existence of an ethnic closely related to the toponym and used as a part of Myson's name as early as Plato ( Prt . 343 A); such a usage is often indicative that the site to whose toponym the ethnic is related was a polis (Hansen ( 1996 ) 182 -87 ), especially in external contexts. If Χηνευacuteς / Χηναῖος is not a sub-ethnic (ibid. 171 -73 , 182 ), then Chen was possibly a polis . However, Χηνευacuteς / Χηναῖος may very well be a sub-ethnic: our sources consistently describe Chen as a kome (Diod. 9 . 6 ; Paus. 10 . 24 . 1 ; Diog. Laert. 1 . 106 ), and Aristoxenos is cited by Diogenes as saying that Myson the Sage did not live in a polis but a kome (Aristox. fr. 130 , Wehrli = Diog.

No Archaic or Classical source calls Parasopioi a polis (Strabo 8 . 6 . 24 , 9 . 2 . 23 calls it a kome in reference to his own day); but it may be included as a probable polis here on account of two Delphic grants of proxeny to men from the community: F.Delphes iii . 1 118 is a grant of 324 / 3 to a man described as Παρασωπιευacuteς , and F.Delphes iii . 2 183 one of c. 300 to an [ Οι ] ταῖος εκ Παρασωπίων .

Not much is known about the history of Echinos: F.Delphes iii . 4 377 = Syll . ³ 222 ( 346 ) is a grant of proxeny by Delphi to an Echinian, and Dem. 9 . 34 implies Theban control of, or influence at, Echinos in the time of Philip II, brought to an end by Philip. Echinos was situated in Malis according to Ps.-Skylax 62 ; the territory is described as γηtilde πά µ φορος by Polyb. 9 . 41 . 11 . The urban history of Archaic/Classical Echinos is unknown, most remains being Heltic; but a piece of isodomic circuit wall undoubtedly dates from C4 ( ArchDelt 43 ([ 1988 ] 1992 ) B. 1 : 211 -16 ). According to Demetrios of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 6 ( apud Strabo 1 . 3 . 20 ), Echinos suffered terribly from an earthquake,presumably the one in 426 (Fossey ( 1990 ) 183 -84 )."

Herakleia is called a polis in the urban sense at Thuc. 3 . 92 . 6 , 93 . 1 and Hermippos fr. 4 . 21 , West; it is called κτίσ µ α at Strabo 9 . 4 . 13 ; polis in the political sense is found at Thuc. 3 . 92 . 4 , 5 . 51 . 1 -2 ; it is called αποικία at Thuc. 3 . 92 . 1 . The C4e coin legend ΗΡΑΚ ( infra ) is presumably an abbreviation of the internal collective city-ethnic; the external collective use of the city-ethnic is found at Thuc. 5 . 51 . 1 -2 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 5 . 6 , 6 . 5 . 23 ; and IG iv 617 . 1 ( 316 -293 ). The external individual use is found at, e.g., CID ii 36 . i . 9 , 35 ( 340 s). Herakleia was founded in 426 by the Lakedaimonians (Thuc. 3 . 92 . 1 ), who provided the three oecists Leon, Alkidas and Damagon (Thuc. 3 . 92 . 5 ). Pressed in war by the Oitaians ( πολέ µ Ωsubiotaω εφθαρ µ ένοι : Thuc. 3 . 92 . 2 ; τουgraveς πλείους τῶν πολιτῶν απέβαλον . . . ερή µ ου ουacuteσης τηtildeς πόλεως : Diod. 12 . 59 . 4 ), the Trachinians (one of the three mere of the Malians; cf. the entry on Trachis infra ) and the Dorians of central Greece had sent an embassy to Lakedaimon (Thuc. 3 . 92 . 2 -3 ). Neither Thucydides nor Diodorus states exactly what was asked of the Lakedaimonians (cf. Malkin ( 1994 ) 221 ), but they decided to grant help in the form of a colony (Thuc. 3 . 92 . 4 ) and proceeded to consult the Delphic oracle, which recommended the foundation (Thuc. 3 . 92 . 5 ). The settlers were drawn from the Spartans themselves, from the perioikoi and from other Hellenes to the exclusion of certain ethne such as the Achaians and the Ionians (Thuc. 3 . 92 . 5 ); Diod. 12 . 59 . 4 says that the settlers were drawn from Lakedaimonians, Peloponnesians and other Hellenes. Thuc. 3 . 92 . 6 presumably means that Herakleia was a new foundation (cf. HCTad loc .; Malkin ( 1994 ) 221 ), and Strabo's statement that Herakleia was 6 stades from the site of Trachis ( 9 . 4 . 13 ) confirms this if the reference is to the original site; however, Diod. 12 . 59 . 3 says that Trachis was renamed Herakleia (cf. Strabo 9 . 4 . 13 ) whereby he possibly means to locate the city at the site of Trachis. If Strabo's statement about the location of Herakleia is accepted as referring to the original site, then Diodorus must be wrong, or his statement about the renaming must be taken to refer to the community , not the site , of old Trachis. That would indicate that the Trachinians themselves were enrolled as citizens of Herakleia (cf. Diod. 14 . 82 . 6 ; Polyaen. 2 . 21 ), as would the fact that a new distribution of land followed the foundation (Diod. 12 . 59 . 5 ). Cf. also Paus. 10 . 22 . 1 (r 280 ), who distinguishes the ruins of old Trachis from the city of Herakleia; and Stählin ( 1924 a ) 208 with fig. 27 at 206 , who locates old Trachis in the lower city of Herakleia. See also Béquignon ( 1937 b ) 244 , who locates old Trachis on the later acropolis of Herakleia; both locations imply that Trachis was merged with Herakleia at the latter's foundation. (Ps.Skylax 62 lists Τραχίς alongside ' Ηράκλεια . However, this is presumably irrelevant for the discussion above, since it is likely that the compiler has merged sources of different dates.) From the outset the ethnic identity of the city was mixed (see supra ). In the context of the Amphiktyonic League, Herakleia counted as Malian,at least in C4s when its citizens are seen serving the Amphiktyony as Malian hieromnemones , of which Herakleia regularly provided one ( CID ii 36 . i . 9 , 35 , ii . 23 ( 340 s), 43 . 27 ( 340 ), 76 . i . 27 ( 335 ), 77 . i . 2 ( 334 / 3 ), 97 . 65 ( 327 / 6 ), 102 . i . 17 ( 324 / 3 ), 102 . ii .A 33 ( 324 / 3 ), 32 . 49 (C4l); cf. 74 . i . 58 ( 337 / 6 ) for one serving as tamias ), the other being provided by Lamia.However,Diod. 18 . 11 . 1 (r 323 ) describes it as Oitaian (cf. Diod. 15 . 57 . 2 ), and so does Strabo ( 9 . 5 . 10 ). According to Thuc. 3 . 93 . 2 , the city was originally populous ( πάνυ πολλουacuteς ); Diod. 12 . 59 . 5 (cf. Ps.-Skymnos 597 ) gives the number of settlers as 10 , 000 ( 4 , 000 Lakedaimonians and other Peloponnesians, and 6 , 000 from the rest of the Hellenes; but see Schaefer ( 1961 )). However, the city was soon depopulated due to Spartan maladministration (Thuc. 3 . 93 . 2 , 5 . 52 . 1 ): the Spartans sent out άρχοντες to govern Herakleia, which was clearly treated as a Spartan dependency (Thuc. 3 . 93 . 2 ; cf. Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 18 , where such a Spartan officer is termed αasperρ µ οστής ; cf. the sketch of the political history infra ). Ten thousand settlers (Diod.; Ps.-Skymnos) is probably not a historical figure, but an ideological number (Schaefer ( 1961 ); for another view, see Helly ( 1995 ) 280 -87 , a discussion of Thessalian military figures). For information on the level of population there are only hoplite numbers vel sim .: in 426 , 500 hoplites served with Sparta (Thuc. 3 . 100 . 2 ), and in 409 / 8 , 700 hoplites fell in battle against the Oitaians (Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 18 ); in 399 , 500 citizens were executed during a stasis (Diod. 14 . 38 . 4 ). But the composition of the population underwent several modifications as the city was drawn into the power struggles of the larger poleis . In 422 / 1 a Spartan army on the march for Thrace interfered in the political life of the city (Thuc. 5 . 12 ). In 420 / 19 , the Herakleots were defeated in battle by the Ainians, Dolopians, Malians and some Thessalians (Thuc. 5 . 51 . 2 ; Diod. 12 . 77 . 4 reporting heavy losses); these people had been hostile towards the foundation from the beginning (Thuc. 5 . 51 . 2 ). In 419 / 18 the Boiotians (possibly sent for by Herakleia itself, cf. Diod. 12 . 77 . 4 ) took over the city and expelled the Spartan archon Agesippidas (Thuc. 5 . 52 . 1 ); however, by 395 it was apparently once again a Spartan ally (Xen. Hell . 3 . 5 . 6 ). In 409 / 8 , the Herakleots again fought the Oitaians, losing 700 men due to betrayal by their Achaian allies (Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 18 ). A stasis is attested for 399 (Diod. 14 . 38 . 4 and infra ); citizens exiled by the Lakedaimonians are reported for 395 (Diod. 14 . 82 . 6 ), and they may have been exiled on this occasion. In 399 , the Spartan officer Herippidas successfully fought off the Oitaian threat (Diod. 14 . 38 . 5 ). In 395 the city was captured (with inside help) by the Boiotians and Argives, who killed captured Lakedaimonians, sent off other Peloponnesians, and restored citizens previously exiled by the Lakedaimonians (Diod. 14 . 82 . 6 -7 ). In 371 / 70 , Jason of Pherai took the city by treachery, razed the walls (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 27 ), made it anastatos , and handed over the territory to the Oitaians and the Malians (Diod. 15 . 57 . 2 ). The community must, however, have been reconstituted, since it appears in C4s: cf. the Delphic inscriptions cited supra and Diod. 18 . 11 . 1 , 56 . 5 . The city was initially an ally of Sparta (Thuc. 3 . 100 . 2 ), and again on later occasions such as the battle of Leuktra (Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 9 ); an alliance with the Phthiotic Achaians is implied by Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 18 . An alliance with Boiotia is attested by Xen. Hell . 6 . 5 . 23 . A stasis occurred in 399 (Diod. 14 . 38 . 4 ): the Lakedaimonians sent out Herippidas to settle the problems; he called a meeting of the ekklesia and proceeded to execute 500 citizens (Diod. 14 . 38 . 4 ); Polyaen. 2 . 21 describes the citizens here executed as Trachinioi ; the exiles restored by the Boiotians and Argives in 395 are likewise described as Trachinioi (Diod. 14 . 82 . 7 ), and this suggests that the city experienced severe difficulties in integrating the Trachinians and the new settlers (Gehrke, Stasis 73 ; Malkin ( 1994 ) 221 -27 ). Exiles are attested in 395 (Diod. 14 . 82 . 6 ) and again in 319 , when they were explicitly excluded from the general amnesty issued by Philip Arrhidaios (Diod. 18 . 56 . 5 ). A citizen of Herakleia is listed as proxenos of Karthaia on Keos in IG xii . 5 542 . 33 (C4m). Herakleia was situated at a distance of 20 stades from the sea, 40 stades from Thermopylai (Thuc. 3 . 92 . 6 ), and 6 stades from the site of Trachis (Strabo 9 . 4 . 13 ). To the west the neighbours were Ainis and Oitaia, to the north Malis and Lamia, and to the south was Doris, and to the south-east Thermopylai. In Strabo's day Parasopias was a kome in the territory ( 8 . 6 . 24 , 9 . 2 . 23 ); in the Classical period it was possibly a polis (see the entry for Parasopioi). Herakleia was fortified at its foundation (Thuc. 3 . 92 . 6 ; cf. Xen. Hell . 6 . 4 . 27 ); traces of fortifications (acropolis wall and city wall) are briefly mentioned by Stählin ( 1924 a ) 207 . Docks ( νεώρια ) were constructed at the foundation as well (Thuc. 3 . 92 . 6 ). The agora is mentioned in IG ix . 2 103 . 9 (C2m).Demetrios of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 6 ( apud Strabo 1 . 3 . 20 ) reports that the city was badly damaged by an earthquake, presumably the one in 426 (Fossey ( 1990 ) 183 ) and thus at or shortly after the foundation. The chief cult was presumably that of Herakles (Diod. 12 . 59 . 4 ); other attested deities are Artemis (Livy 36 . 22 ) and Asklepios (A. Kontogiannis ( 1997 ) 176 ). A festival called Herakleia is attested by IG ix . 1 229 . 10 (C2 ). IG iv 617 . 1 ( 316 -293 ) records a monetary donation by the Herakleots 'to the θεωροί sent out from Argos to announce the celebration of the Nemean Games and the Heraia' (Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 , 127 -29 ). Donations, presumably by individual Herakleots, towards the rebuilding of the temple at Delphi are recorded by CID ii 12 . i . 54 , 56 ( 341 / 40 ). Herakleia struck coins in silver and bronze from C4e.

The toponym is Λα µ ία , ηasper (Ps.Skylax 62 ; Hyp. 6 . 18 ; CID ii 118 . 3 ( c. 365 -360 ); BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 135 ( 230 -220 )); the city-ethnic is Λα µ ιευacuteς ( CID ii 8 . ii . 13 (before 356 ), 32 . 49 ( 325 )). Lamia is called a polis in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 62 ( έστι δεgrave Μαλιευtildeσιν ηasper πρώτη πόλις Λα µ ία ) and Diod. 18 . 12 . 4 (r 323 ); in the political sense, polis is indirectly attested in the Delphic accounts of 337 / 6 ( CID ii 74 ), where a tamias of Lamia is recorded ( i . 57 ) after the heading τοgraveν τα µ ίαν αποπέ µ πειν ταgraveς πόλεις ( i . 4 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4f coins ( infra ) and in IG ix . 260 (C4l); the external collective use is found in CID ii 8 . ii . 13 (before 356 ), Demetrios of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 5 (r 426 ) (cf. Fossey ( 1990 ) 183 -84 ) apud Strabo 1 . 3 . 20 , and Diod. 18 . 11 . 1 (r 323 / 2 ); and the external individual use is found in CID ii 36 . i . 10 ( 343 -340 ), 43 . 5 ( 340 ). Lamia was a Malian community (Ps.-Skylax 62 ; Diod. 18 . 11 . 1 (r 323 ); cf. infra on coins) and regularly provided the Amphiktyonic League with one of the Malian hieromnemones ( CID ii 32 . 49 ( 325 ), 36 . i . 10 ( 343 -340 ), 36 . i . 36 ( 343 -340 ), etc.), the other being provided by Herakleia (Stählin ( 1924 b ) 554 ). (For the possibility that Lamia belonged to Achaia prior to 413 , see Kip ( 1910 ) 42 -43 and Stählin ( 1924 b ) 553 ). A citizen of Lamia served the Amphiktyonic League as tamias ( CID ii 74 . i . 57 ( 337 / 6 )), and another fulfilled an unidentifiable function ( CID ii 118 . 2 -3 ( c. 365 -360 ) with comm.).A collective donation by Lamia of 600 dr. towards the rebuilding of the temple at Delphi is recorded in CID ii 8 . ii . 13 (before 356 ). In contradistinction to the other Malians, the Lamians did not join the Greek alliance during the Lamian War (Diod. 18 . 11 . 1 ) but served Antipatros as a refuge (Diod. 18 . 13 ). A grant of politeia and proxenia to two men of Larisa is attested by IG ix . 2 60 (C4l). The same decree attests to the existence of a board of archons, a strategos , a hipparchos and a grammateus ( 13 -18 ); cf. SEG 16 373 (C3f) attesting to the same magistracies.A grant of ένκτησ [ ι ] ς γαtildeς καιgrave οικίας is included in IG ix . 2 60 . 7 -8 (C4l) as well. According to Demetrios of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 6 , as transmitted by Strabo 1 . 3 . 20 , the city of Lamia suffered considerably from the earthquake of 426 (cf. Fossey ( 1990 ) 183 -84 ), but no details are given. The earliest urban remains at the site are on the acropolis, which rises to 173 m;there are remains of a C6 polygonal fortification wall and of a second phase dating to C5 -C4 (Stählin ( 1924 b ) 548 ; Scranton ( 1941 ) 91 -92 ; Lauffer ( 1989 ) 365 -66 ). During the Lamian War, Antipatros was besieged by Leosthenes in Lamia (Hyp. 6 . 12 ), but its city walls, whose fine construction Diodorus emphasises ( τείχους πολυτελουtildeς κατεσκευασ µ ένου ), were able to withstand the assaults (Diod. 18 . 13 . 1 -3 ). The course of these walls can be traced or reasonably hypothesised for its entirety. The Classical fortification ( c. 400 ) consisted of an inner and an outer wall, the inner running for c. 3 km and the outer for c. 4 km (see the plan in Stählin ( 1924 b ) 549 -50 ), and enclosed an area of 80 ha (ibid. 552 ). Polyaen. 4 . 4 . 2 refers to houses ( oikiai ) in Lamia during the Lamian War. Phalara ( ταgrave Φάλαρα : Polyb. 20 . 10 . 16 ) was, according to Steph.Byz. 656 . 3 , a place πλησίον Λα µ ίας ; it is described by Livy 27 . 30 . 3 as having a 'good harbour'( egregius portus ) and so was probably the harbour of Lamia; its precise location is disputed (cf. Stählin ( 1924 a ) 217 ; Béquignon ( 1937 b ) 295 -97 ; PECS 697 ; Lauffer ( 1989 ) 533 ); it is mentioned as existing in 426 by Strabo 1 . 3 . 20 . The principal divinity was presumably Dionysos, who is depicted on coins ( infra ) and whose sanctuary seems to have been used for publishing official documents ( IG ii² 861 . 28 (C3l)). Babelon, Traité ii. 4 no. 464 is a silver diobol: obv . naked and bearded Herakles seated on rock holding kantharos in extended right hand and club in left; legend: ΛΑ ( ΜΙΕΩΝ ?); rev . hydria in incuse square; legend: ΤΡ ( ΑΧΙΝΙΩΝ ?). If the legends are correctly understood as abbreviations of the city-ethnics of Lamia and Trachis, then this coin may represent a joint issue of these two Malian cities (in which case the coin should predate 426 , which fits Babelon's date of C5m;cf.Babelon, Traité ii. 4 nos. 465 -66 for two other coins possibly to be ascribed to Lamia). However that may be,Lamia is known to have struck in both silver and bronze from c. 400 . Silver (triobols and obols on the Aiginetan standard): obv . head of young ivy-crowned Dionysos; rev . amphora;legend: ΛΑΜΙΕΩΝ .

The toponym is Τρηχίς in Hdt. 7 . 199 , and Τραχίς in Ps.-Skylax 62 and Strabo 9 . 5 . 8 . The city-ethnic is Τραχίνιος (Thuc. 3 . 92 . 2 ) or Τρηχίνιος (Hdt. 7 . 175 . 2 ). Trachis is called a polis in the urban sense in Hdt. 7 . 199 , a passage which also uses the verb πεπόλισται about the city. At Thuc. 3 . 92 . 2 the Τραχίνιοι are described not as a polis , but as one of three µ έρη into which the Malians were subdivided; however, the use of meros need not mean that Trachis was not a polis , as is clear from Hdt. 1 . 145 , where merea is used to describe twelve communities in Peloponnesian Achaia which were all poleis in the Classical period. Moreover, Diod. 12 . 59 . 3 (r 426 ) describes the Trachinioi as the politai of Trachis, and Diod. 14 . 82 . 7 and Polyaen. 2 . 21 use Trachinios in a manner which indicates that it was in fact the city-ethnic of Trachis. On the assumption that Trachinios is a city-ethnic, the following should be noted: the internal collective use is possibly found abbreviated as ΤΡ on C5m coins which may be a joint issue of Trachis and Lamia ( infra ). The external collective use of the city-ethnic is found in Hdt. 7 . 175 . 2 , 217 . 1 ; Thuc. 3 . 92 . 2 ; and Ctesias ( FGrHist 688 ) fr. 13 . 128 (which also implies some social stratification: Τραχινίων οιasper δυνατοί , Καλλιάδης καιgrave Τι µ αφέρνης ). The external individual use is found at Hdt. 7 . 213 . 3 , 214 . 2 . Thuc. 3 . 92 . 2 attests to a war fought by the Trachinians ( πολέ µ Ωsubiotaω εφθαρ µ ένοι ), which implies the existence of armed forces,as may-for what it is worth-Ctesias ( FGrHist 688 ) fr. 13 . 128 ( Θώραξ δεgrave οasper Θεσσαλοgraveς καιgrave Τραχινίων οιasper δυνατοί , Καλλιάδης καιgrave Τι µ αφέρνης , παρηtildeσαν στρατιαgraveν έχοντες ). The sending of an embassy to Lakedaimon is attested by Thuc. 3 . 92 . 2 . The territory is referred to as ηasper γηtilde ηasper Τραχινίη at Hdt. 7 . 199 and as τηtildeς Μηλίδος ηasper Τραχινίη at 7 . 201 . In 426 , the city was either renamed Herakleia or absorbed by a new Sparta-sponsored foundation of that name (see further the entry for Herakleia). Babelon, Traité ii. 4 no. 464 is a C5m silver diobol on the Aiginetan standard: obv . naked and bearded Herakles seated on rock holding kantharos in extended right hand and club in left; legend: ΛΑ ( ΜΙΕΩΝ ?); rev .

A city-ethnic is not attested except in late sources, such as the entry in Steph. Byz. 101 . 16 . In Ps.-Skylax 63 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Antron is the first of five toponyms listed between the heading Αχαιῶν πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πόλεις Αχαιοῖς ; polis in the political sense is not attested, but is possibly implied by Diod. 20 . 110 . 3 (r 302 ). A citizen of Antron served as Delphic theorodokos in 230 -220 ( BCH 45 : v .C(b). 3 ). The history of Antron is almost completely unknown; [Dem.] 10 . 9 states that Philip II 'bought'( επρίατο ) the city, and Diod. 20 . 110 . 3 (r 302 ) that it joined Demetrios after his capture of Larisa Kremaste. Antron was situated in Achaia (Ps.-Skylax 63 ; Strabo 9 . 5 . 8 ). At the site of the city are traces of both an extremely badly preserved acropolis wall (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 182 ) and a polygonal circuit wall (ibid.). At modern Phano a cemetery of Classical and later times has been identified ( ArchDelt 41 ([ 1986 ] 1990 ) Chron . 74 ; 42 ([ 1988 ] 1993 ) B. 1 : 223 and later issues)."

No Archaic or Classical source calls Ekkarra a polis , but polis status is suggested by the bronze coinage of C4s ( infra ). IG ix . 2 223 is a C3l(?) proxeny decree by Ekkarra which uses polis and attests to the existence of archons. Ekkarra was situated in Achaia (Steph. Byz. 58 . 9 ; Livy 32 . 13 . 13 ), and has been located at Kaitsa (Helly ( 1992 ) 85 -89 , pace Stählin ( 1924 a ) 154 ). The site at modern Ano Ktimeni (formerly Ano Dranista) was probably a second-order settlement in its territory.At the site of Ekkarra itself is a C4 circuit wall running for 775 m and with quadrangular towers; the acropolis was separately walled (Stählin ( 1924 a) 159 ; Béquignon ( 1928 ) 463 -65 ).

Strabo 9 . 5 . 8 : οasper Αasperacuteλος ηgrave ηasper Αasperacuteλος , λέγεται γαgraveρ α µ φοτέρως . The city-ethnic is Αasperλευacuteς (Dem. 19 . 36 , 39 ; coins, infra ); Steph. Byz. 78 . 6 cites Sophokles (fr. 998 , Pearson) for the form Αλουacuteσιος and glossographoi for Αacuteλιος . Halos is called polis in the urban sense at Dem. 19 . 39 , and the political sense is presumably implied at Dem. 19 . 36 . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4 -C3 coins ( infra ), and the external collective use is found in Dem. 19 . 36 , 39 . Halos was situated in Achaia (Hdt. 7 . 173 , 197 ; cf. C3 bronze coins with ΑΧ in monogram: Head, HN ² 295 ). Its location, certainly close to the sea (Hdt. 7 . 173 . 1 ; Dem. 19 . 163 ), remains unknown; Reinders ( 1988 ) 159 -63 proposes to locate it at Magoula Plataniotiki. In its territory were some minor settlements, presumably villages (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 176 -77 ; Reinders ( 1988 ) 155 -57 , 161 , 172 ), and a temple with Geometric pottery (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 177 ). Several military installations are attested as well (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 177 , 185 ; Reinders ( 1988 ) 171 ; Haagsma et al . ( 1993 ); ArchDelt 49 ( 1994 ) Chron . 325 -26 ; Malakassioti et al . ( 1994 )), some of them with C4 phases. The urban centre itself, then, remains unlocated ( Barr . follows e.g. PECS in putting it at modern Halmyros, which is unlikely). At 7 . 197 . 2 , Herodotos mentions a prytaneion (called λήιτον in the local dialect), but it is unclear whether it is thought of as belonging to the local community of Halos (so Miller ( 1978 ) no. 324 and Hansen and Fischer-Hansen ( 1994 ) 32 ) or to the Achaians as such. From the mention of a siege by Parmenion at Dem. 19 . 163 ( Αasperacuteλου πολιορκου µ ένου ) it may be inferred that Halos was fortified by C4m; upon its capture, it became depopulated ( ανάστατος . . . γέγονεν , Dem. 19 . 39 ) and the territory was handed over to the Pharsalians (Dem. 11 . 1 ) with whom Halos had had a conflict prior to its capture (Dem. 19 . 36 ). It was refounded in the early Heltic period ( c. 302 ) on the initiative of Demetrios Poliorketes. See Reinders ( 1988 ). A sanctuary of Zeus Laphystios is mentioned by Hdt. 7 . 197 . 1 , where a legend associated with it is recounted. The patron divinity was presumably Artemis Panachaia ( IG ix . 2 add . 205 . i .A. 22 , B. 49 (Hell.)). Halos minted in bronze in C4 -C3 . Types: obv . Zeus Laphystios; rev . Phrixos or Helle with ram; legend: ΑΛΕΩΝ (Head, HN ² 296 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 4 nos. 467 -69 ; Rogers ( 1932 ) nos. 238 -40 ; Reinders ( 1988 ) 236 -51 ; SNG Cop. Thessaly 62 -65 )."
436,Kypaira (Kypharreus),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.0,22.05,262,1264,"436 . Kypaira (Kypharreus) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 00 , long. 22 . 05 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Κυacuteφαιρα , ηasper ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 138 ( 230 -220 )), or Κυacuteπαιρα (Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 . 42 ). The city-ethnic is Κυφαρρευacuteς ( CID ii 2 . i . 21 (C4m)). Kypaira was situated at Kydonia according to Helly ( 1992 ) 79 -80 (followed by Barr .), who rejects Kaitsa (championed by Stählin ( 1924 a ) 159 -60 and Béquignon ( 1937 b ) 336 ). At Kydonia are undated remains of an upper circuit measuring 120 × 40 m with a width of 2 -2 . 5 m, constructed in rectangular blocks in regular courses; three towers are preserved; to the south is a poorly preserved lower circuit (Béquignon ( 1937 b ) 326 -29 , fig. 17 ). According to Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 . 42 , Kypaira was situated in Thessaliotis, but its geographical position puts it in Achaia (cf. Kip ( 1910 ) 73 ). Kypaira is listed as a polis in the political sense in CID ii 4 . 3 -4 , 12 (C4m); cf. 1 . i . 11 , 21 (C4m).These same sources attest to the external collective use of the city-ethnic. Apart from these inscriptions, the information on Kypaira postdates our period,but worth noting is BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 138 ( 230 -220 ) listing αasper πόλις as theorodokos of Delphi."
437,Larisa (Larisaios),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,38.55,22.5,635,2873,"437 . Larisa (Larisaios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 55 , long. 22 . 50 . Size of territory: ? Type: [A]. The toponym is Λάρισσα (Ps.Skylax 63 ), specified as Λάρισσα ηasper Κρε µ αστή by Heracl. Cret. 3 . 2 ( GGM i 109 ) and Polyb. 18 . 38 . 3 ; Strabo 9 . 5 . 13 men- tions another epithet: Πελασγία (cf. Steph. Byz. 412 . 19 ). The city-ethnic is Λαρισαῖος ( CID ii 78 . i . 54 ( 337 / 6 )), specified as [ Λα ] ρισαῖος εκ Φθι [ ώτιδος ] in IG xii . 5 542 . 32 (C4 ). In Ps.-Skylax 63 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Larisa is the second of five toponyms listed between the heading Αχαιῶν πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πόλεις Αχαιοῖς ; the urban sense of polis is found in Diod. 20 . 110 . 2 (r 302 ) as well. The political sense is indirectly attested in the Delphic accounts of 337 / 6 ( CID ii 74 ), where a tamias of Larisa is recorded ( i . 54 ) after the heading τοgraveν τα µ ίαν αποπέ µ πειν ταgraveς πόλεις ( i . 4 ). For an explicit attestation, see an undated inscription from the city itself ( IG ix . 2 94 . 5 ). The internal collective use of the cityethnic is found on C4l/C3e coins (Rogers ( 1932 ) no. 312 ), the external use in Demetrios of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 6 apud Strabo 1 . 3 . 20 (r 426 ) (cf. Fossey ( 1990 ) 183 -84 ) and Diod. 20 . 110 . 2 (r 302 ). The external individual use is found in, e.g., CID ii 118 . 6 -7 ( 365 -360 ), 78 . i . 38 ( 337 / 6 ); IG xii . 5 542 . 32 (C4 ). A citizen of Larisa is listed in a C4 catalogue of proxenoi from Karthaia on Keos ( IG xii . 5 542 . 32 ). Larisa was situated in Achaia (Heracl. Cret. 3 . 2 ; IG xii . 5 542 . 32 (C4 ); Syll . ³ 492 . 36 ( 232 )) and was thus an Achaian community ( CID ii 78 . i . 38 ( 337 / 6 )); the city regularly provided the Amphiktyonic League with one of the Achaian hieromnemones ( CID ii 32 . 47 , 74 . i . 38 , 76 . i . 23 , 86 . 16 , 118 . 6 ), the other being provided by Melitaia. According to Strabo 9 . 5 . 13 , Larisa was situated 20 stades from the coast; Diod. 20 . 110 . 2 (r 302 ) mentions a harbour ( limen ) at Larisa. The Archaic/Classical urban history of Larisa is almost unknown, all remains being Heltic (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 182 -84 ), but a city was presumably in existence in C5l since, according to Demetrios of Kallatis ( FGrHist 85 ) fr. 6 ( apud Strabo 1 . 3 . 20 ), Larisa suffered seriously from an earthquake, certainly the one in 426 (Fossey ( 1990 ) 183 -84 ). Larisa struck bronze coins in C4l/C3e; types vary, the most interesting being obv . head of, presumably, Achilles; rev . Thetis riding on a sea-horse and carrying the shield of Achilles; legend: ΛΑΡΙ , ΛΑΡΙΣΑΙΩΝ and ΑΧΑΙΩΝ in monogram (Rogers ( 1932 ) no. 312 ; SNG Cop. Thessaly 151 -52 ). For a possible C4 bronze state seal of the city depicting obv . riding Thetis bringing shield + ΛΑ ; rev . Skylla, see Robinson ( 1934 )."
438,Melitaia (Melitaieus),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.0,22.25,548,2693,"438 . Melitaia (Melitaieus) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 00 , long. 22 . 25 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Μελιταία , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 63 ), Μελίτεια (Thuc. 4 . 78 . 1 ; Theopomp.fr. 373 ), or Μελιτέα ( CID ii 118 . 6 (C4m)). The city-ethnic is Μελιταιευacuteς (Ephor. fr. 95 . 4 ; CID ii 74 . i . 38 ; C4 coins, infra ). In Ps.-Skylax 63 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Melitaia is the third of five toponyms listed between the heading Αχαιῶν πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πόλεις Αχαιοῖς . The political sense is indirectly attested in the Delphic accounts of 337 / 6 ( CID ii 74 ), where a tamias of Melitaia is recorded ( i . 53 ) after the heading τοgraveν τα µ ίαν αποπέ µ πειν ταgraveς πόλεις ( i . 4 ). An explicit attestation of the political sense is found in IG ix . 2 208 . 3 (C3e). The internal and collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4m coins (Head, HN ² 301 ). The external and individual use is found in CID ii 32 . 47 (C4l), 74 . i . 38 ( 337 / 6 ). The external and collective use is found in Ephor. fr. 95 . 4 . According to Ephor.fr. 95 , the Melitaians had at one point entertained friendly relations with the tyrants of Pherai, but apart from that the political history of the city is unknown; a citizen of Melitaia was granted proxeny by Delphi in 271 ( F.Delphes iii . 2 187 ). An inscription of c. 140 (Ager ( 1996 ) no. 156 ) refers retrospectively to a possibly C4 arbitration between Melitaia and Narthakion (Ager ( 1989 ) 108 ). Melitaia was situated in Achaia (Thuc. 4 . 78 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 63 ; CID ii 118 . 5 -6 (C4m)). The city regularly provided the Amphiktyonic League with one of the Achaian hieromnemones (e.g. CID ii 32 . 47 (C4l), 79 A. ii . 14 ( 334 / 3 )), the other being provided by Larisa. The territory is referred to as ηasper τῶν Μελιταιῶν χώρα at Polyb. 18 . 6 . 4 ; c. 270 -260 its borders were regulated by international arbitration (Ager ( 1996 ) no. 30 ). At the site of the city, traces of a circuit wall, running for c. 4 km,are visible, constructed in irregular rectangular blocks (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 162 ). At modern Haloni a C4sanctuary of Asklepios has been found ( BCH 96 ( 1972 ) 711 ). In C4m Melitaia struck coins in both silver and bronze. ( 1 ) Silver. Denominations: drachm, diobol, obol on the Aiginetan standard. Obv . head of Zeus, or of young Dionysos; rev . bull, or lion's head, or bee (alluding to the name of the city); legends: ΜΕ , ΜΕΛ , ΜΕΛΙ and ΜΕΛΙΤΑΙΩΝ . ( 2 ) Bronze. Obv . head of Zeus; rev . bee; legend: ΜΕΛΙ , ΜΕΛΙΤΑΙΕΩΝ (Head, HN ² 301 ; Babelon, Traité ii. 4 nos. 470 -74 ; Rogers ( 1932 ) nos. 394 -401 ; SNG Cop.Thessaly 172 -73 )."

The toponym is Πευtilde µ α , τό ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 39 ( 230 -220 )). The city-ethnic is Πευ µ άτιος (C3e coins, infra ; Arvanitopoulos ( 1909 ) 451 ( c. 300 ); I.Thessalie 131 (C2e)). Peuma is called a polis in the political sense in a C2e honorific decree ( I.Thessalie 131 ) and implicitly in F.Delphes iii . 4 351 (C3m). In I.Thessalie 131 πολῖται is found as well as the internal collective use of the city-ethnic.The external collective use is found in F.Delphes iii . 4 351 , and the external and individual use is attested in, e.g., Arvanitopoulos ( 1909 ) 451 (Demetrias, c. 300 ). On a retrospective interpretation of these sources it can be presumed that Peuma was a polis in C4s. Peuma was situated in Achaia. F.Delphes iii . 4 351 (C3m) records a boundary and territorial conflict between Peuma and at least two of its neighbours,Meliteia and Chalai,a conflict which the city lost by arbitration (cf. Cantarelli ( 1995 )). In 230 -220 , two Delphic therorodokoi resided in Peuma ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 39 , v . 25 ). The well-preserved remains of Peuma at Kallithea/Kislar date to the very end of C4 or, better, to the beginning of C3 . The fortification comprises a circuit wall c. 2 , 400 m long, with many towers and several gates, a diateichisma and a small acropolis with towers, perhaps of an earlier date. Remains of civic buildings (agora and cisterns) and houses as well as streets are still visible on the top of the flat hill. Peuma struck bronze coins c. 302 -286 . Types: obv . head of nymph; rev . helmet and Achaean monogram; legend: ΠΕΥΜΑΤΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 304 ; Rogers ( 1932 ) nos. 442 -43 ; SNG Cop.Thessaly 198 )."

441,Proerna (Proernios),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.15,22.15,440,2125,"441 . Proerna (Proernios) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 15 , long. 22 . 15 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Προέρνα , ηasper (Daffa-Nikonanou ( 1973 ) 34 -35 (C2 ); Strabo 9 . 5 . 10 ). The city-ethnic is Προέρνιος ( CID ii 8 . i . 12 ( 338 / 7 )) or Πρωέρνιος (coins ( c. 300 -200 ), infra ); in SEG 23 416 . 7 ( 450 -425 ), Προέλνιος is presumably a variant form of the city-ethnic. No Archaic or Classical source explicitly calls Proerna a polis , but it merits inclusion here on account of ( 1 ) SEG 23 416 ( 450 -425 ), a grant of proxeny by Pherai to men described as Προέλνιοι ( = external individual use of the city-ethnic), and thus presumably citizens of Proerna ( supra ); ( 2 ) in the Delphic naopoioi 's accounts the Proernians are presumably recorded in a fragmentary list ( CID ii 8 . i . 12 : [ Προέρ ] νιοι ( = external collective use of the city-ethnic)), the heading of which undoubtedly included the formula: ταίδε ταtilde µ πολίων ήνικαν ( CID ii 5 . ii . 25 -26 ) vel sim .; ( 3 ) furthermore, coins dated c. 306 -283 (Rogers ( 1932 ) no. 534 ) indicate the prior existence of the community in C4s; ( 4 ) the fact that a man of Proerna served as Delphic theorodokos in C3may also be of some significance (see the note on Proerna in CID ii p. 26 ). Proerna probably belonged to Achaia (Strabo 9 . 5 . 10 ; Kip ( 1910 ) 70 -71 ). At the site are remains of a trapezoidal circuit wall in grey limestone with an average width of c. 2 . 5 m and at least three gates or posterns; it may go back to C4 but has seen many repairs. The acropolis itself was walled as well (Daux and La Coste Messelière ( 1924 ) 356 -59 ; Stählin ( 1924 a ) 157 -58 ). Some remains of the lower city have been excavated to the south of the Tapsi hill (Papakonstantinou ( 1994 ) 236 -38 ). Outside the city-wall too is a C5 -C4sanctuary of Demeter, where numerous votives, etc., have been found (Daffa-Nikonanou ( 1973 )). Proerna struck bronze coins c. 306 -283 . Types: obv . head of nymph facing; rev . Demeter with torch and corn-ears; legend: ΠΡΩΕΡΝΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 309 ; Rogers ( 1932 ) no. 534 ; SNG Cop.Thessaly 248 )."

The toponym is Πυacuteρασος , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 695 ; Strabo 9 . 5 . 14 ); the city-ethnic is Πυράσιος (Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 with Helly ( 1995 ) 233 n. 88 ). Strabo 9 . 5 . 14 gives ∆η µ ήτριον as the contemporary name of Pyrasos and a ∆η µ ήτριον is listed by Ps.-Skylax 63 among the cities of Achaia. Pyrasos is listed by Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 (for which see Helly ( 1995 ) 233 n. 88 ) as a polis in the political sense. In Ps.-Skylax 63 , Demetrion is the fourth of five toponyms listed after the heading Αχαιῶν πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and followed by εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πόλεις Αχαιοῖς , but here the reference may be to the community as absorbed by the synoecism of Thebai Phthiotides (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 174 ; RE xxiv. 12 ). The external collective use of the city-ethnic is found in Thuc. 2 . 22 . 3 . Given its geographical location in Achaia, compared with Thucydides' description of it as Thessalian ( 2 . 22 . 3 ), a good parallel to the status of Pyrasos (i.e. a polis of Thessalian Pelasgiotis geographically situated in Achaia) would be Pagasai (cf. Helly ( 1995 ) 233 n. 88 with refs.). Ps.-Skylax describes it as belonging to the Achaians (cf. Steph. Byz. 541 . 2 ), and it seems that the city was synoecised into Thebai Phthiotides (no. 444 ) some time in C4 (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 174 ; RE xxiv. 12 ). See further the entry for Thebai Phthiotides. According to Strabo 9 . 5 . 14 , Pyrasos had been ( ηtildeν ) a polis with a good harbour and a sanctuary of Demeter."
443,Thaumakoi (Thaumakos),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.1,22.2,394,1886,"443 . Thaumakoi (Thaumakos) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 10 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 or 3 . Type: B(?). The toponym is Θαυ µ ακοί (Strabo 9 . 5 . 10 ), or, by confusion with the Homeric Θαυ µ ακίη in Magnesia (Hom. Il . 2 . 716 ), Θαυ µ ακία ( AG 7 544 . 2 ; Steph. Byz. 307 . 5 ). The city-ethnic is Θαυ µ ακός ( IG ix . 2 216 . 1 (C3e)). Possibly the external individual use is attested already in ArchDelt 26 ( 1971 ) B. 1 237 . 4 : ΘΑΥΜΑΚΩ vac. (C4 ). The earliest attestation of a πόλις Θαυ µ ακῶν is in IG ix . 2 216 . 1 , 12 (C3e), an inscription that records two grants of proxeny and other privileges, and refers to a board of archons. However, an inscription of C4 ( ArchDelt 26 : B. 1 237 ) is possibly a grant of proxeny, etc. to a citizen of Thaumakoi; so Thaumakos may be included in this Inventory as a possible polis . An unattributed epigram of the Anthologia Graeca ( 7 544 . 2 ) refers to Thaumakoi as a πόλις αρχαία . Thaumakoi was situated on the main road between the Spercheios valley to the south and the Koile to the north, in Achaia (Strabo 8 . 8 . 5 ; AG 7 544 ; Steph. Byz. 307 . 5 ; Eust. Il . 513 .). According to Strabo 8 . 8 . 5 (quoting Artemidoros), Thaumakoi was 500 stades from Kirrha via Herakleia, and 340 from Larisa. The acropolis is situated under the mediaeval kastro (rising to 639 m),immediately west of the road (Daux and de La Coste Messelière ( 1924 ) 354 ; RE ² v. 2 . 1332 ); it has a rough rectangular shape measuring c. 100 × 70 m. The upper town was enclosed by a circuit running for c. 800 -900 m;it is constructed in polygonal or rectangular isodomic masonry, but is not very well preserved; there is evidence for two semicircular towers; short stretches of the circuit wall date to C4 , but the remains are mainly later ( PECS 324 ; Papakonstantinou ( 1994 ) 235 ). A lower city probably existed, but nothing is known about it."
444,Thebai (Thebaios),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.15,22.45,965,4683,"444 . Thebai (Thebaios) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 15 , long. 22 . 45 . Size of territory: 4 ( RE ² v. 2 . 1584 ). Type: [A]. The toponym is Θηtildeβαι , αιasper (Ps.-Skylax 63 ; Diod. 20 . 110 . 3 (r 302 )), distinguished from that of homonyms by the addition of αιasper Αχαίδες (Heracl. Cret. 3 . 2 ( GGM i )), or ( αιasper ) Φθιώτιδες (Diod. 26 . 9 ; Strabo 9 . 5 . 6 ) or Φθιώτιδος (Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 . 14 ); according to Steph. Byz. 666 . 6 , it was also called Φίλιπποι ( εκλήθησαν Φίλιπποι καιgrave αιasper Θηtildeβαι Θεσσαλίας ). The city-ethnic is Θηβαῖος (Diod. 18 . 11 . 1 (r 323 )); in SEG 12 375 . 5 ( 242 ) it was specified in some way now lost; in IG vii 288 (C3m) it is distinguished from that of homonyms by the addition of εξ Αχαιdieresisacuteας τηtildeς Φθιώτιδος . In Ps.-Skylax 63 , Thebai is the last of five toponyms listed between the heading Αχαιῶν πόλεις αιasperacuteδε and the addendum εισιgrave δεgrave καιgrave άλλαι πόλεις Αχαιοῖς . Thebai refers to itself as a polis in the political sense in SEG 12 372 ( 242 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally on coins of C4l ( infra ) and externally in Diod. 18 . 11 . 1 (r 323 ). The external individual use is found in IG vii 288 (C3m). Thebai belonged to Achaia (Ps.-Skylax 63 ; Diod. 18 . 11 . 1 (r 323 )). T o the north the neighbour was Pherai,to the northeast it was Amphanai, to the east (until C4s) Pyrasos, to the south Halos, to the south-west Peuma, and to the west Eretria and Pharsalos. On the territory, see di Salvatore (( 1994 ): minor settlements and fortresses). On the frontier with Halos was a sanctuary of Athena shared by the two adjoining cities ( BCH 59 ( 1935 ) 208 -9 ). In contradistinction to the rest of the Achaians, the Thebans did not join the Greek alliance opposing Makedonia in the Lamian War (Diod. 18 . 11 . 1 ). A board of αρχέσκοποι is attested by a C4l dedication ( IG ix . 2 1322 ; cf. Prakt ( 1907 ) 165 ). Recent rescue excavations have revealed a city with cemetery, antedating C4f and situated on the western slope of the hill on which Thebai itself lay ( ArchDelt 47 ( 1992 ) 222 -29 ); Heracl. Cret. 3 . 2 ( GGM i ) claims that Φυλάκη was an earlier name of Thebai, and the present site may possibly be that of Phylake; a synoecism of Phylake and Pyrasos is commonly assumed to have occurred in C4s ( RE ² v. 2 . 1587 -88 ) and is presumably to be regarded as the founding of Thebai (in which case the pre-C4s evidence from the site, notably that belonging to the cult of Athena Polias, strictly speaking belongs to Phylake, which must then be regarded as a polis (type B) in its own right prior to the synoecism); a Demetrion is listed as a polis in the urban sense under the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε by Ps.-Skylax 64 , and the reference may be to Pyrasos (renamed as Demetrion at one point; cf. Strabo 9 . 5 . 14 ) as absorbed by the synoecism of Thebai (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 174 ; RE xxiv. 12 ) and functioning as the harbour of Thebai (cf. Hansen ( 1997 ) 36 -37 ). Cf. Diod. 20 . 110 . 3 for a planned C4l expansion of the synoecism attempted by Kassandros but prevented by Dionysios Poliorketes. A cult of Athena Polias is attested by a C4l dedication ( IG ix. 2 1322 ; cf. Prakt ( 1907 ) 165 ); by C6she had a temple on the acropolis ( Prakt ( 1907 ) 161 , ( 1908 ) 163 ), which was rebuilt in C5 and again in C4 ( ArchDelt 49 ( 1994 ) 324 ). The acropolis itself measures 1 . 9 ha ( RE ² v. 2 . 1584 ) and shows remains of a 'sehr altertümlischen kyklopischen Mauer' ( RE ² v. 2 . 1584 ). On the north and west sides an isodomic wall was added in the early Heltic period ( RE ² v. 2 . 1584 -85 ). The C4l/C3e ( RE ² v. 2 . 1589 ) circuit wall runs for 2 , 400 m and encloses an area of 40 ha ( RE ² v. 2 . 1585 ). It consisted of an isodomic stone socle supporting a mudbrick wall; some forty towers are discernible. For a recent plan, see ArchDelt 47 ( 1992 ) Chron . 224 . Outside the circuit are cemeteries (Adrimi-Sismani ( 2000 )). A C4 -C3stoa with wooden columns is reported in Prakt ( 1907 ) 162 . In C4m a theatre was constructed ( ArchDelt 47 ( 1992 ) Chron . 222 -25 ). In addition to Athena Polias, cults included those of Athena Illais ( Prakt ( 1908 ) 171 -72 , 175 (C4 )), Demeter Panachaia ( SEG 25 643 (Hell.); coins, infra ), Protesilaos (Pind. Isthm . 1 . 58 ; coins, infra ), Nika ( Prakt ( 1907 ) 171 -72 , 175 (C4 )) and Leukothea (ibid. (C4 -C3 )).

For the location, see Helly ( 1987 ) 152 -53 and Tziaphalias ( 1994 a ). The toponym is Αacute µ υρος , ηasper (Hes. fr. 59 . 3 ; Steph. Byz. 88 . 11 ); according to Steph. Byz. 89 . 2 -3 , the C4 -C3 writer Suidas used the toponym Α µ υρική ( = FGrHist 602 , fr. 4 ). In Ps.-Skylax 65 , Μυacuteραι is presumably a corruption of Αacute µ υρος . The cityethnic is Α µ υρευacuteς ( IG ii² 5227 (C4l/C3e?)); according to Steph. Byz. 88 . 15 , Eupolis ( = fr. 423 ( PCG )) used the cityethnic Αacute µ υρος ( = Α µ υacuteριος ?; cf. 708 . 12 ); Steph. Byz. 88 . 16 suggests Α µ υραῖος as an alternative. NoArchaic or Classical source calls Amyros a polis , but as paraphrased by Steph. Byz. ( 89 . 2 ), Suidas ( FGrHist 602 ) fr. 4 may have classified Amyrike as a polis ( καιgrave τηgraveν πόλιν Α µ υρικηgraveν καλεῖ ), and if the restoration of Αacute µ υρος in Ps.Skylax 65 is accepted, Amyros is there one of the cities mentioned under the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε . That Amyros was a polis is also indicated by the occurrence of the external collective city-ethnic (Eupolis fr. 423 ( PCG )) and IG ii² 5227 (C4 -C3e(?)), a sepulchral inscription set up by the city of Kasthanaie to commemorate Μαγνήτων Α µ υρεῖς , who had fallen in battle; the external collective use of the cityethnic and the existence of Amyrian troops both indicate that it may have been a polis in C4l/C3e, and since the city certainly existed prior to C4l, it may possibly have been a polis . However, the site identified as Amyros was abandoned c. 400 , and no new site of the Amyreis has been identified; the community may possibly have been installed somewhere else, perhaps at Kasthanaie. It was a Magnesian community ( IG ii² 5227 (C4 -C3e) and Ps.-Skylax 65 if the restoration Αacute µ υρος for Μυacuteραι is accepted)."

On the basis of the types (which recall those of Larisa, as Stählin ( 1924 a ) 227 noted) the Eureaioi may possibly be assigned to Pelasgiotis; but, also on the basis of the types, Moustaka ( 1983 ) 45 assigned them to Magnesia (cf. Westlake ( 1935 ) 4 with n. 2 ). The Dionysiac iconography and the style of the coins along with the letter Λ do in fact associate these coins with those of Eurymenai, and it is not impossible that they indeed belong to this city. However, if they belong to an otherwise unattested community, this community may be classed as a possible polis in C4m."

Homolion is called a polis in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 33 . The political sense is indirectly attested in the Delphic accounts of 362 / 1 ( CID ii 1 ), where the city is listed ( i . 18 ) under the heading [ ταtilde µ πολίων ήνικ ] αν ( i . 11 ), and those of 337 / 6 ( CID ii 74 ), where a tamias of Homolion is recorded ( i . 55 ) after the heading τοgraveν τα µ ίαν αποπέ µ πειν ταgraveς πόλεις ( i . 4 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4 coins ( infra ); the external collective use is found in CID ii 1 . i . 18 ( 362 / 1 ). The external individual use is found in CID ii 32 . 48 (C4l) and 74 . i . 55 ( 337 / 6 ). Homolion was a Magnesian city (Ps.-Skylax 33 ; CID ii 74 . i . 55 ( 337 / 6 )); for the location, Ap. Rhod. 1 . 594 -95 is clear, and pace Stählin ( 1924 a ) 46 -47 and Giesinger ( 1956 ), it should be located at Palaiokastro Karitsas, though the only evidence there is a Byzantine wall (Helly (forthcoming ( b ))), and not in the immediate vicinity of Tempe at modern Homolio, formerly Laspochori ( PECS , etc., followed by Barr .). Homolion regularly provided the Amphiktyonic League with one of the Magnesian hieromnemones (e.g. CID ii 32 . 48 (C4l), 74 . 40 ( 337 / 6 ); see Lefèvre ( 1998 ) 89 ), the other being provided by Korakai, Methone or Olizon; an Amphiktyonic tamias provided by Homolion is listed in CID ii 74 . 55 ( 337 / 6 ). A donation of 300 dr. toward the rebuilding of the temple at Delphi is attested by CID ii 1 . i . 18 ( 362 / 1 ), and IG iv 617 . 13 ( 316 -293 ) records a monetary donation by Homoloion 'to the θεωροί sent out from Argos to announce the celebration of the Nemean Games and the Heraia' (Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 , 127 -29 ). In 360 / 59 , a citizen of Homolion served as Epidaurian theorodokos ( IG iv² . 1 94 i .b. 6 ). In C4 , Homolion struck bronze coins.

The toponym is ' Ιαολκός (Pind. Pyth . 4 . 77 ), ' Ιαωλκός ( Hymn. Hom. Ap . 218 ), or ' Ιωλκός (Hdt. 5 . 94 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 65 ), ηasper (Pind. Pyth . 4 . 77 ) and οasper (schol. Pind. Nem . 3 . 57 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ιωλκευacuteς on C4f coins ( infra ) and ' Ιώλκιος in a decree of 276 -236 (Meyer ( 1936 )). Iolkos is primarily connected with Thessalian mythology (Bakhuizen ( 1996 ) 89 -90 ), and evidence for the historical community is exiguous (ibid. 103 ). By C6l at the latest, it must have been a dependency of the Thessalians:it is reported by Hdt. 5 . 94 . 1 that the Thessalians offered Iolkos to the Athenian tyrant Hippias upon his expulsion from Athens in 511 / 10 . The evidence for its polis status is C4s: in Ps.-Skylax 65 Iolkos is the first toponym listed after the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense, and the city struck coins inscribed ΙΩΛΚΕΩΝ (A. Furtwängler and K. Liampi, pers. comm.; no further details). In C4s, Iolkos was a Magnesian city (Ps.-Skylax 65 ), and it is commonly located at Kastro Volou (so Barr .; cf. Indzesiloglou ( 1994 )). Here is a settlement with which are associated inter al . C6 and C5 graves (Lauffer ( 1989 ) 709 ) and remains of a temple ( RE ix. 1853 ). The principal divinity was Artemis (Meyer ( 1936 ) 371 )."

Kasthanaie is called a polis in the urban sense by Herodotos ( 7 . 183 . 3 , 188 . 1 ). The (external?) collective use of the city-ethnic is found in IG ii² 5227 . 1 (C4l/C3e), a sepulchral inscription set up by the city of Kasthanaie to commemorate Μαγνήτων Α µ υρεῖς , who had fallen in battle. Kasthanaie was a Magnesian city (Hdt. 7 . 183 . 3 ), situated right on the coast.At the site are remains of C5 isodomic fortifications of both the acropolis and the lower city (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 51 -52 ; Pritchett ( 1963 ) 3 ; Müller ( 1987 ) 332 -34 with Abb. 1 -3 )."

In Ps.-Skylax 65 is a reference to a Magnesian settlement by the name of Κορακαί , listed between Methone and Spalauthra. Delphic inscriptions mention a Magnesian ethnic as Κροκαῖος ( CID II 5 .III. 36 ( 362 -360 )) or Κοροκαῖος ( CID ii 32 . 48 (C4l)), and it seems reasonable to regard the K(o)rokaioi as the inhabitants of Korakai (cf. Stählin ( 1921 ) 1371 ). Korakai is listed as a polis in the urban sense in Ps.-Skylax 65 under the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε ; in CID ii 5 . ii . 25 , 36 ( 362 -360 ) the community is listed as a polis in the political sense under the heading ταίδε ταtilde µ πολίων ήνικαν . The external collective use of the cityethnic is found in CID ii 5 . ii . 36 ( 362 -360 ), and the external individual use in CID ii 74 . ii . 30 ( 337 / 6 ). Korakai is possibly to be located at Nevestiki near Lechonia, a hill with a pre-C4fortification and black-glazed pottery (Wace ( 1906 ) 153 -54 ); this site was presumably Thessalian until C4m; a parallel is provided by Iolkos and Pyrasos and by Pagasai and its sanctuary of Apollo Aktios (or Pagasites), situated on the southern shore of the bay of Volos opposite Korope.Pagasai is described as Thessalian by Ps.-Skylax 64 (see further the entry for Pagasai). This part of the Gulf of Pagasai, then, was Thessalian in the Classical period until the arrival of the Magnesians in this part of Thessaly, when it was detached from the Thessalians by Philip II (cf. Pagasai (no. 407 )). The identification is, however, uncertain, and the site has also been identified as that of Magnesian Methone (Masson ( 1968 ) 97 n. 5 ; Barr .). Korakai was a Magnesian community (Ps.-Skylax 65 ), and it sometimes provided the Amphiktyony with one of the Magnesian hieromnemones ( CID ii 32 . 48 (C4l), 74 . i . 39 , ii . 30 ( 337 / 6 ), 76 . i . 25 ( 324 / 4 ), 100 . i . 16 ( 325 / 4 ), 102 . i . 15 ( 324 / 3 )), the other being provided by Homolion (and by Methone or Olizon when Korakai did not provide one). An Archaic inscription ( SEG 17 287 ( c. 550 )) from the possible site of Korakai (see supra ) records building activity, presumably connected with a public construction, and describes a man as δικαστορευacuteΓaltων (see further Masson ( 1968 ) and idem in RPhil 54 ( 1980 ) 226 -27 )."

The city-ethnic is Μελιβοιευacuteς ( IG ii² 9331 (C4m); I.Iasos 54 . 5 (C4l) and on C4f coins ( infra )) or Μελιβοευacuteς (Theopomp. fr. 372 ; Tod 196 . 13 , 37 ( 330 -326 ) and on C4f coins, infra ). Meliboia is called a polis in the territorial sense by Hdt. 7 . 188 . 3 , and in Ps.-Skylax 65 it is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense. It is called a polis in the political sense at Plut. Pel . 29 . 4 (r 367 -366 ). The internal collective use of the cityethnic is attested by C4f coins and on undated tiles stamped ∆η µ [ οσ ] ία Μελιβοιέων (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 50 ); the external individual use is attested by IG ii² 9331 (C4m); I.Iasos 54 . 5 (C4l), and the external collective use by Tod 196 . 13 ( 330 -326 ). During the crisis of 330 -326 Meliboia received 28 , 500 medimnoi of grain from Kyrene (Tod 196 . 13 , 37 ). Meliboia was a polis enspondos of Alexander of Pherai, who nevertheless massacred those attending an ekklesia in 367 -366 (Plut. Pel . 29 . 4 ). A citizen of Meliboia was granted proxeny by Iasos in C4l ( I.Iasos 54 ). Meliboia was a Magnesian city (Ps.-Skylax 65 ) and was probably situated at Kastro Velika near Velika, north of the Agiokambos plain (Tziaphalias ( 1994 a )), a site which remains to be archaeologically investigated. C5 cults are attested for Apollo, Poseidon and Athena ( ArchEph ( 1930 ) 19 nos. 2 -4 ). In C4f, Meliboia minted in both silver and bronze.

In Ps.-Skylax 65 , Methone is the second toponym listed after the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense; in the political sense polis is attested in CID ii 5 . ii . 25 -26 , 39 ( 358 ), where Μάγνητες Μεθωναῖοι ( 39 ) are listed under the heading ταίδε ταtilde µ πολίων ήνικαν ( 25 -26 ) (cf.

A citizen of Methone served the Amphiktyony as tamias ( CID ii 74 . i . 55 ( 337 / 6 )). A collective donation by Methone of 306 dr. towards the rebuilding of the temple at Delphi is recorded in CID ii 5 . ii . 39 ( 358 ).

458,Spalauthra (Spalauthreus),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.1,23.15,269,1325,"458 . Spalauthra (Spalauthreus) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 10 , long. 23 . 15 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Σπάλαυθρα , τά (Ps.-Skylax 65 ; IG ix . 2 1111 . 35 ( c. 130 )); Steph. Byz. 583 . 13 has Σπαλέθρη but cites Hellan. fr. 201 for a form which Jacoby prints as Σπαλάθραν and Meineke ( loc. cit .) as Σπάλαθρον (cf. Meineke's app. crit. ad loc .). The city-ethnic is Σπαλαυθρευacuteς ( IG ix . 2 1111 . 1 ( c. 130 )). Spalauthra is listed as a polis in the urban sense in Ps.Skylax 65 under the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε . The city-ethnic is attested only at a time when the city was a constituency of Demetrias ( IG ix . 2 1111 ( c. 130 )). Spalauthra was a Magnesian city (Ps.-Skylax 65 ). To the south the neighbour was Olizon, to the north-west Korope and Korakai. Although it does not appear in Strabo's account of the synoecism of Demetrias ( 9 . 5 . 15 (r 293 )), it appears as a constituent community of Demetrias in Heltic and later inscriptions ( IG ix . 2 1111 ( c. 130 ); SEG 23 405 (first to second centuries ad )) and so was included in the synoecism at some point. On top of the hill of Chortokastro the church of Ag. Nikolaos presumably stands on the site of an ancient temple (Koder and Hild ( 1976 ) 140 ); if so, this hill was probably the acropolis of Spalauthra. ## 2 . 7 Perrhaibia"
459,Azoros (Azoriastas),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,40.0,22.05,676,3380,"459 . Azoros (Azoriastas) Map 55 . Lat. 40 . 00 , long. 22 . 05 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: C (classified as a fort/tower by Barr ., but see infra ). The toponym is Αacuteζωρος ( Gonnoi 93 .B. 28 (C3l)) or Αζώριον , τό (Polyb. 28 . 13 . 1 ; IG xii . 8 178 .a. 2 (C2 )); Rhianos apud Steph. Byz. 32 . 19 uses Αζώρεια ; Steph. Byz. 32 . 18 states that a plural form was also found ( εν Αζώροις ). The city-ethnic is Αζωριαστάς ( IG ix . 1 689 . 17 (C2e)). No Archaic or Classical source calls Azoros a polis , but it may possibly have been one: according to Livy 42 . 53 . 5 , it was one of the three oppida making up the Perrhaibian Tripolis ( &lt;Perseus&gt; descendit ad Azorum, Pythoum, Dolichen: tripolim vocant incolentes haec tria oppida ), an association for which C4f bronze coins are attested ( infra ). If the name Tripolis means that the constituent communities were poleis , then Azoros was a polis . (See also the entries for Doliche and Pythoion.) Furthermore, the name of the city has been restored at Diod. 19 . 52 . 6 , and this passage uses polis in the urban sense retrospectively in reference to 316 ; Strabo 7 . 7 . 9 uses polis about it retrospectively too, but with no precise indication of date. It is also called polis in a C3l inscription ( Gonnoi 93 .B. 28 ). The city-ethnic is attested only in the Heltic period: the external collective use is found in IG ix . 1 689 . 17 (C2e), and the external individual use in ArchEph ( 1923 ) 144 , 379 .C. 16 (first century ad ). The territory of Azoros to the north bordered on that of Doliche (a fellow member of the Tripolis ), to the east on the territories of Askyris and Oloosson, to the south on that of Malloia, and to the west on that of Mondaia. See the map in Lucas ( 1995 ) 130 . On the territory, see further Lucas ( 1997 ) 149 -51 . Azoros was situated in Perrhaibia (Diod. 19 . 52 . 6 ; Polyb. 28 . 13 . 1 ; IG ix . 1 689 . 5 (C2 )) or Pelagonia (Strabo 7 . 7 . 9 ); Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 . 39 places it in Pelasgiotis. With Pythoion and Doliche, Azoros formed the Perrhaibian Tripolis (Livy 42 . 53 . 5 , quoted supra ; IG xii . 8 178 .a. 2 (C2 ); Strabo 7 . 7 . 9 ; Steph. Byz. 32 . 16 , 637 , s.v. Τρίπολις : καιgrave άλλη Περραιβίας ). Like Doliche and Pythoion-fellow members of the Tripolis -Azoros is absent from the list of Perrhaibian polities in SEG 29 546 ( 375 -350 ); this fact (and the fact that the dispute between Doliche and Eleimiotis was settled by the Makedonian king, Amyntas, see s.v. Doliche) suggests that in C4e the Tripolis was under Makedonian rule (Lucas ( 1997 ) 80 -81 , 211 -16 ). The acropolis was separately walled (Lucas ( 1997 ) 162 -65 ). The preserved remains of the circuit wall are of the later Heltic period (ibid.), but Diod. 19 . 52 . 6 (r 316 ) mentions a siege of Azoros and thus implies the existence of fortifications. There are numerous traces of buildings at Azoros, but in the absence of excavation they cannot be identified (Lucas ( 1997 ) 166 -68 ). A few divinities are known from dedications: Apollo Lykeios (C4 -C3 , unpublished), Apollo Doreios (C3 -C2 , unpublished), Apollo Pythios (Peek ( 1974 ) 7 (C3 -C2 )), and Asklepios (C3f, unpublished), but the patron divinity has not been identified. The Tripolis of Azoros, Pythoion and Doliche struck bronze coins in C4f. Types: obv . Apollo; legend: ΤΡΙΠΟΛΙΤΑΝ ; rev . tripod (Liampi ( 1990 ))."
460,Chyretiai (Chyretiaios),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.5,22.1,255,1266,"460 . Chyretiai (Chyretiaios) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 50 , long. 22 . 10 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: C.The toponym is Χυρετίαι , αιasper (Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 ; ArchEph ( 1917 ) 1 , 301 . 3 (C2e)). The city- ethnic is Χυρετιαῖος ( SEG 29 546 . 10 -11 ( 375 -350 )) or Χυρετιευacuteς ( EAM 40 . 8 = GV i 40 . 8 (C3l/C2e)). NoArchaic or Classical source calls Chyretiai a polis , but two men from the city are listed under the heading Χυρετιαίων in an inscription of 375 -350 which has been interpreted as a catalogue of Perrhaibian polities making a joint dedication to Apollo Pythios at Oloosson and which includes such Perrhaibian communities as Phalanna and Gonnoi ( SEG 29 546 ( 375 -350 )). It is called polis in the political sense in Heltic documents, e.g. ArchEph ( 1917 ) 1 , 301 . 8 ( έδοξε τηsubiotaηtilde Χυρετιέων πόλει ( 191 )). The external individual use of the city-ethnic is found on a C3 tombstone ( EAM 40 . 8 = GVI 40 . 8 (C3l/C2e)). Chyretiai was situated in Perrhaibia ( SEG 29 546 , by implication; see the map in Lucas ( 1995 ) 130 ), though Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 places it in Pelasgiotis. (For C5 coins of the Perrhaibians, see the entry for Oloosson.) Stählin ( 1924 a ) 25 briefly mentions an acropolis wall and traces of an isodomic city wall."
461,Doliche (Dolichaios),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,40.05,22.1,565,2878,"461 . Doliche (Dolichaios) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 05 , long. 22 . 10 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: C. The toponym is ∆ολίχη , ηasper (Polyb. 28 . 13 . 1 ; IG ix . 2 1296 (C1 )); the city-ethnic is ∆ολιχαῖος ( EAM 6 . 2 (C1 )). No Archaic or Classical source calls Doliche a polis , but it may possibly have been one: according to Livy 42 . 53 . 5 , it was one of the three oppida making up the Perrhaibian Tripolis ( &lt;Perseus&gt; descendit ad Azorum, Pythoum, Dolichen: tripolim vocant incolentes haec tria oppida ), an association for which C4f bronze coins are attested ( infra ). If the name Tripolis means that the constituent communities were poleis , then Doliche was a polis . (See also the entries for Azoros and Pythoion). Furthermore, C4f possession of a territory by Doliche is attested by a document dating to the reign of Trajan: the document concerns a territorial conflict between Doliche and the Elimiotes and refers to a similar conflict between the same communities during the reign of Amyntas III ( 390 -371 ), the father of Philip II (Wace and Thompson ( 1910 -11 ) 195 , ll. 16 -18 , 198 ; Lucas ( 1992 ) 132 -34 , ( 1997 ) 148 -49 ). The external individual use of the city-ethnic is found in C1 ( EAM 6 . 2 ). The external collective use of the ethnic may have been used on the stele of Amyntas' arbitration which was set up in the forum at Doliche (l. 13 ) and was pronounced inter Dolichanos et Eleimiotes (ll. 18 -19 ; Wace and Thompson ( 1910 -11 )). Doliche was situated in Perrhaibia (Polyb. 28 . 13 . 1 ; cf. Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 . 39 , who places it in Pelasgiotis). Like Azoros and Pythoion (with whom Doliche formed the Perrhaibian Tripolis ), it is absent from the list of Perrhaibian polities in SEG 29 546 ( 375 -350 ); this fact (and the fact that the dispute between Doliche and Eleimiotis was settled by the Makedonian king, see supra ) suggests that in C4e the Tripolis was under Makedonian rule (Lucas ( 1997 ) 80 -81 , 211 -16 ). T o the south its territory bordered on that of Azoros (a fellow member of the Tripolis ), to the west on that of the Elimiotes, and to the east on that of Pythion (a fellow member of the Tripolis ). See the map in Lucas ( 1995 ) 130 . In C4f Doliche had a territorial conflict with the Elimiotes (Wace and Thompson ( 1910 -11 ); Lucas ( 1992 ) 132 -34 , ( 1997 ) 148 -49 ). The acropolis was separately walled, but the wall, built of quadrangular blocks, has been destroyed by modern constructions (Lucas ( 1997 ) 175 -77 ). Since the publication of Lucas ( 1997 ) new archaeological investigation has ( 1 ) demonstrated the existence of a C4 -C3 city wall, and ( 2 ) unearthed several remains of buildings (possibly the agora); ArchDelt 51 ( 1996 ) 363 -64 . The Tripolis of Azoros, Pythoion and Doliche struck bronze coins in C4f. Types: obv . Apollo; legend: ΤΡΙΠΟΛΙΤΑΝ ; rev . tripod (Liampi ( 1990 ))."

The toponym is probably * Ερεικίνιον reconstructed from Latin Ericinium (Livy 36 . 13 . 6 ) and the city-ethnic ' Ερεικινευacuteς ( SEG 29 546 ; cf. 33 457 ( 375 -350 )) or ' Ερικινευacuteς ( CID ii 9 . 4 (C4m)). No Archaic or Classical source calls *Ereikinion a polis , but in the Delphic naopoioi 's accounts the ' Ερικινεῖς are recorded in a fragmentary list ( CID ii 9 . 4 ), the heading of which undoubtedly included the formula ταίδε ταtilde µ πολίων ήνικαν ( CID ii 5 . ii . 25 -26 ) vel sim . Furthermore, two men from the city are listed under the heading ' Ερεικινείων in an inscription of 375 -350 which has been interpreted as a catalogue of Perrhaibian polities making a dedication to Apollo Pythios at Oloosson and includes such Perrhaibian communities as Phalanna and Gonnoi ( SEG 29 546 ). Furthermore, CID ii 9 . 4 (C4m) records a donation by the ' Ερεικινεῖς . A C2 inscription attests the external individual use of the city-ethnic ( Gonnoi 42 ). *Ereikinion was situated near the village of MegaEleftherochori (formerly Kebir); cf. Lucas ( 1995 ). It was a Perrhaibian city ( CID ii 9 . 4 (C4m); see the map in Lucas ( 1995 ) 130 ) and is listed in SEG 29 546 ( 375 -350 ). (For C5 coins of the Perrhaibians, see the entry for Oloosson.)"
463,Gonnos (Gonneus),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.5,22.3,661,3139,"463 . Gonnos (Gonneus) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 50 , long. 22 . 30 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: A. The toponym is Γόννος , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 128 . 1 ; Eust. Il . 2 . 739 ) or Γόννοι ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 39 ( 230 -220 )). The city-ethnic is Γοννευacuteς (C4 coins, infra ; SEG 29 546 . 16 ( 375 -350 ); cf. 33 457 ); Steph. Byz. 211 . 3 gives Γονατάς and Γόννιος , both unattested. Gonnos is called polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 7 . 128 . 1 , 173 . 4 ; polis in the political sense occurs in SEG 35 566 ( c. 300 ) and frequently in Heltic decrees of the city, e.g. Gonnoi 2 . 8 (C3e), which also has [politai] (l. 9 ). Patris is found in Gonnoi 211 (C3 ). The internal collective use of the cityethnic is found on C4 coins ( infra ) and in, e.g., Gonnoi 1 . 3 (C4l/C3e). The external collective use is attested in SEG 29 546 . 16 ( 375 -350 ) and IG iv 617 . 13 ([ Γον ] νεῖς (C4l)). At Hdt. 5 . 63 . 3 , the transmitted Κονιαῖος is sometimes emended to Γονναῖος (e.g. How and Wells ( 1928 ) ad loc .), but see Helly ( 1995 ) 103 . The external individual use is found in IG ii² 1132 . 66 ( c. 278 ). Gonnos was situated in Perrhaibia (Hdt. 7 . 128 . 1 , 173 . 4 ; IG ii² 1132 . 66 ( 130 / 29 )), and is recorded in SEG 29546 ( 375 -350 ), a list of Perrhaibian polities making a joint dedication to Apollo Pythios at Oloosson.(For C5 coins of the Perrhaibians, see the entry for Oloosson.) On military matters, all evidence is Heltic (see Helly ( 1973 ) 145 -46 ); evidence on the political organisation is likewise Heltic (Helly ( 1973 ) 138 -45 ). Gonnoi 1 (C4l/C3e) is a grant of proxeny to a man from Larisa. Gonnoi 5 (C3 ) combines proxeny with enktesis , epinomia , etc. IG iv 617 . 13 ( 316 -293 ) records a monetary donation by Gonnos 'to the θεωροί sent out from Argos to announce the celebration of the Nemean Games and the Heraia' (Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 , 127 -29 ). Situated on the end of a ridge on the lower slopes of Mt. Olympos, the city of Gonnos was centred on three hills, the northernmost of which formed the acropolis with a temple of Athena Polias constructed 650 -600 (Helly ( 1973 ) 72 with map i); in this sanctuary public documents were published; it was restored in C4l (ibid. 95 ). The acropolis was separately walled, possibly from the Archaic period ( PECS 359 ). In the Heltic period ( PECS 360 ) the city was protected by a fortification wall (for which see Helly ( 1973 ) 23 -28 with map i) which incorporated all three hills in the fortified area. The area enclosed measured c. 6 ha. For two Classical second-order sites in the territory, see Helly ( 1973 ) 39 -47 . Gonnoi 147 (C3 ?) attests to a cult of Athena Polias and SEG 35 567 ( c. 300 ) to one of Athena Patroia; Gonnoi 158 (C4f) is a dedication to Apollo Pythios, and Gonnoi 162 (C4l/C3e) is one to Artemis. Asklepios is attested by SEG 35 565 (C4 ) and Gonnoi 199 (C3 ), Ennodia by Gonnoi 201 (C3 ) and Herakles by 202 (C3 ). Gonnos struck bronze coins in C4 . Types: Obv . female head (nymph?) in border of dots; rev . lion standing; legend: ΓΟΝΝΕ , ΓΟΝΝΕΩΝ (Rogers ( 1932 ) 79 -80 nos. 223 -26 ; Helly ( 1973 ) 155 ; SNG Cop.Thessaly 53 -54 )."

Type: C (classified as a fort/tower by Barr ., but see infra ). The toponym is not recorded in Greek sources, but is given as Malloea by Livy 31 . 41 , 36 . 10 , etc., which with the city-ethnic ( infra ) suggests Μαλλοία , ηasper . The city-ethnic is Μαλλοιάτας ( SEG 29 546 . 13 ( 375 -350 )). No Archaic or Classical source calls Malloia a polis , but two men from the city are listed under the heading Μαλλοιαταtildeν in an inscription of 375 -350 which has been interpreted as a catalogue of Perrhaibian polities making a dedication to Apollo and which includes such Perrhaibian communities as Phalanna and Gonnoi ( SEG 29 546 ); note also SEG 35 636 (C5s), an epitaph that uses άρχων about the deceased, which presumably indicates that he died while in office and suggests the existence of magistracies at Malloia. Malloia was a Perrhaibian city (Livy 31 . 41 , 36 . 10 , etc.) situated at the site of Margara north-west of the village of Palaiokastro (Lucas ( 1995 ) 124 and map at 130 ). It is recorded in SEG 29 546 ( 375 -350 ), a list of Perrhaibian polities making a joint dedication to Apollo Pythios at Oloosson. A circuit wall is visible at the site, but the city remains to be investigated archaeologically. (For C5 coins of the Perrhaibians, see the entry for Oloosson.)"
465,Mondaia (Mondaieus),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,40.0,21.55,462,2314,"465 . Mondaia (Mondaieus) Map 55 . Lat. 40 . 00 , long. 21 . 55 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: B. The toponym is Μονδαία ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) v .C(b). 6 ( 230 -220 ); cf. infra ). The cityethnic Μονδαιάτας was originally restored in SEG 29 546 . 14 ( Μονδα [ ιαταtilde ] ν ), and this form is found also in Syll . ² 793 (presumably C3e); however,Knoepfler has suggested restoring Μονδαιευacuteς ( Μονδα [ ιείω ] ν ; cf. SEG 33 457 ), a form also found in C4s ( BE ( 1994 ) 111 ); apart from Syll . ² 793 (presumably C3e), later sources invariably have Μονδαιευacuteς ( IG ix . 1 689 . 9 ; Gonnoi 69 . 6 (both C2e)). No Archaic or Classical source calls Mondaia a polis , but two men from the city are listed under the heading Μονδα [ ιαταtilde ] ν vel Μονδα [ ιειῶ ] ν in an inscription of 375 -350 which has been interpreted as a catalogue of Perrhaibian polities making a joint dedication to Apollo Pythios at Oloosson and which includes such Perrhaibian communities as Phalanna and Gonnoi ( SEG 29 546 ). Mondaia is called a polis in the political sense in Gonnoi 69 . 7 ( 178 ) while Syll . ² 793 (presumably C3e) terms the community Μον [ δ ] αιαταtildeν τοgrave κοινόν . The external collective use of the city-ethnic occurs on C4s stamped tiles found in Pella ( BE ( 1994 ) 111 ), as well as in SEG 29 546 ( 375 -350 ). In 230 -220 a citizen of Mondaia may have served as Delphic theorodokos ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) v .C(b). 6 ), but certainty is impossible, since the first letter is illegible, which means that [K]ondaia , a city of the Larisaian plain,is also a possible reading (Lucas ( 1997 ) 87 ). Mondaia was a Perrhaibian city and is recorded in SEG 29 546 ( 375 -350 ), a list of Perrhaibian polities making a joint dedication to Apollo Pythios. It was situated at the site of Kastri, east of the village of Loutro Elassonas (Lucas ( 1997 ) 155 , 199 -201 with map at 130 ). At the site, remains of walls are visible on the acropolis and in the lower city; on the acropolis are remains of fine buildings as well (autopsy by G.Lucas). The patron divinity was presumably Themis, in whose sanctuary documents were published ( Gonnoi 69 ; cf. Syll . ² 793 ). Syll . ² 793 (presumably C3e) records a consultation by Mondaia of the oracle at Dodona. (For C5 coins of the Perrhaibians, see the entry for Oloosson.)"

Type: C (classified as a fort/tower by Barr ., but see infra ). The toponym is Μυλαί , αιasper ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 134 ( 230 -220 ); Steph. Byz. 461 . 9 ). The city-ethnic is Μυλαῖος ( SEG 29 546 . 9 ( 375 -350 )). No Archaic or Classical source calls Mylai a polis , but three men from the city are listed under the heading Μυλαίων in an inscription of 375 -350 which has been interpreted as a catalogue of Perrhaibian polities making a joint dedication to Apollo Pythios at Oloosson and which includes such Perrhaibian communities as Phalanna and Gonnoi ( SEG 29546 ). In 230 -220 , a citizen of Mylai served as Delphic theorodokos ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 134 ). Mylai was a Perrhaibian city, and it is recorded in SEG 29 546 ( 375 -350 ), a list of Perrhaibian polities making a joint dedication to Apollo Pythios. (For C5 coins of the Perrhaibians, see the entry for Oloosson). Mylai was situated at Kastri, north of the village of Vlachogianni (Lucas ( 1995 ) 122 ). To the north its territory bordered on that of Malloia,to the north-west on that of Chyretiai,to the southeast on that of Phalanna, to the south on that of Erikinion, and to the west on the territories of Phakion and Oxyneia. See the map at Lucas ( 1995 ) 130 . The acropolis of Mylai was enclosed by a wall; it runs for c. 400 m and is constructed in large irregular blocks which do not join; there may have been an entrance in the south-east, and gates or sally-ports were possibly located to the south and north-west; and a ruined square tower (possibly Heltic) was found on the highest point of the wall (autopsy by G. Lucas). To the north a wall is seen descending towards the city wall, though no trace of the latter has been found (autopsy by G. Lucas). In the centre of the acropolis are the foundations of a rectangular building; and there are numerous traces of habitation to the west, north-west and south-west (autopsy by G.Lucas)."
467,Oloosson (Oloossonios),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,39.55,22.2,600,3125,"467 . Oloosson (Oloossonios) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 55 , long. 22 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: B. The toponym is ' Ολοοσσών , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 739 ; Eust. Il . 520 . 25 ), ' Ολόσσων ( Gonnoi 93 .B. 23 (C3l); Strabo 9 . 5 . 19 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ολοσσόνιος ( Gonnoi 11 . 3 (C3f), and presumably C4 coins ( infra )). NoArchaic or Classical source calls Oloosson a polis , but it is included as a probable polis here because ( 1 ) it struck coins in C4 , and ( 2 ) it is highly likely that [ ' Ολοσσονίον (gen.pl.)] should be restored in SEG 29 546 . 4 , an inscription of 375 -350 found at Oloosson which has been interpreted as a catalogue of Perrhaibian polities making a dedication to Apollo Pythios and which includes such Perrhaibian communities as Phalanna and Gonnoi.Oloosoon is called a polis in the political sense in Gonnoi 18 . 14 (C3l). The internal collective city-ethnic is abbreviated on C4 coins ( infra ) and has been restored at SEG 29 546 . 4 ( 375 -350 ). The external individual use is found in Gonnoi 11 . 3 and SEG 23 455 (both C3f). In C3s Gonnoi conferred proxenia and other privileges upon two citizens of Oloosson ( Gonnoi 11 , 18 ). Oloosson was Perrhaibian (Strabo 9 . 5 . 19 ; though Steph. Byz. 490 . 11 places it in Magnesia, presumably confusing it with Magnesian Olizon, which at 489 . 14 he places in Thessalia).It was situated at modern Elasson,and in 375 -350 it was probably listed in SEG 29 546 (cf. app. crit.), a list found at Oloosson itself and cataloguing Perrhaibian polities making a joint dedication to Apollo Pythios at Oloosson. Oloosson was presumably a leading city of the Perrhaibian ethnos if the hypothesis that the C5silver coinage of the Perrhaibians ( infra ) was struck by Oloosson is accepted (Babelon, Traité ii. 4 327 -28 ; Liampi ( 1996 ) 119 ); for the similarities between these coins and contemporary coins of Krannon, Larisa, Pharkadon, Trikka, Pherai and Skotoussa, see Kraay ( 1976 ) 115 -16 and Martin ( 1985 ) 36 -37 . An unpublished inscription (C3s) mentions a sanctuary of Asklepios, and on the basis of coin types a cult of Zeus may be assumed as well. SEG 29 546 , a joint dedication to Apollo Pythios by the Perrhaibian polities, was found in Oloosson. On the northern slope of the acropolis traces of an isodomic wall are visible (Stählin ( 1924 a ) 24 ). The C5silver and C4 bronze coinage of the Perrhaibians was probably struck by Oloosson (Babelon, Traité ii. 4 327 -28 ): ( 1 ) Silver, denominations: drachm, triobol, trihemiobol, obol and hemiobol on the Aiginetan standard; types: obv . young man restraining a bull, or forepart of bull, or horseman, or galloping horse, or head of Athena; rev . galloping horse, or forepart of horse, or Athena running, or horse's head; legend: ΠΕ or ΠΕΡΑ . ( 2 ) Bronze: obv . veiled Hera facing; rev . Zeus; legend: ( Π ) ΕΡΡΑΙΒΩΝ (Head, HN ² 304 ; Rogers ( 1932 ) nos. 437 -39 ; Gardner ( 1963 ) 39 ; Liampi ( 1996 ) 109 -10 ; SNG Cop. Thessaly 193 -97 ). In C4 Oloosson struck its own bronze coins: obv . horseman; rev . Zeus brandishing thunderbolt; legend: ΟΛΟΣΣΟΝ ( ΙΩΝ ) (Lavva ( 1994 ))."

The toponym is Φαλάννα , ηasper in SEG 38 649 (C4 ) (cf.Voutiras ( 1991 )); BCH 45 ( 1921 ) v . 43 ( 230 -220 ); and Strabo 9 . 5 . 19 . According to Steph. Byz. 655 . 20 , Ephoros ( = FGrHist 70 ) fr. 62 used the toponym Φάλλανος (cf. Eust. Il . 520 . 18 : ηasper Φάλλανος ). Hecat. fr. 5 is quoted by Steph. Byz. 655 . 19 for the variant name ' Ιππία , which is taken by Jacoby ( ad loc .) to be a variant name not of the city, but of the eponymous heroine Phalanna.According to Strabo 9 . 5 . 15 , 'some' ( τινές ) used the toponym /acuteΟρθη (cf. Hom. Il . 2 . 739 ) about the acropolis of Phalanna, whereas Ael. Herod. De pros. cath . 3 . 1 , 321 . 5 takes /acuteΟρθη to be a πόλις Περραιβίας ηgrave Θετταλίας , καλου µ ένη , φασί , καιgrave Κορσέα . However,according to Eust. Il . 1 . 520 . 28 , Korsea was another name for the acropolis. The city-ethnic was Φαλανναῖος (C4 coins, infra ; SEG 29 546 . 6 ( 375 -350 ); CID ii 32 . 45 (C4l)); an inscription from Argos uses Φαλαννευacuteς ( IG iv 617 . 12 ( 316 -293 )). No Archaic or Classical source explicitly describes Phallana as a polis ; but the political sense is indirectly attested in the Delphic accounts of 337 / 6 ( CID ii 74 ), where a tamias of Phalanna is recorded ( i . 48 ) after the heading τοgraveν τα µ ίαν αποπέ µ πειν ταgraveς πόλεις ( i . 4 ). For an explicit attestation,see ArchEph ( 1916 ) 18 , 272 , 1 (C3e); IG ix . 21228 .a 13 , b 17 (C3 ) has πολιτεία in ll. 17 -18 . The term αστός ( = Γaltασστός ) in the sense of 'citizen' is found in a C5law ( IG ix . 2 1226 .a 3 ) which describes itself as a νό µ ος (a 1 ) and refers to κοιναgrave χ [ ρ ] έ µ ατα (a 6 -7 ). Phalanna is described as πατρίς in SEG 38 649 (C4 ); cf. V outiras ( 1991 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4 coins ( infra ) and in ArchEph ( 1916 ) 18 , 272 , 1 (C3e). The external collective use is found in SEG 29 546 . 6 ( 375 -350 ) and IG iv 617 . 12 ( 316 -293 ), an inscription recording a collective donation of money by the Phalannians (see further Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 , 127 -29 ). The external individual use is found in CID ii 32 . 45 (C4l), 74 . i . 48 ( 337 / 6 ), 77 . i . 9 ( 334 / 3 ), 96 . 7 ( 327 / 6 ), 100 . i . 9 ( 325 / 4 ), 102 . i . 10 ( 324 / 3 ). Phalanna was a Perrhaibian city ( CID ii 77 . i . 9 , 96 . 7 ), and it is listed in SEG 29 546 ( 375 -350 ), a list of Perrhaibian polities making a joint dedication to Apollo Pythios at Oloosson. (For C5 coins of the Perrhaibians, see the entry for Oloosson.) It was probably situated at Damasi (Lucas ( 1995 ) 122 with map at 130 ). Citizens of Phalanna served the Amphiktyonic League on behalf of the Perrhaibians as hieromnemones ( CID ii 32 . 45 (C4l), 96 . 7 ( 327 / 6 ), 100 . i . 9 ( 325 / 4 ), 102 . i . 10 ( 324 / 3 )) and as tamiai ( CID ii 74 . i . 9 ( 337 / 6 ), 77 . 9 ( 334 / 3 )). With the other Perrhaibian communities, Phalanna in 375 -350 made a dedication to Apollo Pythios at Oloosson ( SEG 29 546 ). IG iv 617 . 4 ( 316 -293 ) records a monetary donation by Phalanna 'to the θεωροί sent out from Argos to announce the celebration of the Nemean Games and the Heraia' (Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 , 127 -29 ). In 230 -220 a citizen of Phalanna served as Delphic theorodokos ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) v . 43 ). The earliest public enactment is a C5law ( νό µ ος ) concerning public finances ( IG ix . 2 1226 ). Heltic inscriptions refer to several officials ( ArchEph ( 1916 ) 18 , 272 , 1 (C3e); IG ix . 2 1233 (C3 )). A theatre is mentioned in a C2 inscription ( IG ix . 2 1230 ), and recent explorations have revealed traces of a polygonal wall on the acropolis (autopsy by G. Lucas), but apart from that there is no evidence for the urban centre. Phalanna minted in both silver and bronze in C4 . ( 1 ) Silver, denominations: drachms, triobols, trihemiobols, obols on the Aiginetan standard; types: obv . young man with short hair (Ares?), or Hekate holding two torches seated on lion (beneath ΠΟ ); rev . bridled horse, or hunter with dog; legend: ΦΑΛΑΝΝΑΙΩΝ .

469,Pythoion (Pythoiastas),Thessalia and Adjacent Regions,40.05,22.15,612,3105,"469 . Pythoion (Pythoiastas) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 05 , long. 22 . 15 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: C. The toponym is Πυacuteθοιον , τό ( IG iv² . 1 94 .b. ii . 39 (post-316 )) or Πυacuteθειον ( F.Delphes iii . 4 417 . iii . 5 ( c. 257 / 3 )); Πυacuteθιον is found in late literary sources (Plut. Aem . 15 . 2 ; Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 . 39 ). The city-ethnic is Πυθοιάστας , but attested only in the Heltic period ( SEG 36 554 . 4 (C2f)). NoArchaic or Classical source calls Pythoion a polis , but it may possibly have been one: according to Livy 42 . 53 . 5 , it was one of the three oppida making up the Perrhaibian Tripolis ( &lt;Perseus&gt; descendit ad Azorum, Pythoum, Dolichen: tripolim vocant incolentes haec tria oppida ), an association for which C4f bronze coins are attested ( infra ). If the name Tripolis means that the constituent communities were poleis , then Pythoion was a polis . Furthermore, in C4l a citizen of Pythoion served as Epidaurian theorodokos ( IG iv² . 1 94 i .b. 39 ). Pythoion calls itself ηasper πόλις ηasper Πυθοιαστῶν in a C2f proxeny decree ( SEG 36 552 . 4 ). A coin inscribed ΠΥΘΙΑΤΩΝ is a forgery (Lucas ( 1997 ) 77 ). Pythoion was situated on the hill of Ag. Apostoli south of the present village of Pythion, formerly Selos (Lucas ( 1997 ) 182 -85 ). Though geographically located in Perrhaibia (Plut. Aem. 15 . 2 ), Pythoion (like Azoros and Doliche,with which it formed the Perrhaibian Tripolis ) is absent from the list of Perrhaibian polities in SEG 29 546 ( 375 -350 ; cf. Lucas ( 1997 ) 80 -81 ); this fact (and the fact that the dispute between Doliche and Eleimiotis was settled by the Makedonian king, s.v. Doliche) suggests that in C4e the Tripolis was under Makedonian rule (Lucas ( 1997 ) 80 -81 , 211 -16 ). In addition, the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi ( IG iv² . 1 94 I.b. 39 (post-316 )) seems to record Pythoion in the Makedonian section (Lucas ( 1997 ) 81 -82 ), and F.Delphes iii . 4 417 . iii . 5 ( c. 257 -253 ) is a grant of proxeny to a man described as Μακεδωgraveν ' Ε [ λ ] ει µ ιώτ [ ης ] εκ Πυθείου ; Steph. Byz. 538 . 21 also locates it in Makedonia; another passage of Steph. Byz. ( 157 . 12 -13 ) possibly attests to the settlement of Makedonians in Pythoion in C4 -C3 : Θεαγένης εν ΜακεδονίΩsubiotaα ' Βαλλαίους µ εταγαγωgraveν εις τοgraveν νυtildeν λεγό µ ενον Πυacuteθιον τόπον '(see Lucas ( 1997 ) 76 , 216 ). A temple of Apollo Pythios, the patron divinity, is mentioned in a C2m inscription ( SEG 36 552 ; cf. Plut. Aem . 15 . 10 ), and recent excavations have unearthed two temples of Roman date ( ArchDelt 51 ([ 1996 ] 2001 ) 364 ). The acropolis was surrounded by a wall constructed in small flat stones (Lucas ( 1997 ) 183 -84 ). A wall surrounding the lower city, probably isodomic to judge from the visible remains,has recently been located, but is as yet unpublished and undated. To the south and south-west are numerous traces of occupation (ibid. 184 ). The Tripolis of Azoros, Pythoion and Doliche struck bronze coins in C4f. Types: obv . Apollo; legend: ΤΡΙΠΟΛΙΤΑΝ ; rev . tripod (Liampi ( 1990 )). ## 2 . 8 Athamania"

The Poleis A morgos (A morgios ) Map 61 . Lat. 36 . 50 , long. 25 . 55 . Size of island: 124 km ² . The toponym is Α µ οργός , ηasper (Thuc. 8 . 28 . 5 ; IG xii . 7 69 . 23 (C4l-C3e)). The ethnic is Α µ όργιος ( IG ii² 43 .B 28 ; Ath. 480 D: Σι µ ωνίδης οasper Α µ όργιος ). The alternative forms Α µ οργῖνος and Α µ οργίτης are attested only in late sources ( Suda Σ 446 ; Steph. Byz. 86 . 12 -13 ). Stephanos 86 . 9 makes the island one of the Kyklades. Amorgos was divided among three poleis (Ps.-Skylax 58 : τρίπολις ; IG xii . 7 68 . 1 -2 = Migeotte ( 1984 ) 189 -92 no. 54 (C4l/C3e): ηasper πόλις [ ηasper Αρκεσι ] νέων καιgrave ηasper πόλις ηasper Αιγιαλέων καιgrave [ ηasper πό ] λις ηasper Μινοητῶν ). They were allegedly founded by the poet Semonides as a Samian colony more than 400 years after the Trojan War (( FGrHist 534 ) T 1 a-b). The view that the three Amorgian poleis were Samian colonies may derive some support from the names of the months (Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 116 -17 n. 2 ). They paid tribute to the Athenians in C5 as a synteleia ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 10 , 279 . ii . 80 , 280 . ii . 73 , 281 . iii . 58 , 282 . ii . 41 ) and were united once again in joining the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 .B 28 ). An Aristotelian Constitution of the Amorgians is attested (Heracl. Lemb. 47 ). The collective use of the ethnic is attested internally on coins: ΑΜΟ (Head, HN ² 481 (C4 )) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists and on the stele listing the members of the Second Athenian Naval League ( supra ). The individual ethnic is used externally on Delos in 364 / 3 ( Α µ οργίη , I.Délos 104 . 72 ) and in Eretria c. 300 ( Α µ όργιος , IG xii . 9 799 ). Thus, persons from the island were often regarded as simply Amorgioi, regardless of their polis of origin or the precise political situation of the island. Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 116 -19 argues that the three poleis used the same calendar, but the evidence for several months is Heltic (Trümpy, Monat . 73 -78 ). It is clear that the poleis of Amorgos combined for various purposes in C5 and C4 , especially when dealing with outside powers. But there is ample evidence that on land the poleis retained their individual identities. For the political institutions of the poleis , with reservations, see Ruppel ( 1927 ) 313 -19 . Amorgos struck bronze coins in C4s. Types: obv . star and crescent, or head of Asklepios, or cupping vessel; rev . two thyrsoi crossed, or bee; legend: ΑΜΟ (Head, HN ² 481 )."
471,Aigiale (Aigialeus),The Aegean,36.55,26.0,306,1460,"471 . Aigiale (Aigialeus) Map 61 . Lat. 36 . 55 , long. 26 . 00 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Αιγιάλη , ηasper ( IG xii . 7 515 . 56 (C2 )), but Αιγιαλός /-όν , οasper / τό is also reported ( IG xii . 7 388 . 35 = Migeotte ( 1984 ) 196 -98 no. 56 (C2 )). According to Steph. Byz. 121 . 2 , an alternative toponym was Μελανία . The city-ethnic is Αιγιαλευacuteς ( IG xii . 7 68 . 1 (C4 /C3 )).Aigiale is referred to as a polis in the urban sense by the term τρίπολις at Ps.-Skylax 58 , and is called polis in the political sense in IG xii . 7 68 . 1 (C4 /C3 ), where the internal and collective sense of the city-ethnic is used. The external use seems to be unattested until C2l, when the collective use is found in an inscription of Magnesia ( Syll . ³ 562 . 83 ). Aigiale was situated at the eastern end of Amorgos; there are walls of Archaic or Classical date, and sherds testify to occupation until C4l (Leekley and Noyes ( 1975 ) 40 ). The territory of Aigiale bordered on that of Minoa (no. 573 ). In light of the limited archaeological work in the Amorgian countryside, nothing can be said with confidence about the extent of the territory, but it seems to have been larger than 25 km ² . The protective divinity of Aigiale was Athena Polias, who had a sanctuary where stelai were sometimes erected ( IG xii . 7 386 . 42 = Syll . ³ 521 (C3 )); she is once attested as sharing a sanctuary with Zeus Polieus ( IG xii . 7 387 . 23 (C3 ))."

The toponym is Αρκεσίνη , ηasper ( IG xii . 7 53 . 38 (C1 )) or Αρκεσίνα ( IG xii . 7 50 . 2 (C2 )). Steph. Byz. 121 . 2 -3 quotes Polybios as regarding it as masculine (fr. 20 ). The city-ethnic is Αρκεσινευacuteς ( IG xii . 7 5 . 2 , 22 . 10 (C4m)). Arkesine is referred to as a polis in the urban sense by the term τρίπολις at Ps.-Skylax 58 (cf. IG xii suppl. 330 (C2 )) and is called polis in the political sense in IG xii . 7 5 . 4 , 6 , 7 -8 , 10 , 12 , 22 . The collective use of the city-ethnic appears internally in C4 decrees ( IG xii . 7 5 . 2 ). Arkesine was situated toward the western end of Amorgos, and its territory bordered on that of Minoa (no. 473 ). The size of the territory was between 25 and 100 km ² . The eponymous official was an archon serving as chief of a board of archons ( IG xii suppl. 331 (C4 ); IG xii . 7 55 = Syll . ³ 1200 (C4 /C3 ); Sherk ( 1990 ) 262 ). Of other officials the most important is a strategos ( IG xii . 7 69 . 47 (C4l/C3e)). Laws and decrees ( IG xii . 7 69 . 47 (C4l/C3e)) were proposed in accordance with a probouleumatic procedure ( IG xii . 7 46 + add (C4 )) and passed by a boule and a demos ( IG xii . 7 1 . 1 (C5 ), 2 . 1 (C4 )) presided over by a board of prytaneis ( IG xii . 7 3 . 37 , 4 . 6 (C4 )). A number of honorific decrees of C4 or C4lC3e grant proxenia to citizens of Athens (no. 361 ), Thera (no. 527 ), Rhithymnos (no. 987 ) and Rhodos (no. 1000 ) ( IG xii . 7 5 -11 ). Public enactments were stored in an archive ( δη µ όσιον ) and in the sanctuary of Hera ( IG xii . 7 67 . 83 (C4l/C3e)). Trials were brought before an official called εσαγωγευacuteς ( IG xii . 7 3 . 39 , 42 (C4f)) and heard by a dikasterion situated in the urban centre ( τοgrave αστικοgraveν δικαστήριον ) ( IG xii . 7 3 . 32 , 49 -50 ). The protective deity is not known. The cults of Athena Itonia were very important in the Heltic period ( IG xii . 7 22 -23 , 33 -35 ), but in the Classical period the cult may have been that of Hera ( IG xii . 7 1 , 2 ), in whose sanctuary public enactments were kept ( IG xii . 7 30 . 5 -8 (C3l/C2e), 67 . 83 (C4l/C3e), 69 . 52 (C4l/C3e)); a public law forbidding access to foreigners is preserved ( IG xii . 7 2 (C4 ); cf. Butz ( 1996 ) 86 -88 ). The acropolis of Arkesine was called Aspis ( IG xii . 7 57 . 5 (C3 )). Four months of the calendar, in order, are known from C4 : Eiraphion, Anthesterion, Taureion and Thargelion ( IG xii . 7 62 . 28 , 9 , 10 , 4 , 49 ; Trümpy, Monat . 73 -77 ). The fortification walls are probably Heltic (Rougemont et al . ( 1993 ) 104 -12 ) but may go back to C4s (Brun ( 1996 ) 151 )."

The toponym is ΜινΩsubiotaώα , ηasper ( IG xii . 7 228 . 10 (C2 )). The city-ethnic is Μινοήτης ( IG xii . 7 68 . 2 = Migeotte ( 1984 ) 189 -92 no. 54 (C4 /C3 )) or Μινωήτης ( IG xii . 7 223 . 6 (C2 )) or Μινωίτης (Androtion ( FGrHist 324 ) fr. 22 ). Minoa is referred to as a polis in the urban sense by the term τρίπολις at Ps.-Skylax 58 and is called polis in the political sense in IG xii . 7 68 . 2 (C4 /C3 ), where the collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested. The external use is attested collectively in Androtion ( FGrHist 324 fr. 22 ) and individually in a C3 proxeny decree from Tenos ( IG xii . 5 821 . 3 ). A board of prytaneis is attested in a citizenship decree of C5 -C4 ( IG xii . 7 219 ). A cult of Apollo Pythios (or possibly Delios), who may have been the protective deity, is known from a sacred nomos of C5 -C4 ( IG xii . 7 220 ). The urban centre was walled starting in the Geometric period (Marangou ( 1990 )). The walls enclosed an area of c. 20 ha. A separately walled acropolis inside the polis covered an area of c. 4 . 5 ha. ( AR 47 ( 2000 -2001 ) 122 ). There are remains of a C4 gymnasium (Marangou ( 1987 ) 255 )."
474,Anaphe (Anaphaios),The Aegean,36.2,25.45,693,3233,"474 . Anaphe (Anaphaios) Map 61 . Lat. 36 . 20 , long. 25 . 45 . Size of territory: 2 ( 40 km ² ). Type: B. The toponym is Ανάφη , ηasper (Ap. Rhod. 4 . 1717 ; Ath. 400 Ε = Hegesandros ( FHG iv 421 ) (C3 )). The city-ethnic is Αναφαῖος ( IG i³ 71 . i . 85 ; IG xii . 3 251 ) or Αναφαιευacuteς ( IG i³ 283 . ii . 31 ). The earliest explicit attestation of Anaphe as a polis is in a decree of C2 ( IG xii . 3 248 ), but the island's status as a polis is strongly indicated by membership of the Delian League combined with the C4 network of proxenoi in other poleis ( infra ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in C4lists of proxenoi ( IG xii . 3 250 . 15 , 251 passim ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( supra ). The individual and external use is attested in a C3m citizenship decree from Kalymna ( Tit. Cal . 41 . 2 ). Strabo classes Anaphe among the islands in the Cretan Sea ( 10 . 5 . 1 ), but Ap. Rhod. Argon . 4 . 1711 and 1717 and Steph. Byz. 93 . 10 among the Sporades.The territory of Anaphe was coterminous with the island. Anaphe was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Island district ( IG i³ 287 . i . 9 ) and is recorded three times in the tribute lists, in 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 . ii . 31 ), in 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . i . 9 ) and in 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 9 ), paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 283 . ii . 31 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 85 ) ( 1 , 000 dr.). It has been suggested that the island was brought into the League only in 428 / 7 by Lysikles (Thuc. 3 . 19 . 2 ; Mattingly ( 1996 ) 77 with n. 27 ), and also to restore Anaphe as a member of the Second Athenian Naval League (Accame ( 1941 ) 79 and 82 at IG ii² 43 . 86 , but see Cargill ( 1981 ) 35 ). Three fragmentary inscriptions contain lists of proxenoi of Anaphe. The two first are of C4 and record proxenoi in Olynthos (no. 588 ), Thessalian Pharsalos (no. 413 ), Mykonos (no. 506 ), Knidos (no. 903 ), Paros (no. 509 ), Chios (no. 840 ) and Telemessos (no. 936 ) ( IG xii . 3 250 -51 ). The protective deity was Apollo Asgelatas-by lapsus Agelatos on the map-( IG xii . 3 248 . 8 (C2 )), or Aigletes (Callim. fr. 7 . 19 , etc.), whose sanctuary was located a few kilometres east of the polis centre and was connected to the polis centre by a sacred way (Hiller von Gaertringen ( 1899 -1909 ) i. 352 -53 ). The sanctuary and the cult are attested in dedications of the Classical period ( IG xii . 3 256 (C4 or C3 ), 257 (C4 ), 258 (C4 /C3 ). The polis centre had temples of Apollo Pythios and Artemis Soteira ( IG xii . 3 . 268 -71 (Hell.)); there was also a sanctuary for Asklepios ( IG xii . 3 248 . 29 ). Remains of fortification walls and harbour are probably Heltic (Hiller von Gaertringen ( 1899 -1909 ) i. 351 -58 ). For an updated description of the archaeological remains and especially the fortification walls, see Matthaiou and Pikoulas ( 1990 -91 ). Some anepigraphic coins on the Milesian-Phoenician standard have been dated to C5e and assigned to Anaphe. Denominations: half-stater and quarter-stater. Types: obv . amphora; rev . four-part incuse square. The attribution to Anaphe is not secure (Erxleben ( 1970 ) 69 -70 ; Figueira ( 1998 ) 577 )."

The city-ethnic is Αacuteνδριος (Pl. Ion 541 D; IG ii² 123 . 9 ). Hdt. 5 . 31 . 2 classes Andros among the Kyklades; cf. Strabo 10 . 5 . 3 . Andros is called a polis both in the urban sense (Xen. Hell . 1 . 4 . 22 ; Ps.-Skylax 58 ) and in the political sense (Hdt. 4 . 33 . 2 ; Arist. Pol . 1270 b 12 -13 ; SEG 12 390 . 6 , 31 , 44 ( c. 320 ); for the date see SEG 30 1070 ). The territory, which was coterminous with the island itself, is called ηasper Ανδρία χώρα by Xenophon ( Hell . 1 . 4 . 22 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic appears externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ) and on Delos in 377 / 6 ( I.Délos 98 .B. 9 -10 ). Internally its first appearance is in a decree of C4f ( IG xii suppl. 245 . 3 ). The individual and external use is attested in Athens in C5s ( IG i³ 1342 -43 ; Pl. Ion 541 D), in Epidauros ( IG iv² . 1 323 ) and in Delphi in C5 ( CID i 7 Aa 6 ) and in C4 ( CID ii 22 -23 ). Andros was said to be under Naxian control in 494 (Hdt. 5 . 31 . 2 ). Herodotos reports Andrians participating in Xerxes' invasion of Greece (Hdt. 8 . 66 . 2 ; Aesch. Pers . 887 ). The island was besieged by Themistokles after an unsuccessful attempt at extortion (Hdt. 8 . 111 -12 ). Andros was a member of the Delian League,and may have been among the original members ( ATL iii. 198 -99 ). It belonged to the Island district ( IG i³ 270 . v . 20 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 262 . i . 19 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 21 ), a total of fourteen times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of first 12 tal. ( IG i³ 262 . i . 19 ), reduced to 6 tal. in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 22 ), but raised to 7 tal. in 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 21 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 64 ) ( 15 tal.). Plutarch ( Per . 11 . 5 ) mentions the dispatch of 250 Athenian klerouchoi , plausibly dated to c. 453 -448 (Figueira ( 1991 ) 220 with note W). Naval forces,probably with marines,participated in actions during the Peloponnesian War (Thuc. 4 . 42 . 1 , 7 . 57 . 4 , 8 . 69 . 3 ). In the last phase of the war they fought on the Spartan side (Diod. 13 . 69 . 4 -5 ; Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 31 ). In C4 Andros joined the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 .B. 16 ). In 356 the Athenians had a garrison and a general on Andros whose position was called an arche (Aeschin. 1 . 107 ; IG ii² 123 = Tod 156 ); see Reger ( 1994 a ) 314 -15 ). In the 370 s and later the Andrians participated closely enough with the Athenians in the administration of the amphiktyony on Delos to be punished by the Delians in 314 (Tréheux ( 1987 ) 386 ). In 411 a contingent of Andrian soldiers supported the Four Hundred in Athens (Thuc. 8 . 69 . 3 ), and from this Gehrke, Stasis 22 infers that Andros must have been one of the poleis in which the constitution was changed from a democracy to an oligarchy after the oligarchic revolution in Athens (cf. Thuc. 8 . 64 . 1 ). The Athenian decree on Andros of 357 / 6 ( IG ii² 123 . 9 ) indicates that the constitution had changed back to a democracy, probably in C4e. The only known public enactments of the Classical period are a treaty with Delphi (no. 177 ) about theoroi ( CID i 7 (C5s)) and a citizenship decree of C4 ( IG xii suppl. 245 ). We hear about a boule with a grammateus and a board of tamiai attached ( CID 1 7 ; IG xii suppl. 245 ). The eponymous official was an archon, indisputably attested from C3 onwards ( IG xii . 5 715 ), but probably referred to already in the Classical period ( CID i 7 A. 9 , cf. p. 22 ; Sherk ( 1990 ) 263 ). The Andrians dedicated at Delphi a statue of their oecist Andreus (Paus. 10 . 13 . 4 ; for the date, 412 / 11 or 308 , see Jacquemin ( 1999 ) 313 no . 63 ). Andros bestowed proxenia on a citizen from an unknown polis ( IG xii suppl. 245 (C4 )), and a citizen of Andros was appointed proxenos by Karthaia (no. 492 ) ( IG xii . 5 542 .b. 3 -7 (C4m)). C. 330 a theorodokos was appointed to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) ( SEG 23 189 . ii . 13 ). The protective deity was probably Apollo Pythios ( IG xii suppl. 245 . 14 ), though explicit testimony from the Archaic and Classical periods is absent.A stele recording a C4 proxeny decree was erected in his sanctuary ( IG xii suppl. 245 . 14 ). An inscription of perhaps C4mentions a cult of Zeus Meilichios ( IG xii . 5 727 ). The Andrians dedicated an οῖκος on Delos ( I.Délos 104 -24 . 36 ; cf. T réheux ( 1987 ) 381 -83 ). Two Andrians are attested as victors in the Olympic Games ( Olympionikai 339 , 588 ; Hdt. 9 . 33 . 2 ; Paus. 3 . 11 . 6 , 6 . 14 . 13 ). An Andrian boy is attested as victor at Oropos in, probably, 329 / 8 (Petrakos ( 1997 ) 409 -15 no. 520 . 19 = IG vii 414 ; Knoepfler ( 1993 ) for the date). The polis centre was located on the south-western coast of the island at the unoccupied site called Palaiopolis. It still has magnificent walls, which undoubtedly belong to C4 (so Sauciuc ( 1914 ) 10 -16 ) rather than to the Heltic period (so Tzedakis ( 1975 ) 323 ). The walls are implied in connection with the siege in 480 (Hdt. 8 . 112 ) and Alkibiades' attack in 408 (Diod. 13 . 69 . 4 ). Remains of the western wall stretch from the coast to the acropolis, c. 1600 m from the coast. Nothing is left of the other walls but, to judge from burials, the circuit must have enclosed an area of over 100 ha (Sauciac ( 1914 ) 10 -16 ). For the urban centre, see Palaiokrassa-Kopitsa ( 1996 ). The Pythion,attested in C4 ( IG xii suppl. 245 ), is probably the same as the sanctuary of Apollo ( τοgrave ιasperεροgraveν τουtilde Απόλλωνος ) mentioned repeatedly in Heltic inscriptions (e.g. IG xii . 5 715 8 (C3 )). A stoa of Classical date has been reported ( ArchEph ( 1964 ) 2 -4 ). A rock-cut inscription of perhaps C4e bearing the words µ ηgrave χέζειν γυναῖκα (Palaiokrassa ( 1993 ) 125 -26 ) may indicate a sanctuary dedicated to a female deity (Sève, BE ( 1995 ) 451 ). At least two important settlements are known outside the polis centre at Andros, one to the east at Zagora (Cambitoglou et al . ( 1971 ), ( 1988 )), the other west at Hypsele (Televantou ( 1996 ), ( 1999 )), both of which began in the Geometric period but continued to be occupied later. Hypsele had a temple (cf. Reger ( 1997 ) 469 ). A phrourion at Gaurion on the north-east coast was fortified by Alkibiades in 408 (Diod. 13 . 69 . 4 ). In the Archaic period Andros struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard. Denominations: stater (didrachm), drachm and fractions. Types: obv . amphora; rev . incuse square (Paschalis ( 1898 )). The coinage stopped c. 478 (Figueira ( 1998 ) 577 ). Later coins have been attributed to C4f (Paschalis ( 1898 ) 348 ; Sauciuc ( 1914 ) 77 ; Erxleben ( 1970 ) 70 ), but are perhaps better seen as Heltic (Head, HN ² 482 ). The Andrians founded colonies at Argilos (no. 554 ), Stagiros (no. 613 ), Akanthos (no. 559 ) and Sane (no. 600 ) (Thuc. 4 . 84 . 1 , 88 . 2 , 103 . 3 , 109 . 3 , 5 . 6 . 1 ). A disagreement with Chalkis (no. 365 ) over the distribution of territory in the colony at Sane led to arbitration by Erythraians (no. 845 ), Samians (no. 864 ) and Parians (no. 509 ) (Plut. Mor . 298 A-B; Piccirilli ( 1973 ) 7 -11 no. 2 )."
476,Astypalaia (Astypaleieus),The Aegean,36.35,26.2,1038,4796,"476 . Astypalaia (Astypaleieus) Map 61 . Lat. 36 . 35 , long. 26 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 ( 97 km ² ). Type: B. The toponym is Αστυπάλαια , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 48 ; Arist. fr. 366 , Rose; IG xii . 3 172 . 3 (C3 ); cf. SEG 27 503 ). The city-ethnic is Αστυπαλαιευacuteς ( IG i² 1046 with i³ p. 973 (C4 ); Ant.Pal.App . 6 . 44 (r 492 )). The earliest reference to Astypalaia as a polis (in the political sense) is in I.Priene 8 . 48 -49 , traditionally dated to the 320 s, but now downdated to the 280 s; see SEG 46 1479 . Polis status in the Classical period is indicated by Astypalaia's membership of the Delian League ( infra ), and by the C4 grant of ateleia obtained from Epidauros ( infra ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on Heltic coins (Head, HN ² 630 ) and in inscriptions ( IG xii . 3 215 (C3 ); Peek ( 1969 ) 38 -40 no. 87 . 11 -12 ), and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ). The individual and external use is attested in an Epidaurian proxeny decree ( IG iv² . 1 48 ( c. 300 )), in a private dedication from Delphi (Pomtow ( 1918 ) 64 no. 90 (C4m)), in a grant of citizenship ( IG iv² . 1 615 (C4 )), both for citizens of Astypalaia and for a group of individuals at Arkesine on Amorgos ( IG xii . 7 67 .A. 3 -4 = Migeotte ( 1984 ) 183 -87 no. 51 (C4l/C3e)).Alexander the Great's steersman Onesikritos was from Astypalaia ( FGrHist 134 T 1 (some say he was from Aigina), T 4 ; cf. Giannantoni ( 1990 ) ii. 511 -12 ). Patris is found in IG xii . 3 211 = CEG ii 866 (C4l/C3e). According to Ps.-Skymnos 551 , Astypalaia was a colony of Megara (no. 225 ), but a C4 inscription claims Epidauros (no. 348 ) as the metropolis ( IG iv² . 1 47 ). Astypalaia was a member of the Delian League.It belonged to the Karian district ( IG i³ 269 . iv . 17 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 14 ) to 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 . ii . 29 ), a total of thirteen times, three times completely restored, paying a phoros of 2 tal. ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 14 ), reduced to 1½ tal. in 443 / 2 ( IG i³ 269 . iv . 17 ) but raised to 2 tal. again in 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . i . 18 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 143 ). In C4s the Astypalaians obtained a grant of ateleia from Epidauros ( IG iv²1 . 47 ). Astypalaia received grain from Kyrene (no. 1028 ) c. 330 -326 (Tod 196 . 47 = SEG 9 . 2 . 47 ). Citizens from Astypalaia were appointed proxenoi by Epidauros ( IG iv² . 1 48 ( c. 300 )) and by Chios (no. 840 ) ( PEP Chios 50 (C4 )). Aristotle wrote of ηasper Αστυπαλαιέων γηtilde ( De anim . fr. 4 (C4m)).The earliest attestation of the eponymous official, a demiourgos , dates to C4l or C3e ( IG xii . 7 67 .A. 8 = Migeotte ( 1984 ) 183 -87 no. 51 ; Sherk ( 1990 ) 263 ). A sacred law of C4 is preserved in an inscription ( IG xii . 3 183 , which gives a date of c. 300 ; Le Guen-Pollet ( 1991 ) 80 -81 no. 24 ). A single month of the calendar, Artamitios, is known ( IG xii . 7 67 .A. 7 = Migeotte ( 1984 ) 183 -87 no. 51 ; cf. Trümpy, Monat . 197 -98 ). Pausanias reports a sanctuary of Athena in the story he tells of the Olympic victor Kleomedes of Astypalaia, who in 492 killed his opponent wrestling and went mad; he pulled down the roof of a school so that it fell upon sixty children, but he was later made a hero on the basis of advice from the oracle at Delphi (Paus. 6 . 9 . 6 -8 ; Anth . Pal . App . 6 . 44 ; Olympionikai 397 ). For a cult of Athena in C4 , see IG xii . 3 184 . Apollo had a sanctuary with at least one oikos and a cult statue (Peek ( 1969 ) 43 no. 89 ( c. 400 ); cf. IG xii . 3 185 ). A sanctuary of Artemis Lochia is reported in C4 (Peek ( 1969 ) 44 no. 92 ), and a cult of Hera in C4 (or C3 ) is also attested ( IG xii . 3 196 ). The ancient urban centre was located at modern Chora; a small site dated to the Classical period has been reported at Armenochori (perhaps a farm?: Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1973 ) 159 -62 ). To Astypalaia have been assigned some silver coins dated C5e to c. 460 . Denominations: stater, obol and fractions. Types: obv . amphora (stater), or vessel with handle (obol), or rose (tetartemorion); rev . oinochoe with lyre; legend: ΑΣΤΥ in incuse square (stater); obv . oinochoe with Α (obol); rev . incuse square with Α (tetartemorion). A different, anepigraphic series of staters on the Aiginetan standard has recently been assigned to the island. Types: obv . two dolphins; rev . two incuse squares in four compartments (Boutin ( 1986 ) 6 -10 ; as belonging only to an island in the Dodecanese, Hackens ( 1973 ) 210 ; see also Sheedy ( 1998 a ) 321 ). Another series of anepigraphic hemidrachms has been assigned to C4 . Types: obv . head of Helios; rev . Bow (E. S. G. Robinson ( 1949 ) 330 ; see Erxleben ( 1970 ) 83 ; Figueira ( 1998 ) 580 )."
477,Chalke (Chalkeates),The Aegean,36.15,27.35,783,3609,"477 . Chalke (Chalkeates) Map 60 (inset). Lat. 36 . 15 , long. 27 . 35 . Size of territory: 2 ( 28 km ² ). Type: B. The toponym is Χάλκη , ηasper (Thuc. 8 . 55 . 1 , 60 . 3 ; Steph. Byz. 682 . 1 ) or Χαλκία (Theophr. Hist. pl . 8 . 2 . 9 ; Strabo 10 . 5 . 14 -15 ) or Χάλκεια (Ps.Skylax 99 ), denoting both the island and the town (Strabo 10 . 5 . 15 ). The city-ethnic is Χαλκεάτας ( I.Knidos 605 (C4m); IG i³ 280 . i . 54 ) or Χαλκειάτης ( IG i³ 270 . iv . 7 ); Χαλκήτας is attested in C3 and later (Susini ( 1963 -64 ) 259 nos. 1 -2 ; Tit. Cam . 3 D C54 , 4 .b. 8 and 11 , 109 . 4 -5 ; IG xii . 1 844 . 33 -34 (C1 )). Chalke is not called a polis in any source,but its membership of the Delian League ( infra ) and a C4m treaty concluded with Knidos ( infra ) strongly suggest that Chalke was a polis in C5 -C4 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 280 . i . 54 ) and in the inscription from Knidos ( I.Knidos 605 ). The individual use is attested internally ( IG xii . 1 216 (Hell.)) and externally at Kameiros ( Tit. Cam . 3 ∆ C54 (C1l)). Chalke was a member of the Delian League.It belonged to the Karian district ( IG i³ 269 . iv . 6 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . i . 10 ) to 427 / 6 or 426 / 5 ( IG i³ 284 . 19 ), a total of seventeen times, three times completely restored, paying a phoros of first 3 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 263 . i . 10 ), reduced to 2 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 267 . iii . 22 ) in 445 / 4 or possibly already in 446 / 5 ( IG i³ 266 . iii . 27 , completely restored).It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 104 , 2 , 000 + dr.). In C4m the Chalkeatai concluded what is presumably an isopoliteia treaty with Knidos (no. 903 ) ( I.Knidos 605 ; cf. Gawantka ( 1975 ) 209 no. 11 and 38 n. 79 ). The Knidians granted the Chalkeatai the right to purchase landed property and to participate in Knidian citizenship ( politeia ). The last preserved line of the inscription records the beginning of the decree of the Chalkeatai which presumably granted the Knidians the same privileges. By C4l, however, Chalke had become part of the Rhodian state, for Theophrastos calls it Χαλκίαν τηgraveν νηtildeσον τηgraveν ' Ροδίων ( Hist. pl . 8 . 2 . 9 ). More specifically, it was turned into a deme of Kameiros (no. 996 ) ( Tit. Cam . 109 (C4l); in C3lists of damiourgoi : Tit. Cam . 3 ∆ C54 (C1l), 4 .b. 8 , 11 (first century ad )), although perhaps the process of incorporat- ing its inhabitants into the political structure of Kameiros had not yet been completed by about 325 , since the Chalkeatai are treated as exceptions in a law of approximately that date ( Tit. Cam . 109 . 4 -5 ). According to Strabo ( 10 . 5 . 15 ), the island had a harbour ( limen ); its location has been a matter of dispute (see Susini ( 1963 -64 ) 249 ). Strabo also mentions a sanctuary of Apollo, who may have been the protective deity. A dedication to Asklepios is known from C4 or perhaps C3 ( IG xii . 1 956 ); mention of Zeus and Hekate is likely to have been late ( IG xii . 1 958 ). The polis centre lay to the north and east of the modern settlement, which occupies the acropolis with its castle of the Knights of St John (Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1973 ) 156 ; Susini ( 1963 -64 ) 247 ). The preserved wall includes sections that have been dated to C6 , but much of it is undoubtedly Heltic (Susini ( 1963 -64 ) 248 ). No coinage is known. Some C4 coins inscribed ΧΑ may belong to the present community or to Karian Chalketor (no. 881 ); obv . female head, rev . spearhead ( BMC18 (Caria and Islands))."
478,Delos (Delios),The Aegean,37.25,25.15,2136,10264,"478 . Delos (Delios) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 25 , long. 25 . 15 . Size of territory: 1 ( 3 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is ∆ηtildeλος , ηasper (Hom. Od . 6 . 162 ; Hymn. Hom. Ap. 27 ; Hdt. 1 . 64 . 2 ; IG i³ 402 . 15 , 1460 . 9 , 1461 . 6 ), in Doric ∆αtildeλος (Pind. Ol . 6 . 59 ), denoting both the island (Thuc. 3 . 104 . 1 ) and the town (Ps.Skylax 58 ). The city-ethnic is ∆ήλιος ( I.Délos 98 A. 16 ( 377 / 6 )). Delos is called a polis in the political sense throughout C4 ( I.Délos 36 . 2 = CEG ii 836 ; I.Délos 74 . 15 -16 : τηtildeς πόλεως τηtildeς ∆ηλίων ). In Ps.-Skylax 58 ∆ηtildeλος is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε εν ταῖς νήσοις . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in inscriptions ( IG i³ 1460 . 14 ( 410 / 9 ); I.Délos 71 . 2 (C5 /C4 ), 74 . 7 (C4s)) and on coins ( infra ) and externally in inscriptions ( IG i³ 130 . 19 ( c. 432 )) and in literary sources (Hdt. 6 . 97 . 1 ; Thuc. 5 . 1 ; Hyp. fr. 74 , Sauppe). The individual use is attested both internally ( I.Délos 98 A. 16 ( 377 / 6 )) and externally at Athens and Karthaia on Keos ( IG i³ 1349 ( c. 530 ); IG xii . 5 542 . 49 (C4 )). Strabo ( 10 . 5 . 1 ) carefully excludes Delos from the Kyklades,which are,rather,the islands around it. The territory of Delos was of course fundamentally the island itself, but ever since Polykrates of Samos attached Rheneia (no. 514 ) to Delos by a chain (Thuc. 3 . 104 . 2 , cf. 1 . 13 . 6 ; Shipley ( 1987 ) 94 -97 ), the Delians controlled the southern half of Rheneia below the isthmus which divides the island into two unequal halves, as well as the eastern part of the half above the isthmus (see the sketch map in Kent ( 1948 ) 248 fig. 3 ). This land supported several sanctuaries (see infra ) and the necessary Delian cemeteries, given the prohibition against burial on the sacred island (see Couilloud ( 1974 )). By C4 the rest of Delian territory on Rheneia was divided into eleven sacred estates ( temene ), which were rented out on contract; these no doubt were established soon after the Rheneian territory came into Delian possession ( I.Délos 89 , 104 -11 A; Kent ( 1948 ) 245 -52 ; Charre and Couilloud-Le Dinahet ( 1999 )). The Delians also owned property on Syros ( I.Délos 104 -11 A 21 ) and Tenos ( I.Délos 104 -8 B 46 (C4s); cf. I.Délos 104 -32 . 4 , apparently under an entry referring to houses rented out: εν Τήνωι εν άσ [ τει ---), perhaps having come into Delian possession as a result of foreclosure for unpaid loans (Étienne ( 1990 ) 183 ; contra Reger ( 1994 b ) 227 -28 , and infra ). In the Archaic period Delos was under the sway of the Naxians (no. 507 ) (generally, see Gallet de Santerre ( 1958 )), though there is no reason to believe that the Delians thereby ceased to enjoy the status of a polis . Under Peisistratos the Athenians claimed Delos and carried out a purification (cf. Lanzillotta ( 1996 ) 275 -79 ). When Datis passed by Delos in 490 , the islanders fled to T enos, but he respected the sanctity of the island and called them back (Hdt. 6 . 97 . 1 ). After the end of the Persian War the Athenians chose Delos as headquarters of the Delian League; meetings were held in the sanctuary (Thuc. 1 . 96 . 2 ). The sanctuary was controlled by an amphiktyony under the Athenians ( 478 ?-404 ). In 426 / 5 the Athenians carried out renewed purifications (Thuc. 1 . 8 . 1 , 3 . 104 ), and in 422 they expelled the Delians, who were permitted by the Persians to live at Adramyttion (no. 800 ) (Thuc. 5 . 1 , 8 . 108 . 4 : calling the action a metoikismos ; Paus. 4 . 27 . 9 ); but at least some of them were brought back to Delos in 421 (Thuc. 5 . 32 . 1 ). After the end of the Peloponnesian War the Delians enjoyed political autonomy from 404 to 394 , though subject to a subordinate treaty with the Spartans (no. 345 ) ( I.Délos 87 = Choix no. 8 ( 402 -399 ); see Prost ( 2001 )). In 394 the Athenians again secured control over the sanctuary (though not the Delian polis ), which they held and administered through another amphiktyony until 314 , sometimes with the co-operation of the Andrians (no. 475 ) (see e.g. I.Délos 97 . 5 ; 97 bis 1-2 ; 98 . A 63 , 64 , 96 ; 100 . 7 , 10 , Andrian amphiktyoneis ). Aristotle wrote a Constitution of the Delians (no. 38 and frr. 495 -97 , Gigon). Several Delian laws have been preserved epigraphically, including an exclusion of xenoi from a sanctuary, perhaps the temenos of the Archegetes ( I.Délos 68 (C4 ), with Butz ( 1996 ) 78 -82 ; Le Guen-Pollet ( 1991 ) 77 -79 no. 22 , and Vallois ( 1929 ) 209 n. 2 ), and a regulation to keep a spring clean ( I.Délos 69 (C4f); Le Guen-Pollet ( 1991 ) 61 -62 no. 14 (C5 )). A grant of ateleia is known ( I.Délos 71 = Choix no. 6 (C4 ?)). In 376 / 5 a fine and permanent exile was imposed on Delians who had seized amphiktyoneis in the sanctuary of Apollo, dragged them out, and beaten them ( I.Délos 98 B 24 -52 ). A stasis between a pro-Athenian and an anti-Athenian faction in the 330 s can be inferred from an Athenian citizenship decree to an exiled citizen of Delos and his family ( IG ii² 222 ; cf. Gehrke, Stasis 49 ). A fragment of Hyperides'Delian Speech (fr. 74 ) recounts a lawsuit between the Delians and the Rheneians over responsibility for the deaths of Aiolian visitors on Rheneia. The Delians bestowed proxenia on citizens of Athens (no. 361 ) ( I.Délos 74 (C4l)), Ios (no. 484 ) ( I.Délos 76 ), and Kition ( IG xi . 4 512 (C4l)), and proxenia combined with citizenship on a citizen of Byzantion (no. 674 ) ( IG xi . 4 510 (C4l)). Delian citizens were appointed proxenoi by Athens ( I.Délos 88 ( 368 )), Karthaia ( IG xii . 5 542 . 49 (C4m)); see Marek ( 1984 ) 71 -73 , 247 -80 . The eponymous official of Delos was an archon ( IG i³ 1460 . 9 -10 ( 410 / 9 ); I.Délos 87 ( c. 403 ); Sherk ( 1990 ) 269 -70 ). Wehear of prytaneis ( I.Délos 88 = Choix 10 ( 369 / 8 )), a boule ( I.Délos 71 (C5 /C4 ), 72 ) and an assembly ( I.Délos 88 ( 369 / 8 )). Decrees were passed typically by the boule and the demos ( I.Délos 71 -73 (C5 /C4 -390 s)), the latter sometimes simply as ∆ήλιοι ( I.Délos 71 ); occasionally a named person moved the decree ( I.Délos 73 ( 390 s), 74 (C4e)). Other known officials include an arxas stephanephoros ( I.Délos 37 (C4 )), hieropoioi ( I.Délos 73 ( 390 s)), grammateus of the boule ( I.Délos 88 ), an epistates ( I.Délos 88 ), and strategoi ( I.Délos 88 ). Neokoroi appear as helpers of the amphiktyoneis until 409 or 408 ; thereafter they are called episkopoi or epitropoi ( I.Délos 93 . 10 -15 and 94 . 4 ). The civic subdivisions (clearly modelled on Athens) (Jones, POAG 211 -12 ) comprised four phylai (only Αργαδεῖς is known by name: IG xi . 4 1155 . 3 (C3f)), several trittyes (e.g. ηasper τριττυgraveς ηasper Μαψιχιδῶν ( IG xi . 2 199 A. 12 ( 275 ); cf. Bruneau and Ducat ( 1983 ) 123 ). The protective deity was of course Apollo Delios (Ananios 1 . 1 , West ² ; Hymn. Hom. Ap . passim ; Pind. Pae . 5 , Race; on Pindar's conections with Delos, see Simon ( 1997 ); on the tradition of Apollo's birth, see Le Roy ( 1973 )). The cult statue of Apollo made by Tektaios and Angelion (Paus. 2 . 32 . 5 , 9 . 35 . 3 ) replaced a xoanon taken to Epidelion (Paus. 3 . 23 . 3 ). There was also a xoanon of Aphrodite (Paus. 9 . 40 . 3 -4 ). The dedication to Athena Polias ( I.Délos 15 = LSAG 306 no. 42 (C6l)), which is carved on a column of the bouleuterion , should probably be attributed to the Athenians. Apollo's sanctuary, which can be traced back to Bronze Age roots,was the chief ιasperερόν of Delos (Courby ( 1931 ) 1 -106 ; Bruneau and Ducat ( 1983 ) 130 -33 ), but of course the tiny island was saturated with sanctuaries. These include an Artemision on Delos which dates in its original form to C7 ( I.Délos 73 ( 390 s); Bruneau and Ducat ( 1983 ) 154 -59 ) and an Αρτε µ ίσιον εν νήσω Αsubiota recently shown to have been located on Rheneia (Tréheux ( 1995 )); a Heraion dating from C7 (Plassart ( 1928 ); Bruneau and Ducat ( 1983 ) 230 -31 ); a Letoon built c. 540 (Gallet de Santerre ( 1959 ) 37 -72 ; Bruneau and Ducat ( 1983 ) 168 -71 ); a Dodekatheon to the Twelve Gods, but which had only altars in C5 -C4 (Will ( 1955 ); Bruneau and Ducat ( 1983 ) 165 -66 ); an Archegesion for Anios, the founder of Delos, of C6e (F. Robert ( 1953 ); Bruneau and Ducat ( 1983 ) 200 -1 ; Bruneau ( 1970 ) 413 -30 on the cult); an Aphrodision which was consecrated C4l (Roussel ( 1987 ) 240 -42 ; Bruneau ( 1970 ) 331 -44 ; Bruneau and Ducat ( 1983 ) 213 -14 ). Delos is also rich in public buildings: the ekklesiasterion dates from C5e (Hansen and Fischer-Hansen ( 1994 ) 61 -62 ; Vallois ( 1929 ) 278 -302 ; Bruneau and Ducat ( 1983 ) 159 ); the bouleuterion from C6f (Gneisz ( 1990 ) 45 -46 , 315 no. 17 ; cf. I.Délos 84 ( c. 300 )); the prytaneion was begun before C4m (Étienne ( 1997 ); Bruneau and Ducat ( 1983 ) 135 -37 ; S. G. Miller ( 1978 ) 67 -78 , as C5 ; cf. also IG xi 2 . 144 .A. 98 , 101 ); the hieropoion is C4l (Tréheux ( 1987 )). The impressive theatre ( TGR ii. 192 -94 ) goes back to C4 but was not finished till C3m ( IG xi . 2 287 .A 92 -93 , work still going on in 250 ; Vallois ( 1944 ) 220 -38 ). As a sacred site Delos was always unwalled (see Rigsby ( 1996 ) 51 -53 ); for Datis, see supra ; on the 'battle of Delos' inferred from Hippoc. Epid . 5 . 61 and 7 . 33 , see F. Robert ( 1973 )). The city seems originally to have occupied land north of the sanctuary; the habitation quarter known as the Quartier du Théâtre was a C3 development (Chamonard ( 1922 )), and of course the great period of expansion on Delos fell in the decades after the Romans gave Delos back to the Athenians in 167 (Roussel ( 1987 ) passim ; Habicht ( 1997 ) 246 -63 ). On the harbour facilities of Delos, see Duchêne and Fraisse ( 2001 ). Delos struck silver coins on the Euboic standard from C6l to C5e, stopping after 478 . The Archaic and Classical coinage of Delos still lacks a thorough scholarly study (Hackens ( 1973 ); Bruneau and Ducat ( 1983 ) 107 -11 ; V. Chankowski is planning such a study).Types: obv . lyre, sometimes with legend ∆ ; rev . incuse square in eight or four compartments; or spokes of wheel with retrograde legend ∆ΗΛΙ (Head, HN ² 485 ; Erxleben ( 1970 ) 70 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) 45 -46 )."
479,Helene,The Aegean,37.4,24.05,467,2115,"479 . Helene Map 59 (by a lapsus there as Helena). Lat. 37 . 40 , long. 24 . 05 . Size of territory: 1 ( 18 km ² ). Type: [A]. The toponym is ' Ελένη , ηasper (Strabo 10 . 5 . 3 ), denoting both the island and the town (Ps.-Skylax 58 ), or Μάκρις (Steph. Byz. 265 . 5 ). Steph.Byz. 265 . 6 -7 conjectures two different forms of the city-ethnic. Artemidoros ( apud Strabo) starts the Kyklades with Helene; Strabo excludes it. In Ps.-Skylax 58 ' Ελένη is one of the toponyms listed after πόλεις αιasperacuteδε εν ταῖς νήσοις . I karos (IKARIOS) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 26 . 10 . Size of territory: 4 ( 256 km ² ). The toponym is /acuteΙκαρος , ηasper ( IG i³ 261 . v . 6 ; F.Delphes iii . 1 497 . 12 (C4l/C3e); Hdt. 6 . 95 . 2 ; Thuc. 3 . 29 . 1 ), in late sources sometimes ' Ικαρία , ηasper (Strabo 14 . 1 . 19 ; Papalas ( 1992 ) 183 no. 5 , 185 no. 11 ). The ethnic is ' Ικάριος ( IG ii² 8935 (C4s)), in late sources sometimes ' Ικαριευacuteς ( IG xii . 5 723 . 18 (C2 )). According to Ps.-Skylax 58 , Ikaros was δίπολις , and indeed two poleis , Oinoe and Thermai, are known. Unlike other islands with multiple poleis , the inhabitants do not always appear simply as Ikarians. Both poleis were members of the Delian League but always paid separately; in the tribute lists they are recorded as Οιναῖοι εν ' Ικάροι ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 2 -3 ) or εχς ' Ικάρο ( IG i³ 262 . ii . 9 -10 ) and as Θερ µ αῖοι εν ' Ικάροι ( IG i³ 261 . v V. 6 -7 ) or εχς ' Ικάρο ( IG i³ 262 . ii . 2 -3 ). Both poleis are attested fifteen times in the tribute lists ( infra ), but only twice are they recorded next to each other ( 264 . i . 27 -8 , 265 . i . 29 -30 ). According to Anaximenes of Lampsakos, Ikaros was 'settled' by Milesians (no. 854 ) ( FGrHist 72 ) fr. 26 ); the date must be C4 or earlier, perhaps in the Archaic period (Manganaro ( 1963 -64 ) 297 ); if Archaic, perhaps starting with the Milesian expedition against Naxos, the island had expelled the Milesians by c. 478 (see Ehrhardt ( 1983 ) 18 -19 ). There are no known coins struck as island issues (see L. Robert ( 1969 -90 ) i. 333 -34 n. 2 , 554 -55 n. 4 )."
480,Oine (Oin(o)aios),The Aegean,37.4,26.1,749,3422,"480 . Oine (Oin(o)aios) Map. 61 . Lat. 37 . 40 , long. 26 . 10 . Size of territory: 3 ( c. 125 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Οίνη , ηasper ( IG xi . 4539 . 7 (C4l/C3e); but note that this is an honorific decree for an individual described as ' Ικάριον εξ Οίνης ; cf. also L. Robert ( 1938 ) 113 n. 1 and SEG 42 779 ) or sometimes in later sources Οινόη , ηasper (Strabo 14 . 1 . 19 ; Ath. 30 D). The city-ethnic is Οιναῖος ( IG i³ 262 . ii . 9 ; I.Délos 98 .A. 13 ; coins, see infra ), in late sources sometimes Οινόαιος (Ath. 30 D, perhaps quoting Eparchides ( FGrHist 437 ) fr. 1 ). In the Athenian tribute lists the community is referred to as Οιναῖοι εχς ' Ικάρο ( IG i³ 262 . ii . 9 , 262 . ii . 9 -10 , 263 . ii . 2 -3 ) or εν ' Ικάροι ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 2 ). Oine is referred to as a polis in the urban sense by the term δίπολις at Ps.-Skylax 58 . It is called a polis in the political sense in a C4 proxeny decree ( IG xii . 6 1224 . 5 ; see also I.Délos 98 .A. 13 and B. 5 ( 377 -373 ), where the Οιναῖοι εξ ' Ικάρο are listed under the heading: αιasperacuteδε τῶν πόλεων (A. 11 , B. 1 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins: ΟΙΝΑΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 602 , from c. 300 ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 262 . ii . 9 ). The earliest attestation of the individual use of the city-ethnic is from C2e ( IG xi . 4 811 . 3 -4 ). Oine was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district ( IG i³ 269 . i . 9 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 7 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . iv . 57 ) a total of fifteen times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of first 1 tal., 2 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 7 -8 ), reduced to 1 tal. in 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 30 ) and further reduced to 4 , 000 dr. in the following year ( IG i³ 266 . i . 9 ), but raised again to 1 tal. in 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . i . 52 -53 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 175 -76 ). Apart from membership of the Delian League and contributions to the Delian Amphiktyony, the only two pieces of information we have about Oine as a political community are the Oinaians'grant of proxenia to a citizen of Byzantion (no. 674 ) ( IG xii . 6 1224 (C4 )) and a grant of proxenia by the Delians (no. 478 ) to a citizen of Oine ( IG xi . 4 539 (C4l/C3e)). The ancient settlement was once thought to occupy a hill (an acropolis) near modern Kambos, but in 1939 Politis showed that there was no ancient settlement on the hill; he favoured a location by the sea on the left bank of the river that flows by Kambos into the sea (Politis ( 1939 -40 ) 139 -43 ). The polis centre is located on the north coast. It seems likely that Oine's territory included the western part of the island, and thus the temple of Artemis Tauropolos.Graves and villages of Classical date have been reported (N. Zapheiropoulos ( 1963 a ), ( 1963 b )). The Tauropolion, the sanctuary of Artemis (Strabo 14 . 1 . 19 ), was located on the north coast, c. 9 km west of Oine, in whose territory it surely was (though it seems to have operated in some sense as an island-wide sanctuary,perhaps rather like Klopedi on Lesbos). Ceramics start in C7 , and building by C6 , and continuously thereafter (Papalas ( 1983 ); Politis ( 1939 -40 ); Ph. Zapheiropoulou ( 1989 )). Recent finds of rock-cut inscriptions mention the Theoi Samothrakoi (Hatzianastasiou ( 1981 ) 378 )."
481,Therma (Thermaios),The Aegean,37.4,26.1,414,1836,"481 . *Therma (Thermaios) Map. 61 . Lat. 37 . 40 , long. 26 . 10 . Size of territory: 3 ( 125 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is unattested. In the Heltic period the urban centre was called ∆ράκανον (Strabo 14 . 1 . 19 ) after the nearby promon- tory. The city-ethnic is Θερ µ αῖος ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 9 -10 , 261 . v . 6 -7 ). In the Athenian tribute lists the community is referred to as Θερ µ αῖοι εχς ' Ικάρο ( 262 . ii . 2 -3 ) or εν ' Ικάροι ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 36 -37 ). The Thermaioi are referred to as having a polis in the urban sense by the term δίπολις at Ps.-Skylax 58 . For polis in the political sense, see I.Délos 98 .A. 14 and B. 4 -5 ( 377 -373 ), where the Θερ µ αῖοι εξ ' Ικάρο are listed under the heading αιasperacuteδε τῶν πόλεων (A. 11 , B. 1 ). The collective use of the ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 9 -10 ). The earliest attestation of the individual use of the city-ethnic is from C2e ( IG xi . 4 811 . 3 -4 ). Asklepios has been suggested as the chief deity on the basis of the Heltic renaming of the city as Asklepieis (L. Robert ( 1969 -90 ) i. 549 -68 ). Therma was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district ( IG i³ 269 . i . 4 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 9 -10 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . iv . 35 ), a total of fifteen times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 3 , 000 dr. in all years ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 9 -10 ). The urban centre was located on the south-east coast of the island. A nearby cemetery shows use from the Archaic period (Leekley and Noyes ( 1975 ) 20 ). Ancient remains are few (a bath complex has been reported (Lauffer ( 1989 ) 278 ; Pleket ( 1960 )) because most of the site slid into the sea, perhaps as a result of an earthquake in 198 (Papalas ( 1992 ) 122 )."
482,Ikos (Ikios),The Aegean,39.1,23.55,428,2055,"482 . Ikos (Ikios) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 10 , long. 23 . 55 . Size of territory: 2 ( 65 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is /acute Ικος , ηasper (Ps.Skymnos 582 ) or ' Ικός (Strabo 9 . 5 . 16 ), denoting both the island and the town (Ps.-Skylax 58 ). The city-ethnic is /acute Ικιος ( IG i³ 262 . iv . 2 ). The island is sometimes regarded as one of the Kyklades (Steph. Byz. 330 . 8 ), but Strabo groups it with the islands that lie off Magnesia (Strabo 9 . 5 . 16 ). Ps.-Skylax 58 calls the island δίπολις , principally in the urban sense, but no trace of two poleis recurs in the sources (which are meagre) or the archaeology (likewise). The political sense is attested in IG ii² 43 . 78 and 84 , where the Ikioi under the heading πόλεις are listed as members of the Second Athenian Naval League. The collective use of the city-ethnic appears internally on amphora stamps ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 262 . iv . 2 ). The individual and external use is attested in an Attic sepulchral inscription ( IG ii² 8936 (C4f)). The amphora stamps inscribed ΙΚΙΩΝ ( IG xii . 8 665 ) or ΙΚΙΟΝ (nominative neuter singular) are from C3 or earlier (Doulgeri-Intzessiloglou and Garlan ( 1990 ) 388 with n. 78 , 373 fig. 7 ; cf. Garlan ( 1999 ) 19 ). Ikos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 51 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 262 . iv . 2 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 18 ), a total of seventeen times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 500 dr. in all years ( IG i³ 262 . iv . 2 ). Ikos also joined the Second Athenian Confederacy in the 370 s ( IG ii² 43 . 84 ). Remains of the ancient urban centre on the south-eastern coast of the island include fortification walls of C4 (Philippson ( 1959 ) 48 ). An atelier for the production of amphoras has been found at Tsoukalia, dating from the Classical period and later; finds include stamps marked ΙΚΙΟΝ or ΙΚΙΩΝ ( supra ). Farmsteads of C4 have also been located ( BCH 124 ( 2000 ) 960 -61 )."
483,Imbros (Imbrios),The Aegean,40.1,25.45,1294,5720,"483 . Imbros (Imbrios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 10 , long. 25 . 45 . Size of territory: 4 ( 275 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is /acute Ι µ βρος , ηasper (Hom. Il . 13 . 33 ; Hymn.Hom.Ap . 36 ; Thuc. 8 . 102 . 2 ; F.Delphes iii . 1 497 . 14 (C4l/C3e)), denoting both the island and the town (Ps.-Skylax 67 ). The city-ethnic is /acuteΙ µ βριος (Archil. 114 . 3 , West; IG i³ 265 . ii . 112 ). Imbros is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 67 and in the political sense in the King's Peace (Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 31 ). In the Athenian tribute lists the Imbrians are twice recorded under the heading h αίδε πόλες ( IG i³ 282 .B i . 15 -16 , 19 , 285 . i . 107 -8 , 110 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ). For the external and individual use, see Archil. 114 . 3 . A C5s Athenian sepulchral inscription has, instead, εξ /acuteΙ µ βρου ( IG i³ 1350 ). Like Lemnos, Imbros was seized by the Athenians c. 500 (Hdt. 6 . 41 . 2 -4 , 104 . 1 ; see Salomon ( 1997 ) 45 ) and resettled with expatriate Athenians. The Imbrians were members of the Delian League.Imbros belonged to the Island district ( IG i³ 269 . v . 34 ), which indicates that, like the Lemnians, the Imbrians were allies (Thuc. 3 . 5 . 1 , 7 . 57 . 2 , 8 . 102 -3 ) and not Athenian klerouchs like the Skyrians (Graham ( 1983 ) 175 -84 ; Salomon ( 1997 ) 31 -66 ; cf. Cargill ( 1995 ) 5 -6 ). Imbros is recorded in the tribute lists from 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 112 ) to 421 / 20 ( IG i³ 285 . i . 110 ) a total of twelve times, five times completely restored, paying a phoros of 3 , 300 dr. in 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 112 ), raised to 1 tal. in, perhaps, 442 / 1 ( IG i³ 270 . v . 36 ). In 429 / 8 Imbros is listed among poleis which καταδελ ˜ οσι τοgrave µ φόρον (present a voucher for tribute), presumably contributing to the maintenance of the Hellespontophylakes and serving as bases for the fleet patrolling the Hellespontine waters ( IG i³ 282 .B i . 15 -16 , 19 ; cf. IG i³ 285 . i . 107 -8 , 10 ; Thuc. 2 . 24 . 1 ). Imbros was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 98 ) ( 1 tal., but both ethnic and amount restored). In the Peace of 404 Athens had to surrender Imbros (Andoc. 3 . 12 ; Aeschin. 2 . 76 -77 ), but by 392 , after a short period of independence (Andoc. 3 . 12 , 14 ) the Athenians had regained control of the island (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 15 ), and Athenian possession was confirmed by the King's Peace of 386 (Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 31 ). Like Lemnos ( Agora xix L 3 . 13 , 20 , 22 , 33 , 42 , 47 ), Imbros was now inhabited by Athenian klerouchs. For the view that only some of the inhabitants were klerouchs, whereas the rest were naturalised Imbrians, see Salomon ( 1997 ) 75 -76 . Imbros was still Athenian in the 320 s (Arist. Ath . Pol . 62 . 2 ; IG ii² 3206 ; cf. SEG 39 211 ), and remained Athenian by the Peace of 322 (Diod. 18 . 18 . 4 ; see Cargill ( 1995 ) 42 -58 ). In C4 the Imbrians were in full possession of Athenian citizenship (Dem. 4 . 34 , 7 . 4 ; Aeschin. 2 . 72 ). As an Athenian dependency the Imbrian state is called Αθηναίων οasper δηtilde µ ος οasper εν /acuteΙ µ βρΩsubiotaω ( IG xii . 8 46 ; IG ii² 3206 , cf. SEG 39 . 211 ( c. 325 )) or οasper δηtilde µ ος οasper εν /acuteΙ µ βρΩsubiotaω ( IG ii² 3203 (C4m)), but in the Athenian tribute lists it is given as /acuteΙ µ βριοι ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 112 , etc.). All attestations of civic subdivisions copy Athens: citizens were organised into the Kleisthenic phylai and demoi ( IG xii . 8 63 ( 352 / 1 )), and retained this system even after Imbros had broken away from Athens ( IG xii . 8 47 ( c. 318 -307 )); see Jones, POAG 187 -88 . Both when the Imbrians were part of the Athenian state ( IG xii . 8 46 ( c. 350 -325 )) and when they were independent ( IG xii . 8 47 -48 ( c. 318 -307 )), decrees were proposed in accordance with a probouleumatic procedure ( 46 . 4 -7 ) and passed by the boule and the demos ( 46 . 1 , 47 . 13 , 48 . 6 -7 ) in an εκκλησία ( 47 . 3 , 48 . 4 ) presided over by an epistates and two symproedroi ( 47 . 3 -4 , 48 . 4 -5 ). The eponymous official was the Athenian archon when Imbros was part of the Athenian state ( IG xii . 8 63 . 1 ) and the island's own archon when Imbros was independent ( IG xii . 8 47 . 9 ), but see Cargill ( 1995 ) 146 ; Sherk ( 1990 ) 270 -72 . An Athenian law of 374 / 3 regulates the 8⅓ per cent tax on grain imports from Imbros (Stroud ( 1998 ) 4 -5 ; cf. IG ii² 1672 . 297 ). One monthname is known: Hekatombaion, an Athenian reflection ( IG xii . 8 47 ; see Trümpy, Monat . 117 ). The patron deity was Athena Polias ( IG xii . 8 58 . 10 ). There was a cult of the Twelve Gods ( IG xii . 8 63 ( 352 / 1 )), and the famous Kabeirion for the Θεοιgrave Μεγάλοι attested in inscriptions ( IG xii . 8 51 , 71 -74 (all Hell.); cf. Fredrich ( 1908 ) 97 -99 ) and by Strabo ( 10 . 3 . 21 ) (see Hemberg ( 1950 ) 37 -43 ). Steph. Byz. 331 . 14 -15 reports a sanctuary of Hermes, whose worship is attested in C4 ( IG xii . 8 68 -69 ; Fredrich ( 1908 ) 100 ). The chief Imbrian river was called the Ilisus (Plin. HN 4 . 72 ), no doubt an echo of Attika to be attributed to the klerouchs (see Fredrich ( 1908 ) 82 ). The urban centre has remains, including a city wall, that have been dated to C4 (Fredrich ( 1908 ) 85 -88 ). The island is still little explored archaeologically.

484,Ios (Ietes),The Aegean,36.45,25.15,993,4352,"484 . Ios (Ietes) Map 61 . Lat. 36 . 45 , long. 25 . 15 . Size of territory: 3 ( 109 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is /acuteΙος , ηasper ( IG xii . 5 1004 . 4 (C4 /C3 ); F.Delphes iii . 1 497 . 13 (C4l/C3e); Strabo 10 . 5 . 1 ), denoting both the island ( Ath. Pal . 7 . 1 ) and the town (Ps.-Skylax 67 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ιήτης ( IG xii . 5 1002 . 3 (C4 ); I.Délos 98 A. 13 ( 377 / 6 )). Ios is called a polis both in the urban sense (Ps.-Skylax 58 ) and in the political sense ( IG xii . 5 1002 . 3 (C4 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and in inscriptions ( IG xii . 5 1002 -4 (C4l); IG xii suppl. 168 (C4 in LGPN , but for the Antigonos as Gonatas, not Monophthalmos, see Habicht ( 1996 )) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ) and on Delos ( I.Délos 98 A. 13 ( 377 / 6 )). The individual and external use appears also on inscriptions of Delos ( I.Délos 76 . 3 (C4s); I.Délos 104-26 .C. 2 = Choix no. 12 (C4 ), 104 -26 B (C4m), which record the acquittal of an Ietan tried in Athens; cf. Stumpf ( 1987 ) 211 -13 ). Patris is found in Arist. fr. 76 , Rose. Ios was a member of the Delian League.It belonged to the Island district ( IG i³ 269 . v . 27 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 14 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 20 ), a total of sixteen times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 tal. in 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 14 ) to 452 / 1 ( 261 . i . 13 ), lowered to 840 dr. in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 23 ), but raised to 3 , 000 dr. in 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . i . 87 ) or some years before. Ios was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 77 ) ( 1 tal., but amount restored). In C4 Ios was a member of the Delian Amphiktyony ( I.Délos 98 .A. 13 , 104 -28 aA. 14 , bA 20 ). Decrees ( psephismata ) moved by named individuals ( IG xii . 5 1001 -4 (C4 -C3e)) were put to the vote by prytaneis ( IG xii suppl. 168 ) or four proedroi ( IG xii . 5 1002 , 1004 ) and passed by the boule and demos ( IG xii . 5 2 , 1002 , 1004 ) or sometimes just the demos ( IG xii . 5 1001 , suppl. 168 ) presided over by an epistates ( IG xii . 5 2 , 1001 ). Attested officials are a board of strategoi and some trierarchs ( IG xii . 5 1004 ), a board of praktores ( IG xii . 5 1001 ), a board of eklogeis ( IG xii . 5 1001 -2 , 1004 ) and a board of hieropoioi ( IG xii . 5 2 = LSCG 199 -200 no. 105 ).A decree of C4l ( 308 -306 ) speaks of the restoration of the ancestral laws ( τουgraveς νό µ ους τουgraveς πατρίους ) ( IG xii suppl. 168 . 3 )). From C5l and C4 are preserved two laws about grazing sheep ( IG xii . 5 1 , 2 A = LSCG nos. 104 -5 ). There is no real evidence for civic subdivisions (Jones, POAG 214 ). Ios bestowed proxenia on citizens of Karystos (no. 373 ) ( IG xii . 5 2 A (C4 )), Athens (no. 361 ) ( IG xii . 5 1000 (C4 )) and Astypalaia (no. 476 ) ( IG xii . 5 1003 ( c. 300 )). Citizens of Ios were appointed proxenoi by Delos (no. 478 ) ( I.Délos 76 (C4s)) and Pholegandros (no. 513 ) ( IG xii . 5 9 (C4 )). The protective deities were Athena Polias and Zeus Polieus ( IG xii . 5 8 (C3s)). The Ietan calendar included a month named after Homer, though from when is not clear (Masouris ( 1992 )); the poet's mother is said to have been from Ios ([Plut.] Vit. Hom. 4 ). An extra-mural sanctuary of Poseidon Phytalmios(?) has been reported (Graindor ( 1904 ) 310 ). There was a sanctuary of Apollo Pythios, where public enactments were published ( IG xii . 5 3 (C5 ), 1000 . 16 -17 (C4 )), and a communal cult of Homer, which probably had a sanctuary or heroon of some sort (Paus. 10 . 24 . 2 ; Strabo 10 . 5 . 1 ; IG xii . 5 * 1 1 -* 1 6 ). The urban centre lies under modern Chora, but remains of the temple of Apollo Pythios have been identified ( IG xii . 5 100 with Graindor ( 1904 ) 308 -9 , 311 -12 ).An inscription mentions a place called Philotos ( IG xii . 5 1005 . 4 ), but it has not been further identified. Remains of an undated defence circuit are still visible; it enclosed an area of less than 10 ha, perhaps, 5 -9 ha (Brun ( 1996 ) 149 -50 and personal information).

485,Kalymna (Kalymnios),The Aegean,37.0,27.0,2003,9786,"485 . Kalymna (Kalymnios) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 00 , long. 27 . 00 . Size of territory: 2 ( 93 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is originally Κάλυδνα , ηasper (Hom. Il 2 . 677 ; Diod. 5 . 54 . 1 ; Steph. Byz. 350 . 6 ; cf. Segre in Tit. Cal. p. 2 ), from C4 Κάλυ µ να , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 99 ; Tit. Cal. x . 1 (C4 -C3 ); 1 B. 16 (C4 ); Strabo 10 . 5 . 19 ; Steph. Byz. 350 . 12 ). In Homer ( Il . 2 . 677 : νήσους τε Καλυacuteδνας ), and in a number of late interpretations of this line (Strabo 10 . 5 . 14 , 19 ; Eust. Il . 1 . 495 . 4 ff, 49612 ff; Hsch. Κ 527 ) the toponym occurs in the plural, and it seems reasonable to suppose that the islands in the vicinity of Kalymna were subsumed under the plural toponym Kalydnai, even if we cannot say for sure which islands were included.The contrast ATL finds in a Kalymnian inscription between the Kalydnian islands and the demos of the Kalymnians ( Tit. Cal. 64 (C3l) = Syll . 3 567 ; ATL cites SGDI iii 3586 ) rests on a false restoration; lines 9 -10 are better restored as επιgrave ταgraveν πόλιν καιgrave ταgraveν χώραν καιgrave ταgraveς νάσος ταgraveς Κα [ λυ µ νίων ] as proposed by Herzog ( 1902 ) 319 , who saw in the islands Pserimos, Telendos and other small islands near Kalymna. The city-ethnic was originally Καλυacuteδνιος ( IG i³ 261 . i . 10 ; Hdt. 7 . 99 . 2 ; Androtion ( FGrHist 324 ) fr. 27 ), from C4 Καλυacute µ νιος ( Tit. Cal. 1 (C4 ); Men. fr. 348 ). Kalymna is called a polis both in the urban sense ( Tit. Cal. 11 . 9 (C4 -C3 )) and in the political sense ( Tit. Cal. 7 . 15 -16 (C4l/C3e); I.Knidos 221 A. 6 -7 , 15 , 35 -36 , B 36 ( c. 300 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic appears internally in Kalymnian decrees of C4 ( Tit. Cal. 1 A-C) and externally in the Knidian arbitration between Kos (no. 497 ) and Kalymna ( I.Knidos 221 A. 15 ( c. 300 )) and in literary sources (Hdt. 7 . 99 . 2 ). The external and individual use of the ethnic is attested in the arbitration decree ( I.Knidos 221 B. 36 -37 ) and in a fragment of Menander (fr. 348 ). It is called patris in Tit. Cal. 235 (C5 ) and Tit. Cal no. x = CEG ii 716 (C4l/C3e). According to Hdt. 7 . 99 . 2 -3 , Kalymna was colonised by Epidauros (no. 348 ). Diodorus' version ( 5 . 54 . 3 ), which replaces Epidauros with Kos (no. 497 ), should almost certainly be seen as an invention related to the absorption of Kalymna by Kos in C3l ( Tit. Cal. xii ). Diodorus gives Thettalos, son of Herakles, as the oecist ( 5 . 54 . 1 ). Herodotos noted one or two warships of the Kalydnians under the command of Artemisia at Salamis ( 7 . 99 . 2 ). The Kalydnians were members of the Delian League. They belonged to the Karian district ( IG i³ 269 . v . 7 ) and are recorded in the tribute lists from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . i . 10 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 19 ) a total of fourteen times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 tal. 3 , 000 dr. down to 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . i . 55 ) and thereafter an unknown amount ( IG i³ 280 . i . 50 ). The Kalydnians were assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 148 ). It seems clear that here we have some kind of grouping around Kalymna to pay tribute,since there seems to be no evidence that the Kalydnai islands were a polis . On the other hand, some scholars have proposed that Kalymna hosted three poleis , none of which was called Kalymna.Bean and Cook (( 1957 ) 131 -33 ), following and systematising earlier suggestions, argue that Kalymna had three poleis , called Pothaia, located by modern Damos and encompassing the whole valley there, Orkatos, which would have occupied the region of modern Rina (Vathy) and its valley (cf. Newton ( 1865 ) i. 319 -20 ), and Panormos, located on the nearby island of Telendos, or possibly at Sykia. Our evidence for the organisation of these entities is Heltic, but it seems clear that by some point in C4 there was a Kalymnian polis , well attested epigraphically (see infra ; but see also Bean and Cook ( 1957 ) 131 -33 , who argue that there never was a single state called Kalymna on Kalymna). If there were in fact three poleis on Kalymna before c. C4m, which had formed some kind of synteleia with several of the smaller nearby islands to pay Athenian tribute in C5 , perhaps they, like Kos, may have undergone a synoecism at roughly the same time. In C4 the Kalymnians had a council ( boule ) ( Tit. Cal. 3 . 1 , 8 . 1 ) and an assembly, called ekklesia ( Tit. Cal. 1 A-B, 2 . 1 -2 , 3 . 2 ) or damos ( Tit. Cal. 7 . 3 , 8 . 1 ). Decrees ( psephismata ) were passed by the ekklesia ( Tit. Cal. 1 A-B, 2 . 1 -2 ) or by the boule and the damos ( Tit. Cal. 8 . 1 , 9 . 1 ) or by the damos alone ( Tit. Cal . 7 . 19 ); sometimes proposals were put forward by a board of prostatai ( Tit. Cal. 7 . 1 , 8 . 2 ), and sometimes they were brought forward on the motion of an individual ( Tit. Cal. 2 . 3 -4 , 3 . 3 ). Kalymna bestowed proxenia on citizens of Delphi (no. 177 ) ( Tit. Cal. 1 B),Sikyon (no. 228 ) ( Tit. Cal . 1 C),Athens (no. 361 ) and (the region of) Oita ( Tit. Cal. 3 ), and citizenship on citizens of Thera (no. 527 ) ( Tit. Cal. 8 ) and Miletos (no. 854 ) ( Tit. Cal. 7 . 23 ). The citizens were organised into tribes ( φυλαί ) and demes ( δαtilde µ οι ). In the Heltic period there were a minimum of five phylai and seven damoi (Jones, POAG 231 -36 ). The three ancient Doric phylai are attested in C2 ( Tit. Cal. 88 ), probably as a survival of a much earlier period. A citizenship decree of C4l/C3e stipulates that the new citizen be inscribed in the phyle called Περφίδαι and in the damos called Ποθαίων ( Tit. Cal . 8 . 20 -23 ; cf. 9 . 7 ). The names of two months are attested in C4 inscriptions ( Tit. Cal . 1 A-B); they show that the Kalymnian calendar was identical with that of Kos already in the Classical period (Trümpy, Monat . 179 -81 ). A late inscription attests directly to Apollo Delios as the chief deity ( Iscr. Cos EV 232 (first/second century ad ), but there is no doubt that he had served in this role earlier as well (see infra ). The site of the polis centre of Kalymna has not been identified with certainty, though it may well have occupied the site of the modern town of Embolos, which has produced remains of Classical and Heltic date as well as Roman period sigillata (Bean and Cook ( 1957 ) 128 -29 ). Others have suggested a site at Sykia (Maiuri ( 1925 -26 b ) 323 n. 1 , 'Periboli'). The main Kalymnian sanctuary was dedicated to Apollo ( Tit. Cal . 8 . 25 -26 ) and lay outside the putative polis centre. It was in use throughout the Archaic and Classical periods (Newton ( 1865 ) i. 304 -12 ). Near it was a theatre possibly antedating C3 ( TGR ii. 144 ). The territory of Kalymna included not only the island of the same name, but several neighbouring islands. Of these perhaps only Telendos, Kalinos and Pserimos were large enough to have been occupied permanently. On Telendos have been reported ruins of a theatre and other evidence of habitation (Segre ( 1944 -45 ) 219 ); Pserimos has yielded an inscription of (probably) third century ad , which confirms the island's toponym as Ψήρι µ ος ( Tit. Cal . 250 . 1 ). The C6 coins long attributed to Kalymna (Head, HN ² 631 ; Segre ( 1944 -45 ) 5 ) have now been dissociated from the island (Wartenberg ( 1998 ), unknown to Figueira ( 1998 ) 578 ), which leaves Kalymna to the best of my knowledge without coinage before the Heltic period. K arpathos (K arpathios ) Map 60 (inset). Lat. 35 . 25 -55 , long. 27 . 5 -15 . Size of territory: 4 ( 301 km ² , or, if Saros is included, 324 km ² ). The toponym is Κάρπαθος , ηasper (Hdt. 3 . 45 . 1 ; Diod. 20 . 93 . 2 ); the form Κράπαθος occurs in the Homeric Catalogue of Ships ( Il . 2 . 676 ). The toponym denotes both the island ( Hymn. Hom. Ap . 43 ; Diod. 5 . 54 . 4 ; Strabo 10 . 5 . 17 ; Steph. Byz. 361 . 8 ) and one of the towns on the island ( IG i³ 1454 . 35 -37 (C5s), see infra ). The regional ethnic is Καρπάθιος (Archil. fr. 248 ; Arist. Rhet . 1413 a 19 ; IG i³ 271 . i . 66 ); for Καρπάθιος as a city-ethnic, see infra . Ps.-Skylax 99 calls Karpathos tripolis , and the names of three poleis are attested independently, viz . Arkes(s)ia, Brykous and Karpathos ( infra ); but in C5 the island was also home to the semi-independent koinon of the Eteokarpathians ( infra ). Strabo ( 10 . 5 . 17 ), however, calls the island tetrapolis . This must reflect Strabo's confusion (Reger ( 1997 ) 453 ) and not the absorption of Saros as suggested by Susini ( 1963 -64 ) 245 (see under Saros for further discussion). Hsch. Κ 3967 speaks of Karpathos as νηtildeσον ' Ρόδου . The island was indeed incorporated by the Rhodians (no. 1000 ), but the date is not certain (Papachristodoulou ( 1989 ) 45 -46 ); some scholars see the incorporation as a process that occurred across C4 (Susini ( 1963 -64 ) 231 ). Karpathos had a sanctuary of Poseidon Porthmios, who was perhaps the guardian deity. Epigraphic evidence in the form of decrees published at the sanctuary belongs in the Heltic period ( IG xii . 1 1031 -37 ), but the archaeological record reaches back into the Archaic period (Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1962 ) 167 ), when the sanctuary must have been in the territory of Brykous. On Karpathos have been found remains of three settlements of the Archaic and Classical periods, one at modern Ag.Ioannis,identified with ancient Brykous, one at modern Arkassa, identified with ancient Arkessia, and one at modern Pegadi, identified with ancient Potidaion (Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1962 ) 158 ). The Athenian tribute lists record four communities on Karpathos as members of the Delian League: Arkesia, the Brykontioi, the Karpathioi and the Eteokarpathioi. A combination of the tribute lists with the other sources and the archaeological evidence results in the following reconstruction."
486,Arke(s)seia (Arkesieus),The Aegean,35.3,27.05,329,1488,"486 . Arke(s)seia (Arkesieus) Map 60 (inset). Lat. 35 . 30 , long. 27 . 05 . Size of territory: presumably 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Αρκέσεια , ηasper ( IG i³ 271 . i . 66 -67 ) or Αρκέσσεια ( IG i³ 272 . i . 77 ). The city-ethnic is Αρκασ ( ε ) ιευacuteς , attested in late sources only ( IG xii . 1 218 (Hell.), 990 (Roman)). Arkeseia is convincingly identified with modern Arkassa, where an abundance of sherds from the Geometric through the Heltic periods were found in and around an acropolis with walls of the late Classical or Heltic period enclosing an area of c. 1 . 5 ha (Della Seta ( 1924 -25 ) 91 -92 ; Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1962 ) 162 -63 ). It follows that Arkeseia is one of the three poleis referred to by tripolis at Ps.Skylax 99 and thus attested as a polis in the urban sense of the term. Arkeseia was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district ( IG i³ 269 . iv . 22 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 26 -27 ) to 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 3 ) a total of nine times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 26 -27 ). It is listed by toponym ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 49 : Αρ [ κέσσεια ]), usually specified as Καρπάθο Αρκέσσεια , that is,' Arkes(s)eia of Karpathos' ( IG i³ 272 . i . 77 ), or as Καρπαθίο [ ν ] Αρκέσεια , ' Arkeseia of the Karpathians'( IG i³ 271 . i . 66 -67 ). Since there seems to be no pattern to the use,no change in status should be inferred."
487,Brykous (Brykountios),The Aegean,35.5,27.1,491,2273,"487 . Brykous (Brykountios) Map 60 (inset). Lat. 35 . 50 , long. 27 . 10 . Size of territory: presumably 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Βρυκουtildeς , -ντος ( IG xii . 1 995 (first century ad ); IG i³ 282 . iv . 9 -10 , completely restored). The city-ethnic is Βρυκόντιος ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 139 ) or Βρυκουacuteντιος ( IG xii . 1 220 . 3 (Hell.); IG i³ 100 . ii . 4 , restored). Inscriptions ( IG xii . 1 994 -1009 (C2 and later)) secure identification with modern Ag. Ioannis, with remains from the Archaic through the late Roman period, including a city wall of the late Classical or Heltic period (Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1962 ) 161 -62 ), but Susini ( 1963 -64 ) 233 gives no date for the fortifications. It follows that Brykous is one of the three poleis referred to by tripolis at Ps.-Skylax 99 and thus attested as a polis in the urban sense of the term. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in late inscriptions ( IG xii . 1 994 -95 (first century ad )) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 139 ). The individual use is attested both internally ( IG xii . 1 1000 -9 ) and externally ( IG xii . 1 220 (Hell.)). Brykous was a member of the Delian League and is recorded in the tribute lists mostly by city-ethnic but once probably by toponym ( IG i³ 282 . iv . 9 -10 ) from 448 / 7 ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 17 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . iv . 9 -10 ) a total of three times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 500 dr. ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 17 ). Brykous is absent from the full panel of 441 / 0 ( IG i³ 271 . i -ii . 64 -86 ), and in 429 / 8 it paid the phoros of that year and the preceding year ( IG i³ 282 . iv . 9 -10 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 139 ) ( 500 dr.) and perhaps also in 410 / 9 ( IG i³ 100 . ii . 4 ). The sanctuary of Poseidon Porthmios was presumably in the territory of Brykous; perhaps Poseidon was the chief deity. Inscriptions starting in the Heltic period attest to a temple of Athena Lindia on the acropolis: that is, in the period when Karpathos was controlled by the Rhodians and formed part of the Rhodian state ( IG xii . 1 997 -98 ). On the unlikely possibility that the island of Saros was part of the territory of Brykous, see under Saros, infra ."
488,Eteokarpathioi,The Aegean,35.35,27.1,477,2322,"488 . Eteokarpathioi Map 60 (inset). Lat. 35 . 35 , long. 27 . 10 . Type: [A]. Since the Eteokarpathians were organised as a koinon ( IG i³ 1454 . 7 , 12 , restored), there is no toponym. The ethnic, attested only in the plural, is ' Ετεοκαρπάθιοι ( IG i³ 1454 . 6 , 11 , 21 , 28 ( 445 -430 )). In the Athenian tribute lists the Eteokarpathians are listed under the heading πόλεις αυταιgrave φόρον ταχσά µ εναι ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 76 -77 , 81 -82 ). C. 445 -430 the Athenians declared a Karpathian, his children and τοgrave ' Ετεοκαρπαθίων κοινόν as euergetai of the Athenians,and the koinon was declared autonomous ( IG i³ 1454 . 12 : [ α ] υτονό µ ος ). This inscription is said to have been found at Pini (see IG i³ p. 899 ), which is located in the south-central part of the island. If the inscription was found in situ , or at least near its original position, this site should then be that of the sanctuary of Apollo where the cypress was cut for Athena in Athens (for a copy of the inscription was to be erected εν Καρ [ πάθωι εν τῶι ] ιasperερῶι τ ˜ ο Απόλλ [ ωνος οasperacuteθεν ] ετ µ ήθη ηasper κυπάρι [ ττος ] ( IG i³ 1454 35 -37 ) (for the view that the tree was used on Karpathos, not in Athens,see Alfieri Tonini ( 1999 )). No material earlier than the Heltic period seems, however, to have been reported (Leekley and Noyes ( 1975 ) 27 ). Sites in the general region with Archaic and/or Classical period remains have been suggested as villages of the Eteokarpathians (Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1962 ) 163 -65 ). After the Eteokarpathians had been declared autonomous, they appear in the Athenian tribute lists among the poleis that voluntarily paid phoros ( πόλεις αυταιgrave φόρον ταχσά µ εναι ), viz . in the years 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 14 ), 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 81 -82 ) and 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . ii . 75 , restored). Thereafter they appear twice as regular members of the League, in 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 1 ) and in 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 23 ). The Eteokarpathians seem to have had no separate city, but a separate organisation ( ATL i. 497 ), probably set up by the Athenians as a short-lived splinter community of Karpathos. There is no trace of their existence after C5 . Thus, they are not likely to have been one of the three poleis on Karpathos recorded by Ps.-Skylax in C4s."
489,Karpathos (Karpathios),The Aegean,,,735,3582,"489 . Karpathos (Karpathios) Map 60 (inset). Unlocated, not in Barr . Type: A. The toponym is Κάρπαθος ( IG i³ 1454 . 35 -37 : εγ Καρ [ πάθωι εν τῶι ] ιasperερῶι τ ˜ ο Απόλλ [ ωνος ], probably referring to a site on Karpathos and not to the island as a whole, c. 445 -430 , see now Alfieri Tonini ( 1999 ). The city-ethnic is Καρπάθιος ( IG i³ 1454 . 5 ), recorded in, e.g., the Athenian tribute list of 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 5 ) alongside the Eteokarpathians ( iii . 1 ) and Arkeseia on Karpathos ( iii . 2 -3 ), which 'implies a geographical unit less than the entire island for Καρπάθιοι alone' ( ATL i. 497 ). It follows that Karpathos is one of the three poleis referred to by tripolis at Ps.-Skylax 99 and thus attested as a polis in the urban sense of the term. The external use of the city-ethnic is attested collectively in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 269 . iv . 19 ) and individually in an Athenian honorific decree ( IG i³ 1454 . 5 ). Karpathos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district ( IG i³ 269 .IV. 19 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 445 / 4 ( IG i³ 267 . iii . 23 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 5 ) a total of nine times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 267 . iii . 23 ), raised to 1 , 500 dr. in or before 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 5 ). The urban centre of the Karpathioi remains unidentified (Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1962 ) 164 -65 suggests a site near modern Aperi, but see Susini ( 1963 -64 ) 232 -33 ). A stater attributed to Karpathos was found in a hoard dated to c. 375 ( IGCH 1790 ). In, probably, the territory of Karpathos, at modern Pegadi, are the remains of 'a sizeable classical town . . . convincingly identified with Potidaion' (Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1962 ) 159 ). The toponym is Ποτίδαιον , τό ( I.Lindos p. 1009 , l. 25 (Maier ( 1959 -61 ) i. 188 -91 no. 50 ) (C2m); Ποσείδιον πόλις in Ptol. Geog . 5 . 2 . 33 ). The ethnic is Ποτιδαιευacuteς ( I . Lindos p. 1009 , ll. 31 -32 (Maier ( 1959 -61 ) i. 188 -91 no. 50 ), C2m). Our written sources for this place are all post-Classical and refer to the κτοίνα of the Potidaieis when it was part of the Rhodian state. Because Potidaion does not appear in the Athenian tribute lists, it has been taken to be the polis centre of the Eteokarpathioi (Head, HN ² 631 ; but see infra ). Others have seen it as the port ( epineion ) of the Karpathioi (so Hiller von Gaertringen in IG xii . 1 p. 158 , followed by Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1962 ) 159 ). But given the lateness of our sources, it is difficult to be confident that this entity existed before the Heltic period, and in any case it is not needed to make up the number of poleis attested by Ps.-Skylax. Perhaps the best solution is to connect it, as Hiller von Gaertringen does, with the Karpathioi, who otherwise have no obvious civic centre, and who-if they reappear as the Rhodian deme of the Καρπαθιοπολῖται in the Heltic period, as seems very likely-are closely associated in our epigraphical evidence with the ktoina of the Potidaieis (see, e.g., I . Lindos p. 1009 ; Susini ( 1963 -64 ) 231 ). The acropolis of Potidaion has walls that have been attributed to C4 , and it has yielded pottery of Classical date (Melas ( 1991 ) M-25 ). The coins long attributed to this city (silver staters with obv . three dolphins; rev . incuse square) in fact belong elsewhere (Cahn ( 1957 ), and already Hiller von Gaertringen in IG xii . 1 p. 158 ). The Elmali hoard, which was buried in C5m, is said to contain a Karpathian coin (Figueira ( 1998 ) 578 )."
490,Kasos (Kasios),The Aegean,35.25,27.0,1939,9000,"490 . Kasos (Kasios) Map 60 (inset). Lat. 35 . 25 , long. 27 . 00 . Size of territory: 2 ( 69 km ² ). Type: [A]. The toponym is Κάσος , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 676 ; Ps.-Skylax 99 emended by Voss, MSS Κράσος ; Steph.Byz. 364 . 3 ; Hsch. Κ 977 ), denoting both the island and the town (Strabo 10 . 5 . 18 ). The city-ethnic is Κάσιος ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 83 ; IG xi . 2 199 .B. 14 ). In the Athenian tribute lists of 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 5 -6 , 11 ) and 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 76 -77 , 83 ) the Kasioi are recorded under the heading πόλες αυταιgrave φόρον ταχσά µ εναι . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( supra ). Steph. Byz. 364 . 3 catalogues the island among the Kyklades. The islands around Kasos, the Κασίων νηtildeσοι (Strabo 10 . 5 . 18 ), were part of its territory. Kasos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian-Karian district ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 4 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . ci . 11 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 6 ) a total of six times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 83 ). The presence of Kasian theoroi on Delos in 274 provides a terminus post quem for the absorption of Kasos by the Rhodians ( IG xi . 2 199 .B. 14 with Fraser and Bean ( 1954 ) 152 ; Papachristodoulou ( 1989 ) 48 ). The urban centre and its harbour were connected by an ancient road (Susini ( 1963 -64 ) 206 ). A sanctuary of Apollo Temenitas is attested from the Heltic period ( I.Cret . I xxii 4 .C. xii . I. 66 -69 ; cf. Susini ( 1963 -64 ) 211 ). Otherwise, physical remains are sparse; see Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1962 ) 168 . K eos (K eios ) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 24 . 20 . Size of territory: 3 ( 159 km ² ). The toponym is Κέος (Bacchyl. Epin . 6 . 5 ; Hdt. 8 . 76 . 1 ) or Κέως , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 58 ; IG ii² 404 . 6 -7 (C4s)). The ethnic is Κεῖος ( IG xii . 5 594 . 7 ) or Κήιος ( CID ii 6 .B. 10 -26 ). Strabo, quoting Artemidoros, places Keos among the Kyklades (Strabo 10 . 5 . 3 ). Keos had four poleis (Ps.-Skylax 58 : τετράπολις ). Harpokration s.v. Κεῖοι quotes Lysias (fr. 96 , Sauppe) for referring to Keos as being one polis : ' οιasper Κεῖοι µ εgraveν πόλις τοσαυacuteτη ' . Harpokration notes the anomaly and takes polis to be used synonymously with nesos : τηgraveν νηtildeσον δεgrave πόλιν ωνό µ ασεν οasper ρasperήτωρ . But Lysias' use of the ethnic instead of the toponym indicates that the reference is to Keos as a kind of political community ( CPCActs 5 : 126 -27 ). The individual use of the ethnic is attested internally in C4 decrees ( SEG 14 531 . 7 ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ) and in the C4lists of the Delian Amphiktyony ( I.Délos 98 .A. 12 = IG ii² 1635 . 113 ( 377 / 6 )). The individual and external use is attested in an Athenian list of crews of ships of 405 ( IG i³ 1032 . vi . 72 -82 ) and in Delphic inscriptions ( CID ii 4 . iii . 40 and 6 .B. 10 -26 ). In the accounts of the Delphian naopoioi we find Κεῖος εξ ' Ιουλίδος ( CID ii 12 . i . 33 ) and Κεῖος εξ Καρθαίας ( CID ii 12 . i . 1 ) alongside the simple Κεῖος ( CID ii 17 ), also attested in a Delphic proxeny decree of C4l ( SEG 31 536 ). This probably reflects the federation (cf. Reger and Risser ( 1991 ) 316 -17 ). It is not always easy to distinguish between the use of the island ethnic Κεῖος ( IG xii . 5 594 . 7 = SEG 14 531 ) or Κήιος ( CID ii 6 . 10 -26 ) to designate merely 'a person from Keos' (without reference to his or her polis of origin) and its use to denote 'a citizen of (one of) the Keian federation(s)' of three of the four poleis in C5 and C4 (cf. Reger ( 1997 ) 474 and infra ). 'Keios' probably means 'from the island of Keos' , in Bacchylides ( Epigr . 1 . 4 : Κήϊος ; 17 . 130 : Κήϊοι ), in the expression Κηία φλυαρία in Timokreon ( 10 . 1 -2 West (C5f)), and in the Parian Chronicle mentioning Simonides as a Keian ( IG xii . 5 444 . 70 ( FGrHist 239 )). Cf. also the Keians in Plato: Simonides, Prodikos and Pythokleides (Pl. Hipparch . 228 C; Ap . 19 E; Prt . 314 C (all rC5 )), as again in the Athenian list of crews ( IG i³ 1032 . vi . 72 -82 ) or in the victor lists for the Olympic, Nemean and Isthmian Games ( Olympionikai 116 ( 540 ), 203 ( 480 ), 288 ( 452 )). But when Herodotos speaks of the Hestiatorion of the Keians on Delos ( 4 . 35 . 4 ) (the building has not been identified: see Bruneau and Ducat ( 1983 ) 160 ), a building publicly dedicated to Apollo, it is far more likely that he wants his reader to understand that a political body, 'the Keians' , dedicated it. Moreover, Herodotos has the Keians supply two ships at Artemision (Hdt. 8 . 1 . 2 ) and seven at Salamis (Hdt. 8 . 46 . 2 ). The Keians are recorded on the Serpent Column commemorating the victory at Plataiai (ML 27 . 7 ), and at Olympia after the Persian War (Paus. 5 . 23 . 2 ). The Keians were members of the Delian League, and may have been among the original members ( ATL iii. 198 -99 ). They belonged to the Island district ( IG i³ 270 . v . 23 ) and are recorded in the tribute lists from 451 / 50 ( IG i³ 262 . v . 22 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 13 ) a total of thirteen times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of at first more than 1 tal. ( IG i³ 262 . v . 22 ), raised to 4 tal. in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 21 ), reduced to 3 tal. in 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . i . 74 ), but raised again to 6 tal. in 417 / 16 ( IG i³ 288 . i . 10 ). They were assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 69 ) ( 10 tal.) and in 410 / 9 ( IG i³ 100 .I i . 3 ). They are recorded among the paying members in 413 (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 4 ). Although the most recent study of Keian coinage assigns no coins with the legend ΚΕΙ ( ΩΝ ) to before the end of C4 (Papageorgiadou-Banis ( 1997 ) 43 ; but cf. Sheedy ( 1998 b )), this need mean only that a C5federation did not issue coins. Archaic coins minted by Ioulis, Karthaia and Koresia have a dolphin alongside the individual type of each polis ( infra 749 , 750 and 751 ). On balance the evidence strongly suggests, as already argued by Brun ( 1989 ), that the Keian poleis created in C5 a federal state of some kind with ties between the participant poleis that reached beyond merely joint payment of a phoros to Athens. In C4 under the heading Κείων , the Ioulitai, Karthaieis and Koresioi are listed individually as members of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 B. 23 -26 ); the Poiessians are recorded separately (l. 82 ). Two isopoliteiai agreements between the Keians and the Euboian cities of Histiaia (no. 372 ) ( SEG 14 . 531 = improved text of IG xii . 5 594 = Tod 141 ) and Eretria (no. 370 ) ( SEG 14 530 ), both of perhaps c. 364 (cf. Brun ( 1989 ) 124 ), show that at least the three usual Keian poleis formed a federation again at this time: there was a common citizenship for all Keians, and the citizens were subdivided into phylai , trittyes and choroi ( χῶροι ) (Jones, POAG 203 -4 ). A common boule and boards of thesmophylakes , probouloi and astynomoi are also attested. According to Heracl. Lemb. 28 , quoting Aristotle, the Keians passed a law ( nomos ) forbidding girls and boys from drinking wine (cf. Villard ( 1997 )); but he also says ( 26 ) that Keos was settled by one Keos from Naupaktos (no. 165 ), a story which may owe its origins to Keian relations with that town in C3 (see IG xii . 5 527 ); otherwise the best ancient testimony agrees that the Keians were Ionians from Athens (Hdt. 8 . 46 ; Thuc. 7 . 57 . 4 ; schol. Dionys.Perig. 525 , giving Thersidamas as the leader). Ioulis seems to have been the capital of the federation. The Keians appear as debtors on Delos in 377 / 6 ( I.Délos 98 .A. 12 ). An Aristotelian Constitution of the Keians is attested (Heracl.Lemb. 26 -29 ). Lys. fr. 96 indicates that the federation was formed before c. 380 , and it may go back to 411 (D. M. Lewis ( 1962 ) 3 -4 ). The Keians defected from the Athenian League in 364 but were subdued by a squadron under Chabrias and forced to dissolve the federation ( IG ii² 111 = Tod 142 ). The injunction to remain as separate poleis is repeated in a decree of 354 -338 ( IG ii² 404 . 13 -14 with Dreher ( 1985 ) 268 ; for the date, see Hansen ( 1984 ) 125 n. 6 ). Again, in the list of recipients of grain from Kyrene c. 330 ( SEG 9 2 ), Ioulis, Koresia and Karthaia are listed individually alongside an amount to the Keians as such ( 45 , 51 -55 ); Ruschenbusch ( 1982 ) 183 argues that the Poiessians are inadvertently omitted after the Keians; contra Brun ( 1989 ) 137 . It has been suggested that IG xii . 5 609 was a list of citizens of a C4l sympoliteia between Ioulis and Koresia (Ruschenbusch ( 1982 ); see still D. M. Lewis ( 1962 )). Poiessa seems never to have participated in any of these federal states (Phylarchos, FHG 1 . 346 ; Brun ( 1989 ) 131 -32 ). Trümpy, Monat . 55 -60 argues that the calendars of all four Keian poleis must have been identical, but the evidence to support this is slim."
491,Ioulis (Ioulietes),The Aegean,37.4,24.2,1273,6193,"491 . Ioulis (Ioulietes) Map 57 . Lat. 37 . 40 , long. 24 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 ( c. 47 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is ' Ιουλίς , ηasper ( CID ii 12 . ii . 30 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ιουλιήτης ( IG ii² 43 B 24 ; as Ιολιήτης in IG ii² 1128 . 25 = Ro 40 ) or (once) Ουλιάτης ( SEG 9 2 . 45 , but the ethnics in this inscription are generally odd). Ioulis is referred to as a polis in the urban sense by the term τετράπολις at Ps.-Skylax 58 . It is called polis in the political sense in IG ii² 111 . 6 = Tod 142 , and in the territorial sense (city plus hinterland) in SEG 14 . 532 . 3 = Migeotte ( 1992 ) no . 56 (C4l/C3e). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested both externally ( IG ii² 43 .B 24 ; SEG 9 2 . 45 ) and internally ( IG ii² 1128 . 25 ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is probably attested in a Delian inscription of 301 ( IG xi . 2 146 . 45 ). For a later unquestionable attestation, see I.Délos 2634 . 17 (C2 ), with SEG 45 1049 for the date. A fragmentary C4m list of citizens (or rather citizens fit for military service) must originally have recorded about 480 names, corresponding to a citizenry of about 700 adult males and a population of roughly 3 , 500 persons ( IG xii . 5 609 ; see Ruschenbusch ( 1982 ); Cherry, Davis and Mantzourani ( 1991 ) 236 -37 ; Hansen ( 1997 ) 28 -29 with n. 147 ; Brun ( 1989 ) 126 -27 for the date). The citizens were organised into seven phylai , of which the names of four are preserved: Leodai, Hylichidai, Thyssidai and Koresioi. The presence of the Koresioi shows that in this period Koresia had already been turned into a subdivision of Ioulis (but this absorption did not last, since Koresia appears once again in the Heltic period as an independent polis before Ioulis finally absorbs it; see Reger ( 1998 )). The number of adult male citizens of Ioulis before the incorporation of Koresia comes to c. 550 and the population to c. 2 , 500 persons. ' Υλιχίδης is attested as a sub-ethnic in an undated sepulchral inscription: IG xii . 5 637 (Jones, POAG 204 -6 ). In C4l/C3e the citizens were further subdivided in units called κοινεῖα ( SEG 14 532 . 16 -17 ). Ioulis occupied the north-eastern quadrant of the island and bordered on the territories of Koresia and Karthaia ( infra ). Its harbour ( limen ) ( IG ii² 1128 . 38 ) lay at Otzias, where recent work has revealed the traces of docks and other facilities (Spondyles ( 1998 )). The river Elixos (Strabo 10 . 5 . 6 ) rose near Ioulis and flowed down into the sea by Koresia. The approximate boundaries of Ioulis can be worked out on the basis of topography and some of the sites that recent intensive fieldwork by several teams have discovered (see generally Reger ( 1998 ) and the map at Cherry, Davis and Mantzourani ( 1991 ) 6 ). The eponymous official was an archon, known first from Heltic texts ( IG xii . 5 610 . 1 (C3l), 597 with Mendoni ( 1989 ) 292 -95 no. ii (C3 ), 595 (C3 -C2 )).As early as C5s, however, we hear of a boule and a demos meeting in an ekklesia ( IG xii . 5 593 .B. 1 -3 , C. 1 ). Other C4 officials include a board of, probably, five strategoi ( IG ii² 111 . 15 -17 ), a board of judicial officials called prostatai ( IG ii² 1128 . 36 ) and a grammateus ( SEG 14 532 . 18 ). The references to Thesmophylakes and a grammateus may be C4 or C3e ( IG xii . 5 595 B; SEG 14 532 ). Laws ( nomoi ) and decrees were passed by the boule and the ekklesia ( IG xii . 5 593 (C5 ); IG ii² 1128 (C4m)). Of public enactments preserved in inscriptions the most notable is the C5s law on burial rites and customs ( IG xii . 5 . 593 ; cf. SEG 45 2263 ). In connection with the abortive revolt against Athens in the 360 s, the death penalty and confiscation of property were imposed on pro-Athenian citizens, and the Ioulitai murdered the citizen who served as Athenian proxenos ( IG ii² 111 ). The protective deity was certainly Apollo Pythios (cf. IG ii² 111 . 22 ). Other communal cults include Athena ( IG xii . 5 611 (C6 -C5 )). The month of Hermaion is attested ( IG ii² 1128 ; Trümpy, Monat . 55 ). The urban centre lay inland at modern Chora,about 3 km from the coast.Part of the C5 acropolis fortification wall still exists (Welter ( 1954 ) 71 -74 ). The walls were repaired in C4l/C3e ( SEG 14 532 = Migeotte ( 1992 )no. 56 ). In C4 inscriptions are mentioned a prytaneion ( IG ii² 1128 . 34 -35 ), a sanctuary of Apollo Pythios where many public documents were inscribed ( IG ii² 111 . 22 ; IG xii . 5 1102 = Migeotte ( 1984 ) no. 63 (C4 -C3 ); cf. Welter ( 1954 ) 74 -78 ), and a Lykeion ( SEG 14 532 . 19 ). A theatre is attested for C3 ( IG xii . 5 597 . 8 ). A sanctuary of Zeus Ikmaios may have stood on the border between Ioulis and Karthaia ( IG xii . 5 543 ; K. Manthos ( 1991 ) 62 -63 with 135 n. 328 ; Bürchner ( 1921 ) 186 ; for sacrifices by Aristaios to Zeus on Keos, see Theophr. De vent. 14 ). Within the territory of Ioulis K. Manthos believed he had identified a sanctuary of Aphrodite, but this has been doubted (Manthos ( 1991 ) 46 with Mendoni's comments at 119 n. 179 ); two other sanctuaries have been identified archaeologically but not assigned to deities (Georgiou and Faraklas ( 1985 ) nos. 18 . 08 , 13 . 06 ). Miltos , which figured so importantly in relations with Athens in C4 (and undoubtedly earlier as well), was mined at two or more sites in the territory of Ioulis (Georgiou and Faraklas ( 1985 ) no. 17 . 04 ; Mendoni ( 1985-86 ) 181 -82 ), and the Ioulietan decree on the export of miltos refers to the harbour ( limen ) of the city ( IG ii² 1128 . 38 ). Ioulis struck coins of silver and bronze from C6m onward. The most recent study of Keian coins assigns four series of silver coins to Ioulis in C6 -C4 . ( 1 ) Silver on the Aiginetan standard. Types: obv . bunch of grapes; rev . incuse square. ( 2 )-( 3 ) Silver, c. 520 -480 and after 480 . Types: obv . grapes, or dolphin; rev . incuse square. ( 4 ) Silver, C4 . Types: obv . Zeus Aristaieus; rev . bee, or head of Sirius. Ioulis may also have struck a bronze coinage in C4 . Types: obv . Zeus Aristaieus; rev . bee; legend: ΙΟΥ or ΙΟΥΛΙΕ (Head, HN ² 484 ; Papageorgiadou-Banis ( 1997 ) 25 -27 ; SNG Cop. ArgolisAegean Islands 646 -49 )."
492,Karthaia (Karthaieus),The Aegean,37.35,24.2,883,4118,"492 . Karthaia (Karthaieus) Map 57 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 24 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 ( c. 67 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Κάρθαια , ηasper (Pind. Pae . 4 . 13 -14 ; CID ii 12 . ii . 66 (C4s)). The city-ethnic is Καρθαιευacuteς ( IG ii² 43 .B. 25 ); the dative plural Καρθαέσσι is attested at SEG 9 2 . 51 . Karthaia is referred to as a polis in the urban sense by the term τετράπολις at Ps.Skylax 58 (for MS Αῖραι , read Καρθαία ). It is called polis in the political sense in several C4s decrees ( IG xii . 5 528 . 2 -3 , 5 ; 537 . 6 -7 ; 538 . 6 , dates: Brun ( 1989 ) 126 -28 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic can be found internally on Karthaian coins ( infra ) and decrees ( IG xii . 5 528 . 4 ) and externally in C4 Athenian decrees ( IG ii² 43 .B. 25 , 111 . 54 ). The individual and external use is first attested in a C3f proxeny decree from Delos ( IG xi . 4 592 . 3 -4 , 12 ). In C3 , and presumably in C4 as well, the citizens were organised into phylai and oikoi ( IG xii . 5 540 . 15 ; see Jones, POAG 206 ). The eponymous official was the archon ( IG xii . 5 544 .A 1 . 8 , 12 (C4 -C3 ); cf. also 552 ). Other officials attested in Classical sources are a board of, probably three, strategoi ( IG xii . 5 544 .A 1 . 15 -19 , A 2 . 11 -15 , 19 -23 ) and envoys ( presbeis ) sent to Karystos ( IG xii . 5 537 . 2 ). Decrees were passed by the boule and the demos on the motion of an individual ( IG xii . 5 537 . 1 , 528 , 538 with add.(C4 /C3 )). Public enactments preserved on inscriptions include an undated and rather obscure sacred law ( IG xii . 5 530 ) and a regulation about a spring in the sanctuary of Demeter of C4l ( IG xii . 5 569 ). Public enactments were set up in the sanctuary of Apollo ( IG xii . 5 528 . 16 , 538 . 12 ). Particularly important is a fragmentary C4m list of Karthaian proxenoi comprising a total of 110 + proxenoi in, probably, 50 + different poleis ( IG xii . 5 542 ). The protective deity was probably Apollo ( IG xii . 5 544 , found inter rudera templi Apollinis ), whose temple as Pythios dates from about C6l (Mendoni ( 1985 -86 ) 163 -65 ). Public cults of him ( IG xii . 5 545 (C4 )) and Hestia, or possibly private, ( IG xii . 5 554 (C5 )) are known before Alexander. An official has left a dedication to Aphrodite, which probably dates from C4 ( IG xii . 5 552 with Mitsos ( 1957 ) 164 no. 1 and BE ( 1962 ) 264 ) and an hieron of Hermes is mentioned in an inscription ( IG xii . 5 553 ). The temple of Athena, which was rebuilt in C4 (Mendoni ( 1990 )), dates originally from C6l (Mendoni ( 1985 -86 ) 161 ); see also the construction history of both temples in Papanikolaou ( 1998 ). We hear also of a sanctuary of Demeter ( IG xii . 5 569 (C4l), with Graindor ( 1905 ) 333 -37 ); that to Hermes is mentioned in an undated inscription ( IG xii . 5 553 ). The site of the town has long been known, on the east coast at one of the island's best anchorages, with a productive plain that stretches out at the mouth of the river that flows down off the Keian plateau.The town walls were probably demolished by Chabrias in 364 , but with the Athenians' permission the Karthaians were thereafter allowed to restore a rather slim defence circuit, probably as protection against pirates ( IG ii² 404 (C4s), with Maier ( 1959 -61 ) no. 37 ; cf. also Maier ( 1958 )). A prytaneion was present by C5 ( IG xii . 5 1060 . 2 ). For the temple of Apollo,which sits on a little acropolis jutting out from the surrounding rock, see supra . Karthaia struck coins of silver and bronze from C6s onwards. Four series of coins seem to belong to the Archaic and Classical periods. ( 1 )-( 2 ) The first series seems to start c. 510 (or 530 at the earliest), the second by c. 500 , though there are problems with both the attributions of the coins and the dates.

Cherry, Davis and Mantzourani ( 1991 ) 235 ). Type: A. The toponym appears variously as Κορησία , ηasper ( IG xii . 5 647 . 11 (C3e)) and Κορησσία (Ps.Skylax 58 ; Strabo 10 . 5 . 6 ). The only attestation of Κορησσός referring to the polis on Keos is in a spurious letter (Aeschin. Ep . 1 . 1 ). For the distinction between Κορησ ( σ ) ία on Keos and Κορησσός in Asia Minor, see L. Robert ( 1960 a ) 144 -45 . The city-ethnic is Κορήσιος ( SEG 9 2 . 55 ( c. 330 )). Koresia is referred to as a polis in the urban sense by the term τετράπολις at Ps.-Skylax 58 . It is called polis in the political sense in an inscription recording a series of loans extended to the polis by'the god' ,probably Apollo: εδάνεισεν οasper θεοgraveς τε [ ῖ πό ] λει ( IG xii suppl. 236 ; cf. SEG 39 873 (C4 ); but Migeotte ( 1984 ) 156 n. 32 assigns this inscription possibly to Karthaia). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins in abbreviated form ( infra ) and in inscriptions ( IG ii² 1128 . 12 ), and externally in inscriptions ( IG ii² 43 .B. 26 ; SEG 9 2 . 55 ). The earliest individual and external use of the cityethnic is in a C3 decree of Karthaia ( IG xii . 5 531 ). AnArchaic inscription in the Eretrian alphabet has sometimes been cited as evidence of Eretrian domination ( IG xii . 5 649 ; see LSAG 297 -98 with 648 by lapsus). Koresia was a member of the Delian League. In their first appearance in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 262 . i . 21 ), the Koresians are recorded separately from the Keians ( IG i³ 262 . v . 22 ); later they are subsumed under a synteleia ( supra 748 ). In the list of members of the Second Athenian League they appear as Keians along with the Ioulietai and the Karthaians ( IG ii² 43 .B. 23 -26 ). Koresia was undoubtedly a member of the Keian Federation, dissolved by the Athenians in 362 ( IG ii² 1128 and 404 ; see supra ). Koresia was incorporated into Ioulis for a while in C4s ( IG xii . 5 609 . 175 ), but was again a separate polis in C3 until finally completely absorbed by Ioulis (Strabo 10 . 5 . 6 ; Reger ( 1998 )). In C4s Koresia may have been both a dependent polis and a phyle of Ioulis. For the double status as dependent polis and civic subdivision of a major polis , see Hansen ( 1997 ) 37 . But its status as an independent polis in C3 -C2follows not only from the evidence of its inscriptions-which could be compatible with a status of dependent polis ( IG xii . 5 647 . 9 ; SEG 14 541 ; PEP Chios 51 )-but also from its status as the chief station of the Ptolemaic fleet in C3 , when it was renamed Arsinoe and is attested operating as an independent polis as late as c. 207 (Davis and Cherry ( 1991 ); L. Robert ( 1960 a ); I.Magnesia 50 ). Decrees were passed by the boule and the demos ( IG ii² 1128 . 9 , where the restoration of τῶι δή µ ωι in l. 9 is virtually certain).Public enactments were set up in the sanctuary of Apollo (ibid. ll. 15 -16 ), which is probably the sanctuary of Apollo Smintheus attested by Strabo 10 . 5 . 6 . A board of astynomoi (l. 17 ) and a dikasterion (l. 18 ) are known from the same inscription and likewise a prytaneion (l. 24 ). In C4l Koresia seems to have had some 154 citizens fit for military service, corresponding to c. 230 adult male citizens and a total population of c. 1 , 200 persons ( IG xii . 5 609 . 175 ff) (see Ruschenbusch ( 1982 ); Cherry, Davis and Mantzourani ( 1991 ) 236 -37 ; Hansen ( 1997 ) 28 -29 with n. 147 ). The urban centre, located on the hill above the present harbour town, has been thoroughly studied (Cherry, Davis and Mantzourani ( 1991 ) 265 -81 ). Koresia was permitted to restore its walls after the revolt of the 360 s and 350 s ( IG ii² 404 . 16 = Maier ( 1959 -61 ) no. 37 and Maier ( 1958 )). The northern part is preserved, and the circuit may have enclosed an area of c. 18 ha (Cherry, Davis and Mantzourani ( 1991 ) 236 ). The countryside was full of structures during the Archaic and Classical periods, but most of the population lived in the urban centre (Cherry, Davis and Mantzourani ( 1991 ) 327 -47 , esp. 337 ). Koresia struck silver coins from C6e to c. 480 . Three series of coins have been assigned to Koresia.Types: obv . cuttlefish, or dolphin and cuttlefish, or dolphin; legend: /Koppa or /Koppaο ; rev . incuse square; legend: Κ (third series only). The identification and dating remain somewhat problematic. No C4 issues are assigned till the end of the century (Head, HN ² 483 -84 ; Papageorgiadou-Banis ( 1997 ) 19 -21 ; SNG Cop. Argolis-Aegean Islands 637 -41 )."
494,Poiessa (Poiessios),The Aegean,37.35,24.25,569,2667,"494 . Poiessa (Poiessios) Map 57 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 24 . 25 . Size of territory: 2 ( c. 30 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is variously reported as Ποιηtildeσσα , ηasper ( IG xii . 5 1076 . 53 (C4 -C3 )) or Ποιήεσσα (Strabo 10 . 5 . 6 ) or Ποιαtildeσσα ( IG xii . 5 568 . 10 (C5 )). The city-ethnic is Ποιήσσιος ( IG ii² 43 . 82 ) or Ποιάσσιος ( IG xii . 5 568 . 1 (C5 )). That Poiessa is a polis in the urban sense is implied by the term τετράπολις at Ps.-Skylax 58 . It is called polis in the political sense in a decree of C4l-C3e ( IG xii . 5 570 .A 7 ); for the date see Brun ( 1996 ) 114 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in inscriptions of C5l/C4e ( IG xii . 5 568 . 1 , 1100 . 1 ) and external- ly in Athenian inscriptions ( IG ii² 43 . 82 ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is unattested. A text inscribed in stoichedon strongly suggests that the chief official was the prytanis (Mendoni ( 1989 ) 295 -96 no. III). In C4l/C3e decrees were passed by the boule and the demos ; a board of praktores is also mentioned ( IG xii . 5 570 .A 1 , B 2 ). By C5l there was a sanctuary of Apollo Pythios, a Pythion ( IG xii . 5 1100 , see also 571 i ); he may well have been the protective deity. Public enactments were set up in the sanctuary ( IG xii . 5 1100 . 7 -9 (C5 )). A dedication of C5 is made to Apollo without epithet (Dunant and Thomopoulos ( 1954 ) 346 -48 no. 17 = SEG 14 . 547 ). But there is also evidence of a temple dedicated to Apollo Smintheus within the territory of Poiessa ( IG xii . 5 1101 with Graindor ( 1903 ) 290 ; Galani et al . ( 1982 -84 ) 242 ). An individual who served in a public office ( arxas ) made a dedication (C5 ? C4 ?) to Hermes Prytaneios (Mendoni ( 1989 ) 295 -96 no. III). Strabo mentions a sanctuary of Athena Nedousia ( 10 . 5 . 6 ). Communal cults of Apollo Melanthios ( IG xii . 5 1101 (undated)) and an Apollo without epithet (and so perhaps Pythios?, SEG 14 . 547 (C5 )) are attested. Poiessa was probably among the Keian cities permitted to restore their fortification walls in the period 354 -338 ( IG ii² 404 with Maier ( 1959 -61 ) no. 37 and Maier ( 1958 )). Remains of city walls have been dated as starting in C6l (Galani et al . ( 1982 -84 ) 239 ). If correctly restored by Müller, Ps.-Skylax 58 refers to Poiessa's harbour. The approximate boundaries of its territory have been worked out (see Papageorgiadou-Banis ( 1999 ) 161 fig. 1 ). The territory is referred to as Ποιασσίων ηasper γηtilde ( IG xii . 5 568 . 1 , 1100 . 1 ). For the boundary, see Galani et al . ( 1982 -84 ) 238 ). No coins are known (see Papageorgiadou-Banis ( 1997 ) 51 -52 re a false attribution)."
495,Keria (Keraitas),The Aegean,36.55,25.4,145,714,"495 . Keria (Keraitas) Map 61 . Lat. 36 . 55 , long. 25 . 40 . Size of territory: 1 ( 15 km ² ). Type: C. Κερία , ηasper ( IG i³ 71 . i . 86 ). In Stadiasmus 282 Κέρεια is an emendation of MSS ΚΟΡΣΙΑ . The city-ethnic is Κεραιdieresisacuteτας ( I.Cret . iv 206 K (C3 -C2 )). The Kerians were assessed for tribute by the Athenians in 425 / 4 ( supra ), apparently 13 dr., but the entry is exceptional in being the only one in which the sum is recorded to the right of the toponym/ethnic. In the Heltic period a Kerian citizen received proxenia from Gortyns (no. 960 ) on Crete ( supra ). Despite the lack of explicit attestation, it seems reasonable to infer that Keria was possibly a polis in the Classical period."
496,Kimolos (Kimolios),The Aegean,36.45,24.3,491,2218,"496 . Kimolos (Kimolios) Map 58 . Lat. 36 . 45 , long. 24 . 30 . Size of territory: 2 ( 36 km ² ). Type: B. The toponym is Κί µ ωλος , ηasper (Strabo 10 . 5 . 1 ; IG i³ 71 . i . 89 ; F.Delphes iii . 1 497 . 12 (C4l/C3e)). The city-ethnic is Κι µ ώλιος ( IG i³ 289 . i . 18 ; perhaps also at 1032 . 87 , where Osborne and Byrne ( 1996 ) 123 suggest reading Κι µ ώ &lt; λι &gt;( ος ) instead of Κί µ ων ). There is no explicit Classical attestation of Kimolos as a polis , but in C5s the Kimolians were members of the Delian League ( infra ); in a C4s arbitration they were on equal terms with the polis of Melos ( infra ), and a C3s text from Karystos does explicitly refer to ταtildeς πόλευς ταtildeς Κι µ ωλίων ( SEG 44 710 . 28 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins of C3 (Head, HN ² 484 ) and externally in inscriptions ( IG i² 289 . i . 18 ; IG xii . 3 1259 . 7 (C4s) = Tod 179 ; Ager ( 1996 ) no. 3 ; Magnetto ( 1997 ) no. 1 ). The individual and external use is attested in the Athenian naval catalogue of C5l ( IG i³ 1032 . 87 ). Kimolos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Island district, but is absent from the full panel of 441 / 0 ( IG i³ 271 . i -ii . 88 -101 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 89 ) ( 1 , 000 dr.), but is recorded only once in the tribute lists, viz . in 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 18 ), paying an unknown amount. Soon after 338 the Kimolians were involved in a dispute with the Melians (no. 505 ) over the possession of the three small islands of Polyaiga (which, later at least, had no permanent population but was used as pasturage (L. Robert ( 1949 ) 167 )), Etereia and Libeia. In accordance with a decision of the synedrion of the League of Corinth, the dispute was submitted to arbitration by Argos (no. 347 ), and the Argives decided in favour of Kimolos ( IG xii . 3 1259 = Tod 179 ; Ager ( 1996 ) no. 3 ; Magnetto ( 1997 ) 1 -8 no. 1 ). A certain amount of the ancient polis centre (which, unlike most Aegean Islands, does not lie under modern Chora) has been lost due to sea level changes (Mustakas ( 1954 -55 ) 153 -54 ). Lauffer ( 1989 ) 329 has references to walls, sanctuaries and other remains."
497,Kos (Koos),The Aegean,36.5,27.15,3047,14161,"497 . Kos (Koos) Map 61 . Lat. 36 . 50 , long. 27 . 15 . Size of territory: 4 ( 290 km ² ). Type:A (from 366 / 5 , infra ). The toponym is Κῶς , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 677 ; Hdt. 9 . 76 . 2 ; Thuc. 8 . 41 . 3 ; Herzog ( 1928 ) 14 -16 no. 5 .B. 8 (C4m); Head, HN ² 632 (C5 )) or Κόως ( Hymn. Hom. Ap . 42 ; Hes. fr. 43 a. 57 ). The toponym denotes sometimes the island (Thuc. 8 . 41 . 3 ), sometimes, probably, the city Κῶς ηasper Μεροπίς (Hdt. 1 . 144 . 3 ; Thuc. 8 . 41 . 2 ), and sometimes the C4synoecised polis (Dem. 15 . 27 ). The ethnic is ΚΩsubiotaῶος ( IG i³ 262 . iv . 15 ; Hdt. 7 . 99 . 2 ). It sometimes denotes the inhabitants of the island (Hdt. 9 . 76 . 2 -3 ; Pl. Prt . 311 B),and sometimes the citizens of the polis ( IG i³ 1454 .A. 29 ; Iscr. Cos ED 34 . 5 (C4 )). Kos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Ps.-Skylax 99 ; Dem. 35 . 35 , see Hansen ( 2000 ) 154 ; LSCG 151 . 55 (C4m); perhaps Paton and Hicks ( 1891 ) no. 5 . 7 -8 ) and in the political sense (Dem. 15 . 27 and inscriptions of after 366 / 5 : Iscr. Cos ED 19 . 4 -5 (C4 -C3 ), 20 . 1 , 3 , 11 (all C4l), 54 . 8 -9 (C4 ), 55 .A 11 , 17 , B 10 , 13 (C4 ), 241 . 26 (C4 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in inscriptions ( Iscr. Cos ED 19 . 5 , 54 . 4 , 55 .B. 3 ) and externally in literary sources (Hdt. 1 . 144 . 3 , 7 . 99 . 2 ) and in inscriptions ( IG i³ 262 . iv . 15 ; CID i 12 . 2 (C4f); F.Delphes iii . 1 497 . 11 (C4l/C3e); SEG 9 2 . 28 , Kyrene ( c. 330 -326 )). The external and individual use of the ethnic is attested in literary sources (Hdt. 7 . 163 . 2 , 9 . 76 . 2 ; Pl. Prt . 311 B) and in inscriptions ( IG i³ 1454 . 29 (C5s); IG ii² 9143 (C4f); Peek ( 1969 ) 25 no. 53 (C5 )). The Koans belonged to the Dorian pentapolis (Hdt. 1 . 144 . 3 with Sherwin-White ( 1978 ) 47 ) and to the Delian League, paying tribute ( infra ). Within this framework fit at least two poleis up until 366 / 5 , and it is not always easy to distinguish before this date the use of the ethnic as a city-ethnic from its use as a regional ethnic denoting an inhabitant of the island of Kos. In Homer Kos and the Kalydnian islands (no . 485 ) are explicitly decribed as 'the poleis of Eurypylos' (Hom. Il . 2 . 677 , see also 14 . 255 , 15 . 28 ). Hymn.Hom.Ap 42 describes Kos as πόλις Μερόπων ανθρώπων . According to Herodotos ( 7 . 99 . 3 ), Kos was settled by the Epidaurians (no. 348 ). After the collapse of Kroisos' Lydian kingdom and the imposition of Achaemenid suzerainty in western Asia Minor in 546 , Kos was controlled by the tyrant Skythes. C. 490 his son Kadmos voluntarily abdicated the tyranny (Hdt. 7 . 164 . 1 ), and control of Kos passed to the Karian dynasty under Artemisia, whose command at Salamis included Koan sailors (Hdt. 6 . 22 -24 , 7 . 99 . 2 , 163 -64 , ). Kos may have controlled the island of Nisyros (no. 508 ) c. 500 (Hdt. 7 . 99 with Hicks in Paton and Hicks ( 1891 ) p. xii). Kos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district ( IG i³ 269 . iv . 15 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 262 . iv . 15 ) to 427 / 6 or 426 / 5 ( IG i³ 284 . 18 ) a total of eleven times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 5 tal. ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 67 ); but in some years ( 450 / 49 , 447 / 6 ) the phoros is split up into smaller amounts ( IG i³ 263 . i . 7 and v . 40 ). The explanation may be that in these years two poleis on Kos paid separately, whereas in other years they paid together in a synteleia . Kos was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 132 ). Some time in the same period a temenos of Athena Medeousa, an indication of Athenian authority, was installed; but from this a klerouchia should not necessarily be inferred ( Iscr. Cos EV 361 , see also EV 333 ; Mattingly ( 1996 ) 65 ). A copy of the famous Athenian Coinage Decree was posted on Kos ( Iscr. Cos ED 1 = ML 45 ). Kos remained under the Athenians until 411 (Thuc. 8 . 108 . 2 ); over the next five years its position shifted, till apparently coming under Spartan sway for good in 407 (Diod. 13 . 69 . 5 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 5 . 1 ; cf. Hicks in Paton and Hicks ( 1891 ) pp.xxv-xxvi).The Koans fell away from the Spartans in 394 following the battle of Knidos (Diod. 14 . 84 . 3 ), but their name does not appear on the stele of Aristoteles among the members of the Second Athenian Naval League (for membership: Cargill ( 1981 ) 37 -38 ; contra Hornblower ( 1982 ) 133 ; non liquet Dreher ( 1995 ) 123 ). But in 357 , when Chios (no. 840 ), Rhodos (no. 1000 ) and Byzantion (no. 674 ) seceded from the Naval League, Kos joined the alliance concluded with Mausolos and took part in the Social War against Athens (Dem. 15 . 3 , 27 ; Diod. 16 . 7 . 3 ; cf. Staatsverträge 305 ). In C4m Kos was controlled by the Hekatomnids ( Suda ∆ 238 with Hornblower ( 1982 ) 132 -33 ). In 333 the island was conquered by Alexander (Arr. Anab . 2 . 5 . 7 ), won back by the Persians,but conquered definitively in 332 (Arr. Anab . 3 . 2 . 6 ). During the crisis of c. 330 -326 , Kos received 10 , 000 medimnoi of grain from Kyrene (no. 1028 ) ( SEG 9 2 . 28 ). A unified Koan state was created in 366 / 5 by the metoikismos of at least two pre-existing poleis , Astypalaia and Kos Meropis (see infra ). This action is attested by Diodorus ( 15 . 76 . 2 ) and Strabo ( 14 . 2 . 19 ). The event has been treated often: e.g. Hicks in Paton and Hicks ( 1891 ) p. xxvii; Moggi, Sin . 333 -41 no. 47 ; Sherwin-White ( 1978 ) 63 -67 ; Hornblower ( 1982 ) 83 -84 , 103 -4 n. 197 ; Demand ( 1990 ) 127 -32 ; Reger ( 2001 ) 171 -74 . Strabo attributes the decision to stasis . The incident referred to by Arist. Pol . 1304 b 25 is surely later (Sherwin-White ( 1978 ) 65 -66 , contra Gehrke, Stasis 98 ). It has been denied that a political unification of separate poleis in fact occurred, as has been virtually the universal scholarly opinion until recently (Stylianou ( 1998 ) 484 -85 ), but the details of the organisation of the two poleis leave little doubt that the standard view is right (see now Reger ( 2001 ) 171 -74 and infra ), except in so far as the Koans, like other islanders and certain other small states, paid their tribute to Athens as a group and were identified as a group of islands. The eponymous magistrate of the unified Koan polis was the monarchos (Herzog ( 1928 ) 20 -25 no. 8 .A 1 (C3f); cf. Gehrke, Stasis 97 n. 1 ; Sherk ( 1990 ) 265 -66 ). Decrees were passed by the boule and the ekklesia ( Iscr. Cos ED 54 . 1 (C4 )) or by the ekklesia ( Iscr. Cos ED 34 . 1 (C4 )) on the motion of a board of prostatai as moved by the head of the board ( Iscr. Cos ED 40 . 1 -4 ; Paton and Hicks ( 1891 ) no. 2 . 9 -10 ) or by an individual ( Iscr. Cos ED 34 . 2 , 54 . 1 -2 ). An epistates is also attested ( Iscr. Cos ED 106 . 2 -3 (C4 )); cf. Rhodes, DGS 237 . Koan officials included a board of poletai ( Iscr. Cos ED 20 . 16 (C4l), 54 . 13 -14 (C4 )). One text mentions έκκλητοι δικαστ [ αί ( Iscr. Cos ED 26 C5 (C4l?)), and a dikasterion is mentioned in Iscr. Cos ED 90 . 4 , 9 (C4e). Aristotle says that the Koan constitition was a democracy subverted by demagogues and then replaced by an oligarchy (Arist. Pol . 1304 b 25 -27 ). Kos became a democracy once again in, probably, 332 (Gehrke, Stasis 99 n. 18 ). A fragmentary early sacred law mentions τοgrave ιasperερόν ( Iscr. Cos ED 53 (C4 ; C5 -C4 according to Herzog ( 1899 ) 128 -30 no. 194 )); a later law of C4 protects the trees of the temenos of Apollo Kyparissios and Asklepios from being cut down for any reason, and forbade even the introduction of a motion to that effect (Herzog ( 1928 ) 32 no. 12 + Iscr. Cos ED 181 ). A series of sacred laws of C4m seems to regulate religious observances of the newly constructed Koan state (Herzog ( 1928 ) 5 -10 no. 1 , 12 -14 no. 4 = LSCG 151 , 19 -25 nos. 6 -8 , 32 -33 no. 12 = LSCG 150 + Iscr. Cos ED 55 , 140 , 181 , 241 ; perhaps also ED 53 of C4 ). The many public cults known from Kos thanks in large part to the rich harvest of sacred laws include those of ( 1 ) Apollo Kyparissios (cf. Hymn.Hom.Ap . 42 ) and ( 2 ) Asklepios (Herzog ( 1928 ) 32 -33 no. 12 + Iscr. Cos ED 181 ); ( 3 ) Hera (Makareus, FGH 4 . 442 (Ath. 262 C)); ( 4 ) Rhea,Hera Argeia Eleia Basileia, Zeus Machanes, the Twelve Gods, Zeus Polieus, Athena Machanis ( Iscr. Cos ED 241 ); ( 5 ) Homonoia, Hekate, Histia Tamia, Aphrodite Pandemos (Pugliese Carratelli ( 1963 -64 ) 158 no. I; Paton and Hicks ( 1891 ) 401 ; LSCG 295 -98 no. 169 (C3 )) with the important discussion of the circumstances of the origin of the cult of Homonoia in Thériault ( 1996 ) 134 -36 ); ( 6 ) Zeus Basileus ( Iscr. Cos EV 27 (C4 )); ( 7 ) Kore ( Iscr. Cos EV 235 (C4l)); ( 8 ) Demeter ( Iscr. Cos EV 270 (C4 )); ( 9 ) the Nymphs ( LSCG 152 -53 ); and ( 10 ) Herakles ( Iscr. Cos ED 140 . 8 -9 ; cf. also ED 149 ), whose worship should no doubt be associated with his adventure on Kos in which he was wounded (see Koenen and Merkelbach ( 1976 )). In C4 the Koans awarded proxenia to citizens of Tyros ( Iscr. Cos ED 54 ), Knidos (no. 903 ) ( Iscr. Cos ED 34 ), Byzantion (no. 674 ) ( Iscr. Cos ED 40 ), Mytilene (no. 798 ) ( Iscr. Cos ED 106 ) and Sinope (no. 729 ) ( Iscr. Cos ED 20 ). Koan citizens were awarded proxenia by Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IAEpid . 42 . 58 (C4l/C3e)) and the Plataseis ( Labraunda 48 = Mausolos M 8 ). The Koan state was organised into the three traditional Dorian tribes of Pamphyloi, Hylleis and Dymanes, further subdivided into three chiliastyes each, also called enatai ( LSCG 151 A. 5 , 16 (C4m); Herzog ( 1928 ) 6 no. 1 . 7 , 11 , 12 , 15 ; cf. Jones, POAG 236 -38 ). Each tribe had its own special location for sacrifice ( Iscr. Cos ED 140 . 2 -5 (C4 )). In addition there were an unknown number of triakades ( Iscr. Cos ED 55 .A 2 (C4m)) and pentekostyes ( Iscr. Cos ED 91 . 3 (C4 )) whose relationship to the tribes and their subdivisions remains uncertain (Jones, POAG 238 -39 ). Cutting across this system of personal groupings there was a subdivision into at least ten demes (cf. the list in Jones, POAG 239 ). One of these, Isthmos (demotic: οasper δηtilde µ ος οasper ' Ισθ µ ιατῶν , IG xi . 2 287 .B. 45 (C3m)), was located at the site of Astypalaia (see infra ). Another deme-which one is not known, unfortunatelyalso had at least one tribal subdivision ( Iscr. Cos ED 138 . 1 -2 ( c. 206 / 5 ); see Habicht ( 2000 ) 309 -10 , 327 (date)). Parts of Kos town have been the object of intensive excavation, particularly after a severe earthquake of the 1930 s opened up opportunities for the Italian archaeologists working there; no final excavation reports have ever been published, but there is a good summary of the state of work as of the 1940 s (Morricone ( 1950 )). Long runs of the fortification walls have been uncovered (des Courtils et al . ( 1982 ) 414 ; BCH 118 ( 1994 ) 798 ), perhaps the walls of 366 / 5 (Diod. 15 . 76 . 2 ). Sanctuaries include the great Asklepieion, begun in C4 but a site of worship originally of Apollo in C5 (Schatzmann ( 1932 ) 'Zeittafel'; for an altar of C4 bearing the names of some of Asklepios' children, see p. 26 ); a sanctuary for Artemis, Zeus Hikesios and the Theoi Patrioi ( SEG 14 529 (C2 )); temples for Demeter and Dionysos in the town centre ( Iscr. Cos ED 140 . 5 (C4 ); BCH 118 ( 1994 ) 795 ). Remains of the theatre ( TGR ii. 147 ) are Heltic (Sherwin-White ( 1978 ) 25 ); but references to the theatre in Eudoxos (fr. 363 , Lasserre) testify to a C4 antecedent.A sanctuary of the Twelve Gods is attested in a C4 inscription ( Iscr. Cos ED 54 . 15 ; see also their worship at the Charmyleion: Paton and Hicks ( 1891 ) no. 349 with Kader ( 1995 ) 201 -2 ). A sanctuary of Demeter,a ∆α µ άτριον , is attested ( Iscr. Cos ED 140 . 5 ). A sanctuary starting in C4m to the Eleusinian gods has been located at Kyparisi (Laurenzi ( 1931 ) 623 -25 ). A stoa by the harbour may date from C4 (Coulton ( 1976 ) 248 ). Next to nothing is known about Hippokrates of Kos (Pl. Phdr . 270 C; Prt . 311 B) and his medical school of Asklepiadai ( CID i 12 (C4f)). The various pseudepigraphica about Hippokrates and Kos are late innovations and cannot be used for reliable information about the institutions and history of the Koan polis in C6l-C5s (Jouanna ( 1999 ) 12 -16 , 21 -24 ; for the writings, see now Smith ( 1990 )). Kos struck coins of electrum and silver on the Aeginetan standard in C6 , coins of silver on the Persic standard in C5f, and coins of silver and bronze after 366 / 5 . ( 1 ) Silver and electrum,C6 . Types: obv . crab; rev . incuse square. ( 2 ) Silver, C5f. Types: obv . naked diskobolos with tripod behind; legend: ΚΟΣ or ΚΩΣ or ΚΩΙΟΝ ; rev . crab in incuse square. ( 3 ) Silver from 395 : obv . head of bearded or beardless Herakles often with lion's scalp, facing l. or r.; rev . crab and club in dotted incuse square, or draped female head facing l. (Demeter?); legend: ΚΩΙ or ΚΩΙΟΝ and magistrate's name.( 4 ) Bronze from c. 330 : obv . head of beardless Herakles with lion's scalp; rev . crab; legend: ΚΩΙ and magistrate's name (Head, HN ² 632 -34 ; Paton and Hicks ( 1891 ) pp. 305 -6 ; Barron ( 1968 ); Erxleben ( 1970 ) 87 -88 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) 245 -46 ; Ingvaldsen ( 2002 ); SNG Cop. Caria 615 -26 ). There has been some discussion about whether the legend ΚΩΙΟΝ on some coins should be taken as a Doric genitive plural (hence the ethnic) or as a ktetikon (so Sherwin-White ( 1978 ) 45 ); in light of the widespread variability in practice with respect to amphora stamps, even in poleis that used the Ionic alphabet (see Garlan ( 1999 ) 19 -20 ), final judgement must be suspended. (Koray Konuk (pers. comm.) reports that he has reinvestigated Koan coins and come up with important new results, but these have not been published.) The Koans are said to have participated in the colonisation of Elpia in Apulia (Strabo 14 . 2 . 10 ). In an inscription of C3m the Koans are called synoikistai of Kamarina (no. 28 ) ( SEG 12 379 = Rigsby ( 1996 ) no. 48 (C3m); Plut. Tim . 35 . 1 -2 (emended); see Talbert ( 1974 ) 204 ). There are two poleis well attested for Kos before the metoikismos of 366 / 5 : Astypalaia and Kos Meropis."
498,Astypalaia,The Aegean,36.45,27.0,396,2004,"498 . Astypalaia Map 61 . Lat. 36 . 45 , long. 27 . 00 . Size of territory: 3 ( c. 145 km ² or less). Type: C. The toponym is Αστυπάλαια , ηasper (Strabo 14 . 2 . 19 ; Steph. Byz. 140 . 8 ). There is no explicit attestation of the city-ethnic ( infra ). The name of this town is known certainly only from the description by Strabo ( 14 . 2 . 19 ) of the metoikismos of Kos in 366 / 5 ( supra ). For the possibility that the city was mentioned in Galen, see Walzer ( 1935 ) 336 app. with further references. Astypalaia became the deme of Isthmos in the unified Koan state (Sherwin-White ( 1978 ) 59 and especially Pugliese Carratelli ( 1963 -64 )). The toponym is ' Ισθ µ ός ( LSCG 154 A. 18 (C3f)). The demotic is ' Ισθ µ ιώτας ( Iscr. Cos ED 55 B. 9 (C4 )). Isthmos displayed its own internal organisation: in the Heltic period the deme was itself divided into three tribes, the Theadai, Kyniadai and Melainadai (Pugliese Carratelli ( 1963 -64 ) 161 -63 no. VI.a 4 -5 and a 25 with a 8 ; 165 -81 nos. IX-XVIII with Jones, POAG 239 -41 ). Although there is no explicit evidence, the peculiarity of this deme in having its own tribal organisation would seem to find its best explanation in Isthmos' earlier status, like that of Astypalaia, as a self-governing polis before the metoikismos , or in the possibility that it persisted to function as a polis , albeit a dependent polis , after the synoecism.Another possible piece of evidence is the fact that Isthmos dispatched a theoria on its own account to Delos in 250 ( IG xi . 2 287 .B. 45 ). A monarchos attested at Astypalaia should be taken as the eponymous magistrate (Reger ( 2001 ) 173 -74 with refs.; contra Pugliese Carratelli ( 1957 )). A sanctuary of C5sits on the acropolis at Kephalos, the urban site of Astypalaia (MacKenzie ( 1897 -98 ); Herzog ( 1901 ) 138 , ( 1903 ) 2 -4 ; Sherwin-White ( 1978 ) 27 n. 84 for more refs.). The cult of Asklepios was a local cult here before the metoikismos , which introduced it to the island as a whole."
499,Kos Meropis,The Aegean,36.5,27.15,489,2357,"499 . Kos Meropis Map 61 . Lat. 36 . 50 , long. 27 . 15 . Size of territory: 3 ( c. 145 km ² or less). Type: A. The toponym is Κῶς ηasper Μεροπίς (Thuc. 8 . 41 . 2 ; Paus. 6 . 14 . 12 ) or just Κῶς (Thuc. 8 . 108 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is ΚΩsubiotaῶος (Ebert ( 1972 ) 154 -57 no. 49 with Reger ( 2001 ) and supra ). Kos Meropis is called a polis in the urban sense by Thucydides at 8 . 41 . 2 . The eponymous office may have been a board of prostatai ( Iscr. Cos ED 272 with Pugliese Carratelli ( 1957 ) 335 n. 3 , a decree of C4f dated επιgrave προστ [ αταtildeν ]) who continued to play an important role in the Koan polity after 366 (see Iscr. Cos ED 57 . 2 -3 : επιgrave προσταταtildeν τῶν συgraveν ---καιgrave Μονάρχο εγ Κῶι . . . , but which may be a decree of a deme (Herzog ( 1928 ) 20 -25 8 .A. 1 -3 )). Two citizens of Kos Meropis were Olympic victors ( Olympionikai 340 ( 420 ) and 363 ( 400 )). The urban centre seems to have been located at modern Chora. The later site of the Asklepieion was occupied in C5 by a sanctuary of Apollo Kyparissios overseen by a board of επι µ εληταιgrave τουtilde τε µ ένεος (Herzog ( 1928 ) 32 -33 no. 11 . 8 -9 ). A sacred law forbade the cutting down of cypress trees in the temenos except for public need (Herzog ( 1928 ) 32 no. 11 ); this law was strengthened after the metoikismos and the establishment of Asklepios in the sanctuary (see supra ). The site had a temple of Demeter and a sacred spring (dating not clear). Kos Meropis was unfortified in 412 (Thuc. 8 . 41 . 2 ) but was fortified by Alkibiades in the following year (Thuc. 8 . 108 . 2 ). Remains of a fortification wall have been identified with that mentioned by Thucydides (Kantzia ( 1988 ) 182 ; Bean and Cook ( 1957 ) 121 , followed by Pugliese Carratelli ( 1963 -64 ) 148 ). It has been suggested from time to time that Kos may have hosted other poleis as well (Sherwin-White ( 1978 ) 63 ), and certainly every deme attested from after the metoikismos is a potential candidate for being seen as such a polis . The mention in Ps.-Hippoc. Ep . 27 of τεσσάρων . . . τειχέων εν τηsubiotaηtilde νήσΩsubiotaω has been cited as evidence of additional towns (Hicks in Paton and Hicks ( 1891 ) p. xix; cf. generally Sherwin-White ( 1978 ) 58 -63 but also Reger ( 1997 ) 454 -55 , 483 -84 n. 32 ). Of the possibilities, only Halasarna is noted here."
500,Halasarna (Halasarnitas),The Aegean,36.45,27.1,242,1162,"500 . Halasarna (Halasarnitas) Map 61 . Lat. 36 . 45 , long. 27 . 10 . Size of territory: 1 ? Type: B. The toponym is Αasperλασάρνα (Paton and Hicks ( 1891 ) no. 7 . 3 ; -η Hsch. Α 2772 ) or Αasperλισάρνα (Strabo 14 . 2 . 19 ). The ethnic is Αasperλασαρνίτας (Paton and Hicks ( 1891 ) 372 -74 (all late)). Halasarna is called a polisma in an inscription of C4l (Paton and Hicks ( 1891 ) no. 7 . 3 ; for the date, see Herzog ( 1942 ) 13 -18 6 B. 6 )), and a chorion in Strabo 14 . 2 . 19 ( 657 ). There was a temple of C6 -C4 apparently dedicated to Apollo Pythaios (Kantzia ( 1988 ) 176 ); Aleura et al . ( 1990 ), more evidence now in the form of sherds inscribed ΑΠΟΛ ( λωνι ), but some doubts about the identification are expressed by Kokkorou-Aleuras et al . ( 1995 -96 ) 318 ). The urban centre was occupied from C6 (Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1962 ) 171 -72 ; see also Kokkorou-Aleuras et al . ( 1995 -96 ) 324 for pottery dating c. 575 -550 ). Cults attested at the site include those of Apollo, Herakles, Leto, Artemis, Hekate Stratia, Aphrodite, Zeus Polieus, Athena Polias and the Dioskouroi (KokkorouAleuras et al . ( 1995 -96 ) 313 -15 , with refs.)."
501,Kythnos (Kythnios),The Aegean,37.55,24.25,1671,7738,"501 . Kythnos (Kythnios) Map 58 . Lat. 37 . 55 , long. 24 . 25 . Size of territory: 2 ( 100 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Κυacuteθνος , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 90 , 8 . 67 . 1 ; Strabo 10 . 5 . 3 ), denoting both the island and the town (Ps.-Skylax 58 ). The city-ethnic is Κυacuteθνιος (Hdt. 8 . 46 . 4 ; Dem. 13 . 34 ; Agora xvii 526 (C4 )) or, once, Κίθνιος ( SEG 9 . 2 . 25 ). Artemidoros and Strabo agree in placing Kythnos among the Kyklades (Strabo 10 . 5 . 3 ). Kythnos is called a polis in the urban sense (Ps.-Skylax 58 ), and in Hdt. 8 . 46 . 1 it is subsumed under the heading polis where polis occurs in the political sense (Hdt. 8 . 42 . 1 , 49 . 1 ). The external use of the city-ethnic is attested collectively in inscriptions ( IG i³ 264 . iv . 37 ; SEG 25 357 , Nemea (C4l)) and in literary sources (Hdt. 8 . 46 ; Dem. 13 . 34 ), and individually in Athenian sepulchral inscriptions ( IG ii² 9115 ; Agora xvii 526 (both C4 )) and in a C5l list of sailors ( IG i³ 1032 . vi . 88 -89 ). The Kythnians contributed two ships to the Greek fleet at Salamis (Hdt. 8 . 46 . 4 ) and participated in the communal dedications at Delphi and Olympia after Plataia (ML 27 . 10 ; Paus. 5 . 23 . 2 ). Kythnos was a member of the Delian League, and may have been among the original members ( ATL iii. 198 -99 ). It belonged to the Island district ( IG i³ 271 . i . 91 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 27 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 19 ) a total of eleven times, three times completely restored, paying a phoros of first 3 tal. ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 27 ), raised to 6 tal. in, probably, 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 288 . i . 5 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 72 ) ( 6 tal.) and in 410 / 9 ( IG i³ 100 . i . 2 ). Hypereides wrote a Κυθνιακοgraveς λόγος (fr. 138 , Sauppe) and Aristotle a Κυθνίων πολιτεία (Harp. Κ 90 ). In C4s the Kythnians had a board of five strategoi , of whom three were elected from among those who had served as strategoi before (Vat. Gr. 2306 .B. i . 134 -40 ). During the crisis of 330 -326 Kythnos received 10 , 000 medimnoi of grain from Kyrene (no. 1028 ) ( SEG 9 . 2 . 25 ). The urban centre was situated in the north-western part of the island and was walled, probably by C4s (Mazarakis Ainian ( 1993 ), ( 1996 ) 251 , 256 -70 , ( 1998 ) 368 -70 ; Gounaris ( 1998 )). A temple on the acropolis, which has produced material of the Archaic through the Heltic periods, has been attributed to Demeter, or, less probably, Artemis or Hera (Mazarakis Ainian ( 1998 ) 370 -71 ); for a temenos on Kythnos controlled by the Athenian sanctuary of Demeter at Eleusis, see IG i³ 386 . iii . 147 . Other temples of uncertain identity have been discovered; one of these may be a sanctuary of Aphrodite, whose cult, long known from the Heltic period ( IG v 123 . 100 -20 with Themelis ( 1998 )), can now be attested from a C4 dedication ( SEG 47 1300 ; Mazarakis Ainian ( 1998 ) 372 -73 ). A C4sanctuary to the Samothrakian gods is attested epigraphically ( IG xii . 5 1057 (C4l/C3e); see Hemberg ( 1950 ) 220 ; Mazarakis Ainian ( 1998 ) 372 ) and archaeologically (Mazarakis Ainian ( 1996 ) 252 ). The doubts of Cole ( 1984 ) 68 can now be dismissed.There is now evidence for a settlement starting in the Geometric period at the island of Vryokastraki (Mazarakis Ainian ( 1998 ) 374 ). The island is said to have taken its name from one Kythnos (Steph. Byz. 392 . 2 ); later it was settled by Athenians under Kestor and Kephalenos (Dio Chrys. 80 . 26 . 9 ) The Kythnians now seem to have coined in silver in C6l or C5e. Denominations: one-third stater down to hemiobol. Types: obv . head of a wild boar, or Gorgoneion, or lily, or seated dog; rev . incuse square or plain flat surfaces (Kyrou and Artemis ( 1998 )). L emnos (L emnios ) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 55 , long. 29 . 15 . Size of territory: 4 ( 478 km ² ). The toponym is Ληtilde µ νος , ηasper (Hom. Od . 8 . 283 ; Hdt. 6 . 139 . 4 ; IG i³ 1466 ). The ethnic is Λή µ νιος (Thuc. 3 . 5 . 1 ; IG i³ 261 . i . 3 ). Lemnos is called a polis in the political sense in the King's Peace (Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 31 ). Lemnos is described as δίπολις in Eth . Magn . 279 . 6 ; cf. schol. Ap. Rhod. 1 . 601 . The collective use of the ethnic is attested internally on coins: ΛΗΜΝΙ (Head, HN ² 262 (C4m)) and externally in a list of mercenaries ( IG ii² 1956 . 91 ( c. 300 )). For the individual and external use of the ethnic,see Αντίδωρος Λή µ νιος (Hdt. 8 . 11 . 3 ); Antilochos, the philosopher opponent of Sokrates (Diog. Laert. 2 . 46 ); Apollodoros, a writer on farming (Arist. Pol. 1259 a 1 ); and Λη µ νίαν (Isae. 6 . 13 ) and Theoris (Dem. 25 . 79 -80 (C4 ); see Collins ( 2001 )). Ancient sources mention many non-Greek peoples as inhabiting Lemnos before the arrival of the Greeks (see IG xii . 8 , pp. 2 -3 ). C. 511 the Persians conquered Lemnos, exposed the island to an andrapodismos , and appointed a hyparchos (Hdt. 5 . 27 . 1 -2 ). The Lemnians are said to have had military forces and penteconters (Hdt. 6 . 138 . 1 ). In 499 Lemnos was seized by the Athenians (Hdt. 6 . 137 -40 ; IG i³ 552 bis and 1466 with Rausch ( 1999 ); the restoration of IG i³ 518 is uncertain; see also Salomon ( 1997 ) 31 -37 ), and thereafter the Lemnians were organised into the Kleisthenic tribes and demes ( IG i³ 522 bis , 1164 -65 (C5s); IG xii suppl. 337 (C5e); cf. Jones, POAG 187 -88 ). Colonists, however, though losing citizen rights in their metropolis,often copied its civic subdivision, and it seems likely that in C5 the Lemnians, though organised like the Athenians, were not Athenian citizens (Salomon ( 1997 ) 31 -66 ), but in C5m they were probably supplemented with klerouchs (Graham ( 1983 ) 175 -84 , ( 2001 ) 325-26 ). For a brief period between 404 and 394 / 3 , Lemnos was free of Athenian control; see Aeschin. 2 . 76 ; Andoc. 3 . 12 . In C4 , on the other hand, the Lemnians were indisputably Athenian klerouchs ( Agora xix L 3 passim ; Cargill ( 1995 ) 59-60 ) and Athenian citizens (Dem. 4 . 34 ). It is a moot point whether it is possible to distinguish between Athenian klerouchs and Athenians permanently settled on the island, as argued by Salomon ( 1997 ) 91 -155 . In 480 a Lemnian ship defected from the Persian fleet (Hdt. 8 . 11 . 3 ). The Lemnians are recorded once in the ATL ( IG i³ 261 . i . 3 ( 452 / 1 )). Thereafter all payments of phoros were made by the Hephaistieis and the Myrinaioi separately ( infra ). By the Peace of 404 Athens had to surrender Lemnos (Andoc. 3 . 12 ; Aeschin. 2 . 76 -77 ), but by 392 , after a short period of independence (Andoc. 3 . 12 , 14 , which Salomon ( 1997 ) 63 -66 sees,however,as in reality a Spartan hegemony,rejecting the standard interpretation of IG xii . 8 2 of Myrina), the Athenians had regained control of the island (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 15 ), and Athenian possession was confirmed by the King's Peace of 386 (Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 31 ). The grain law of 374 / 3 shows that Lemnos was an Athenian possession ( Hesperia suppl. 29 5 . 6 -8 ), in spite of the decision of 378 / 7 to renounce the klerouchies (Diod. 15 . 29 . 8 ). Lemnos was still Athenian in the 320 s (Arist. Ath . Pol . 62 . 2 ; IG ii² 3207 . 28 ; cf. Cargill ( 1995 ) 63 -64 ) and remained Athenian by the Peace of 322 (Diod. 18 . 18 . 4 ; see Cargill ( 1995 ) 42 -58 ). In C4 the Athenians seem to have had an archon on Lemnos ( Agora xix L 3 . 5 ( 387 / 6 )), and from the 350 s onwards they appointed a salaried hipparchos eis Lemnon (Arist. Ath . Pol . 61 . 6 , 62 . 2 ; Dem. 4 . 26 ; Bugh ( 1988 ) 209 -18 ). In C4m the Lemnians struck bronze coins. Types: obv . bearded head of Zeus(?); rev . ram walking in incuse square; legend: ΛΗΜΝΙ (Head, HN ² 262 ; Steinhardt ( 2000 ))."
502,Myrina (Myrinaios),The Aegean,39.5,25.05,748,3529,"502 . Myrina (Myrinaios) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 50 , long. 25 . 05 . Size of territory: probably 3 . Type: A. The toponym is Μυacuteρινα , ηasper (Hecat. fr. 138 c; Hyp. 2 . 18 ; IG ii² 550 . 16 ; SEG 19 59 ( 307 / 6 ); IG xii . 8 4 . 7 , 12 (C4m)). The city-ethnic is Μυριναῖος ( IG xii . 82 . 8 ). Myrina is called a polis in the political sense by Hypereides at 2 . 18 , and in the urban and political senses combined by Dionysios of Chalkis ( FGH iv 393 fr. 2 (C4 ?)). The collective use of the ethnic is attested internally in a proxeny decree of c. 400 ( IG xii . 8 2 ) and externally in the ATL ( IG i³ 267 . iv . 30 ). The only attestation of the individual use is in a sepulchral inscription of C2 : Μυριναία ( IG ii² 9975 ). As an Athenian dependency Myrina is called οasper δηtilde [ µ ος οasper ] Αθ [ ηνα ] ίων οasper ε [ ν Μυρ ] ίνει οικῶν ( IG xii . 8 4 . 1 -2 (C4m); cf. Cargill ( 1995 ) 13 ). In IG xii . 8 2 οasper δηtilde µ ος οasper Μυριναῖων (ll. 2 -3 , usually dated 404 -394 / 3 ; see also IG xii . 8 7 . 19 (C4l)) granting a citizen of Akrothooi (no. 560 ) proxenia with ateleia ; the standard view, that this represents a briefly independent Myrina, has been rejected by Salomon ( 1997 ) 63 -66 . In the Athenian tribute lists Myrina is listed as Μυριναῖοι ( IG i³ 267 . iv . 30 , etc.). All attestations of civic subdivisions copy Athens: citizens were organised into the Kleisthenic phylai and demoi ( IG xii . 8 5 (C4m); IG i³ 1164 (C5m)). Both when the Myrinaians were part of the Athenian state ( IG xii . 8 3 -5 (C4m)) and when they were independent ( IG xii . 8 2 ( c. 400 ) and 7 ( c. 318 -307 )), decrees were proposed and carried by the boule and the demos presided over by an epistates ( IG xii . 8 5 . 5 ). The Athenian siege of Myrina c. 500 implies city walls (Hdt. 6 . 140 . 2 ). We hear of walls again in 307 / 6 ( IG ii² 550 ; cf. Maier ( 1959 -61 ) no. 54 ). The urban centre which covered an area of c. 25 ha lay on a peninsula outside modern Kastro. There are remains of an older acropolis wall in polygonal masonry;and the settlement was cut off from the island by a younger wall across the neck of the peninsula (Fredrich ( 1906 a ) 243 -47 ; Sealey ( 1918 -19 ) 159 -60 ; cf. Lang ( 1996 ) 249 ). There were two sanctuaries of Artemis: one on the acropolis attested by remains (Fredrich ( 1906 a ) 246 ; see also Sealy ( 1918 -19 ) 160 -61 ) and boundary horoi (Segre ( 1932 -33 ) 297 -98 no. 5 ).An extra-mural sanctuary to Athena,probably as Selene, is attested by archaeological evidence from the Archaic period (Fredrich ( 1906 a ) 244 , 246 , identifying the archaeological remains as a temple associated with the Great Goddess; Archontidou-Arghyri ( 1994 ) 53 ; BCH 122 ( 1998 ) 912 -13 ) and by horoi (Segre ( 1932 -33 ) 294 -97 no. 4 with Jeffery ( 1990 ) 299 ; SEG 45 1192 , 40 745 ); archaeological evidence places its start in the Archaic period (ArchontidouArghyri ( 1994 ); BCH 122 ( 1998 ) 912 -13 ). Many decrees have been discovered at this sanctuary, which may well have been the Myrinaians' state archive and the goddess the protective deity (so Parker ( 1993 ); on Athena Lemnia, see further Steinhart ( 2000 )). Generally, see Archontidou-Arghyri ( 1994 ). A community of Chalkideans living in Myrina passed a decree honouring the Athenian epimeletes ( IG xii . 8 4 (after 348 : see SEG 45 1182 )). Myrina struck bronze coins from C4f onwards. Types: obv . head of Athena; rev . owl; legend: ΜΥΡΙ (Head, HN ² 263 ; for the date, see Kroll and Walker ( 1993 ) 179 )."

Hephaistia is called a polis in the political sense by Hypereides at 2 . 18 , and in the urban and political senses combined by Dionysios of Chalkis ( FGH iv 393 fr. 2 (C4 ?)). The collective use of the ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and externally in the ATL ( IG i³ 267 . iv . 31 ). Individuals are described as εξ ' Ηφαιστίας ( IG ii² 8826 (C4f)). As an Athenian dependency Hephaistia is called τοgraveν [ δηtilde µ ον τῶν Αθηναίων τῶν εν ' Ηφαιστίαι ] ( IG xii . 8 15 . 3 -4 (C4s); cf. 26 b),or just οasper δηtilde µ ος οasper εν ' ΗφαιστίΩsubiotaα (Hyp. 2 . 18 ). In the ATL Hephaistia is listed as ' Εφαιστι ˜ ες ( IG i³ 267 . iv . 31 , etc.). All attestations of civic subdivisions copy Athens: citizens were organised into the Kleisthenic phylai and demoi ( IG i³ 1477 (C5e); SEG 45 1181 (C4l/C3e); SEG 45 1189 (C4 )). A number of decrees concerning the Kabeireion were passed by the demos of the initiated ( οasper δηtilde µ ος τῶν τετελεσ µ ένων ). The organisation of the ekklesia is an exact copy of the Athenian ekklesia ( SEG 45 1181 , 1187 , 1189 ; cf. Cargill ( 1995 ) 181 -82 ). The eponymous official was an archon ( SEG 45 1181 ( c. 300 )). The name of the polis derives from Hephaistos, who is said to have landed on Lemnos after Zeus threw him out of Olympos (Hom. Il . 1 . 593 ); in a late inscription Hephaistia is called 'the polis of Hephaistos' ( IG xii . 8 27 . 1 -2 ). The Kabeireion, the sanctuary of the Dioskouroi, started in C8 and was in continuous use thereafter (Akousilaos ( FGrHist 2 ) fr. 20 ; Pherekydes ( FGrHist 3 ) fr. 48 , etc.; see Accame ( 1941 -43 ) for the inscriptions; Hemberg ( 1950 ) 160 -70 ; Beschi ( 1994 ), non vidi ; cf. SEG 45 1194 ). T emples of Herakles and of course of Hephaistos are known (Fredrich ( 1906 a ) 251 , 255 ; Sealey ( 1918 -19 ) 168 -69 ); the theatre is early Heltic ( TGR ii. 244 ). A possible fort or settlement within the territory of the polis has been reported at Kaminia (Fredrich ( 1906 a ) 252 -53 ). The famous Lemnian earth was mined here, though our earliest sources are late (Hasluck ( 1909 -10 )). In the territory of Hephaistia a number of horos inscriptions have been found, all modelled on the Athenian horoi (Finley ( 1985 ) nos. 103 -10 ; SEG 45 1185 -91 ). Recent Italian excavations have revealed town walls probably of C4 or later (see E. Carando, ASAtene forthcoming; AR ( 2000 -2001 ) 111 ; A. Di Vita, ASAtene ( 1998 / 2000 ) 386 , for the opinion that the walls are Archaic, perhaps as old as C7 ). They enclosed an area of 31 . 6 ha (Lang ( 1996 ) 56 ). Hephaistia struck bronze coins from C4f onwards.Types: obv . head of Athena in Corinthian helmet; rev . owl facing; legend: ΗΦΑΙΣΤΙ (Head, HN ² 262 ; for the date, see Kroll and Walker ( 1993 ) 179 )."
504,Leros (Lerios),The Aegean,37.05,26.5,613,2990,"504 . Leros (Lerios) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 05 , long. 26 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 ( 53 km ² ). Type: C. The toponym is Λέρος , ηasper (Thuc. 8 . 26 . 1 ; Hdt. 5 . 125 ). The city-ethnic is Λέριος (Demodokos fr. 2 . 1 -2 , West; in Strabo 10 . 5 . 12 erroneously ascribed to Phokylides). The fragment runs: καιgrave τόδε ∆η µ οδόκου . Λέριοι κακοί . ουχ οaspergrave µ έν , οaspergraveς δ ' ου . / Πάντες , πληgraveν Προκλέους -καιgrave Προκλέης Λέριος ( Anth . Pal . 11 . 235 ). If Prokles was the tyrant of Leros, as suggested by Manganaro ( 1963 -64 ) 297 , Leros was probably a tyrannically governed polis in C6 , and Λέριος is a city-ethnic attested externally both collectively and individually. But, even so, it is far from clear whether Prokles was a creature of the Milesians (no. 854 ) or was overthrown by them, as has been suggested on the basis of Demodokos' verses (see Manganaro ( 1963 -64 ) 297 ). A Milesian settlement on Leros, mentioned by Anaximenes in a list of Milesian colonies, cannot be closely dated and need not mean, as some have suggested, a Milesian klerouchia on Leros ( FGrHist 72 fr. 26 , from Strabo 14 . 1 . 6 ; Manganaro ( 1963 -64 ) 297 ; N. Ehrhardt ( 1983 ) 16 ). Hekataios urged Aristagoras during the Ionian Revolt to fortify Leros as a refuge, lest he be expelled from Miletos (Hdt. 5 . 125 ); Leros may therefore have been a Milesian possession by c. 495 , or the circumstances of the Revolt may have impelled the Milesians to take full control of the island. In any case the island was clearly Milesian by 454 / 3 , when the Athenian tribute lists record payment by Μιλέσιοι [ ε ] χς Λέρο ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 19 -20 ; see infra 1085 ), who are probably to be regarded as citizens who stayed loyal to Athens after the Milesians revolted (Meiggs ( 1972 ) 112 ). The main settlement shows occupation from C6 . There is, however, some dispute about its location (Bean and Cook ( 1957 ) 135 ; Benson ( 1963 ) 2 -12 , ( 1976 ) 501 ; Bürchner ( 1925 ) 2095 -96 ). At the north end of the island stood an extramural sanctuary dedicated to Parthenos and attested by C4l (Klytos of Miletos ( FGrHist 490 ) fr. 1 ; Manganaro ( 1963 -64 ) 306 -8 no. 3 . 22 -23 : [ εν τῶι ιasperερ ] ῶι τηtildeς Παρθένου εν [ Λέρωι ] (C3 -C2 ); see 308 -9 no. 4 . 9 , where the expression appears in full; Benson ( 1963 ) 16 -19 ); she was probably the protective deity. She is also mentioned as Παρθένος Λερία in a dedication found on Thera ( IG xii . 3 440 ). She has been identified as a type of Artemis (Manganaro ( 1963 -64 ) 301 ; cf. Nikandros in Anth. lib . 2 , non vidi ), but others see her as an indigenous goddess (Laumonier ( 1958 ) 550 ; see also N.Ehrhardt ( 1983 ) 149 ). Benson ( 1963 ) 12 -13 believed he had identified remains of an Asklepieion. The fort or fortified settlement at Xerokambos starts only in C4 (Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1970 ) 54 ). See Gorman ( 2001 ) 49 -51 for an overview. For the other so-called Milesian islands, see the Introduction."
505,Melos (Melios),The Aegean,36.45,24.25,1807,8631,"505 . Melos (Melios) Map 58 . Lat. 36 . 45 , long. 24 . 25 . Size of territory: 3 ( 151 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Μαtildeλος ( SEG 20 716 . 29 ( c. 330 ); I.Cret . ii xxiii 2 . 4 (C3 )) or Μηtildeλος , ηasper (Thuc. 3 . 91 . 1 ; Isoc. 19 . 21 ; IG i³ 370 . 72 , restored) denoting both the island and the town (Steph. Byz. 450 . 9 -10 ). An alternative toponym is Ζεφυρία (Steph. Byz. 450 . 11 ; Plin. HN 4 . 70 = Arist. fr. 564 ). The city-ethnic is Μάλιος ( IvO 272 = CEG i 419 (C6l); IG xii . 3 1259 . 6 Tod i79 ; Ager ( 1996 ) no. 3 ; Magnetto ( 1997 ) no. 1 (C4s)) or Μήλιος (Thuc. 3 . 91 . 2 ; IG i³ 71 . i . 65 ; I.Délos 104 . 73 ( 364 / 3 )) or Μηλιάς ( IG ii² 9356 (C4m)). Melos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Andoc. 4 . 23 ) and in the political sense (Thuc. 5 . 87 , 91 . 2 , 112 . 2 ). Isokrates describes Melos as a polichnion ( 12 . 98 ), perhaps as part of his effort to minimise the atrocities committed in C5 by the Athenians. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on some coins of C5 ( infra ) and on an inscription of C2 ( IG xii . 3 1097 ) and externally in inscriptions (ML 27 . 7 ( 479 ); IG xii . 3 1259 (C4s) = Tod 179 . 6 ; Ager ( 1996 ) no. 3 ; Magnetto ( 1997 ) 1 -8 no. 1 ) and in literary sources (Thuc. 5 . 84 . 3 ; Dem. 58 . 56 ). For the individual and external use, see IvO 272 (C6l); IG ii² 9356 (C4m); IG xii . 5 801 (C3f)). The most famous Melians were the poet Melanippides, victorious in Athens in 494 / 3 ( IG xii . 5 444 . 61 -62 = FGrHist 239 fr. 47 ), and Diagoras the Melian, condemned in Athens as atheos in 416 / 15 ; a price of 1 tal. was offered for his death (Ar. Av . 1073 -74 ; Lys. 6 . 17 ; Diod. 13 . 6 . 7 ; see Woodbury ( 1965 ) and Janko ( 2001 ), ( 2002 )). Patris is found in Thuc. 5 . 111 . 5 . Strabo, quoting Artemidoros, places Melos among the Kyklades ( 10 . 5 . 3 ). The Melians were allegedly colonists from Lakedaimon (no. 345 ) (Hdt. 8 . 48 ; Thuc. 5 . 84 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 3 ; Diod. 12 . 65 . 2 ; cf. Malkin ( 1994 ) 74 -76 ; Cartledge ( 2002 ) 93 -94 ), and the Melians believed themselves that this colonisation took place 700 years before the Athenian attack in 416 / 15 (Thuc. 5 . 112 . 2 ; see Malkin ( 1994 ) 74 -77 ). A C1 historian reports that the Milesians (no. 854 ) attacked Melos, perhaps in C8e or C7 (Konon ( FGrHist 26 ) fr. 1 . 44 ); perhaps this event, if historical, should be associated with the Parian and Milesian struggles in the Archaic period (see 765 and 1084 infra ). The Melians refused Persian demands to submit in 490 , and supplied troops and two pentekonters to the war effort in 480 (Hdt. 8 . 46 . 4 , 48 ); they are recorded on the Serpent Column in Delphi (ML 27 . 7 ) and also appear in the dedication at Olympia (Paus. 5 . 23 . 2 ; cf. Hdt. 9 . 81 . 1 ). The Melians, however, did not join the Delian League (Thuc. 2 . 9 . 4 ). They are recorded as having contributed to the Spartan war fund ( ML 67 . 1 -7 , 13 -17 , with Loomis ( 1992 ), perhaps in the earlier phases of the Peloponnesian War, perhaps around 410 -405 (so Piérart ( 1995 )). At about the same time the Athenians ravaged the island (Thuc. 3 . 91 . 1 -3 ( 426 / 5 )) and soon thereafter added the Melians to the assessment for 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 65 ) ( 15 tal.). Thucydides' description of the famous Athenian siege of 416 / 15 shows Melian troops active, often quite successfully, on the island in opposition to the Athenian invaders ( 5 . 84 , 114 . 1 -2 , 115 . 4 , 116 . 2 -4 ), but the town was betrayed, and at defeat the Athenians killed the adult male citizens and subjected the rest of the population to andropodismos (Thuc. 5 . 116 . 4 ; cf. also Isoc. 12 . 63 ; Andoc. 4 . 22 ). Five hundred Athenian colonists were installed in 415 (Thuc. 5 . 116 . 4 ; see Figueira ( 1991 ) 220 ). A tombstone of C5l probably commemorates one of the Melian traitors who was afterwards rewarded with Athenian citizenship ( IG xii . 3 1187 ). It is to this period that most of our evidence about civic organisation dates (see Jones, POAG 214 -15 ). The Spartans took Melos in 405 from the Athenians and allowed the population to return (Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 9 ; Plut. Lys . 14 . 4 ). In C4mMelos was a pirates' nest, and Athens had the Melians fined 10 tal. for harbouring the pirates (Dem. 58 . 56 ). Soon after 338 the Melians were involved in a dispute with the Kimolians (no. 496 ) over the possession of the three small islands of Polyaiga, Eteireia and Libeia. In accordance with a decision of the synedrion of the League of Corinth, the dispute was submitted to arbitration by Argos (no. 347 ), and the Argives decided in favour of Kimolos ( IG xii . 3 1259 = Tod 179 ; Ager ( 1996 ) no. 3 ; Magnetto ( 1997 ) 1 -8 no. 1 ). C. 330 , in consequence of an offence committed by, among others, a Melian Olympic victor, the Melians, alongside a number of Peloponnesian poleis , paid damages to envoys sent from Kyrene (no. 1028 ) ( SEG 20 716 ; for the context, see SEG 39 1717 ; for the date, see SEG 46 2198 p. 636 ). The Aristotelian collection of politeiai seems to have included a Constitution of the Melians (fr. 564 ); but we know next to nothing about the Melian political institutions. In 416 / 15 Thucydides ( 5 . 84 . 4 -86 ) notes the absence of a decision-making popular assembly ( τοgrave πληtildeθος ), combined with the presence of Melian magistrates ( αρχαί ) and a council ( συacuteνεδροι ) described as 'the few'( οιasper ολίγοι ). The presumption is that Melos was oligarchically governed; but we cannot tell whether that was the normal situation or the result of the Athenian attack. The betrayal of Melos to the Athenians in 416 testifies to a stasis between a pro-Athenian and an antiAthenian faction (Thuc. 5 . 116 . 3 ). A Melian proxenos has been restored in a C4m inscription from Karthaia ( IG xii . 5 542 . 30 , but dubiously). The urban centre of Melos must have been fortified in 424 , when the Athenians under Nikias attacked the island (Thuc. 3 . 91 . 1 -3 , 94 . 1 ; Diod. 12 . 65 . 3 ), but the walls mentioned in Thucydides' account were built by the Athenians as part of their operations; the isodomic sections may represent repair and enhancement of a pre-existing (C6l-C5e?) wall in Lesbian/polygonal masonry (Thuc. 5 . 114 . 1 , 115 . 4 , 116 . 2 ; Cherry and Sparkes ( 1982 ), with further refs.; Wagstaff and Cherry ( 1982 b ) 261 ). The agora mentioned by Thucydides in the same context ( 5 . 115 . 4 ) may actually refer not to the Melians' , but to a military agora serving the Athenian besiegers. However, Melos did have an agora in the Classical period, which has been identified archaeologically (Kenzler ( 1999 ) 112 -13 , with further refs.).A C6 inscription may attest to a cult of Athena ( IG xii . 3 1075 with Pontani ( 1937 ); Jeffery ( 1990 ) 320 ). A cult of Asklepios has been inferred for C4 (Semeria ( 1986 ) 954 ). The Melian countryside appears to have supported a considerable number of settlements, some of which may have been large enough to be regarded as villages (Cherry ( 1982 ) 18 fig. 2 . 1 , 22 fig. 2 . 6 ; Wagstaff and Cherry ( 1982 a ) 142 -45 ). Growth of the urban centre to a maximum size of about 19 ha during the Classical period has been interpreted as nucleation,perhaps in response to the Athenian conquest of 416 / 15 (so Snodgrass ( 1987 -89 ) 60 ). In C6l ( c. 515 : Boutin ( 1986 ) 3 ) the Melians began to produce silver coins on the Milesian-Phoenician standard, although a stater on the Aiginetan standard has been attributed to the island (see Erxleben ( 1970 ) 72 ). ( 1 ) Silver, C6 . Denomination: stater. Types: obv . ewer; legend: ΜΑΛΙ ; rev . incuse square with diagonal bands. ( 2 ) Silver, C5 . Denominations: stater, hemiobol. Types: obv . pomegranate with leaves; legend: ΜΑΛΙ (sometimes retrograde); rev . incuse square with diagonal bands; legend: ΜΑ . Some staters have rev . triskeles or crescent; legend: ΜΑΛΙΟΝ . ( 3 ) Silver on the Rhodian standard, C4 . Denominations: didrachm, drachm. Types: obv . pomegranate (both denominations); rev . on didrachms: trident, or kantharos, or ram's head; legend: ΜΑ .

Aegean Islands 679 -89 ).A hoard of about 100 staters found on Melos in 1907 ( IGCH 27 ) has been argued to reflect anxieties about possible Athenian attacks c. 420 (Kraay ( 1964 )). The Melians colonised Kryassos in Karia, an event that cannot be closely dated (Plut. Mor . 246 D-E; Polyaen. 8 . 64 ; cf. Nigdelis ( 1990 ) 199 ; Malkin ( 1994 ) 76 )."
506,Mykonos (Mykonios),The Aegean,37.25,25.2,583,2642,"506 . Mykonos (Mykonios) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 25 ; long. 25 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 ( 86 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Μυacuteκονος , ηasper (Aesch. Pers . 885 ; Hdt. 6 . 118 . 1 ; Eph. fr. 63 ; I.Délos 104 . 26 ( 364 / 3 )). The city-ethnic is Μυκόνιος (Archil. fr. 124 a; IG xii . 3 251 . 9 ). Mykonos is attested as a polis in the urban sense in an inscription of C4 -C3 ( Syll . ³ 1215 . 19 ) and appears under the heading polis used in the political sense in the so-called Charter of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 . 32 , 70 , 78 , B 19 ) and in the accounts of the Delian amphiktyones ( I.Délos 98 .A 11 , B 3 = IG ii² 1635 ( 377 -373 )). Ps.-Skylax ( 58 ) calls Mykonos dipolis . We do not know anything more about these two poleis except that they merged completely in C3s; it is likely that they were always involved in a federation or that one was dependent on the other ( Syll . ³ 1024 . 3 ( c. 200 ): οasperacuteτε συνοικίσθησαν αιasper πόλεις ; cf. Reger ( 2001 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins of C4 ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 264 . iv . 8 ) and in Archilochos fr. 124 a. For the individual and external use, see the C4 dedication by a Mykonian woman at Delos ( I.Délos 52 ). Strabo, citing Artemidoros, classes Mykonos with the Kyklades ( 10 . 5 . 3 ). There seem to be the remains of a sanctu- ary at Leno, located south-east of the modern town. The locations of the two polis centres remain uncertain, although one is likely to have been at Palaiokastro and the other at the site of the modern town (see Reger ( 2001 ) 163 -67 ). Mykonos was subdued by Persia during the reign of Dareios (Aesch. Pers . 885 ; Hdt. 6 . 118 . 1 ). After Xerxes' invasion of Greece, Mykonos became a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Island district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . ii . 7 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 28 ) a total of thirteen times, three times completely restored, paying a phoros of 1½ tal. in 452 / 1 , reduced to 1 tal. ( IG i³ 271 . i . 90 ) in 443 / 2 ( IG i³ 269 . v . 23 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 75 ) ( 2 tal., restored). Mykonos also belonged in the 370 s to the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 .B. 19 ). In C4 a citizen of Mykonos received proxenia from Anaphe (no. 474 ) ( IG xii . 3 251 . 8 -11 ). Bronze coins with the legend ΜΥ or ΜΥΚΟ and obverses often bearing the head of Dionysos are dated starting C4 by Head, HN ² 487 ; see also Svoronos ( 1893 )), but this may be too early (Reger ( 2001 ) 178 -79 )."
507,Naxos (Naxios),The Aegean,37.05,25.25,3750,17398,"507 . Naxos (Naxios) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 05 , long. 25 . 25 . Size of territory: 4 ( 430 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Νάξος , ηasper (Aesch. Pers . 885 ; Hdt. 5 . 28 ; Ant. 1 . 16 ; SEG 19 204 .A 3 ( c. 375 )), denoting both the island (Hdt. 5 . 31 . 2 ) and the town (Thuc. 1 . 137 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is Νάξιος ( I.Délos 1 . 3 ( c. 600 ); IG vii 3225 . 1 ( c. 500 ); IG i³ 1357 . 3 = CEG i . 58 ( 510 -500 ); Hdt. 8 . 46 . 3 ). Naxos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 6 . 96 ; Arist. fr. 566 , Gigon (rC6 )) and in the political sense (Hdt. 5 . 30 . 1 ; Thuc. 1 . 98 . 4 ; SEG 12 . 390 . 6 -7 , 32 , 44 ( c. 320 ); cf. SEG 30 1070 ). The territorial sense is attested at Hdt. 5 . 30 . 3 -4 . In the Delphic naopoioi accounts the Naxians appear as contributors in a list headed by the formula: τάδε πόλεις καιgrave ιδιῶται επάρξαντο ( CID ii 4 . i . 14 -16 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins of C4 ( infra ) and externally in inscriptions (ML 27 . 8 ( 479 ); I.Délos 98 B. 9 ( 377 / 6 ); CID ii 4 . i . 16 , 20 , 21 (C4f)) and in literary sources (Archil. fr. 89 . 6 , West; Hdt. 8 . 4 . 3 ; Thuc. 1 . 98 . 4 ; Arist. Pol . 1305 b 1 ). The individual use is attested internally on a tombstone of C4 -C3 ( IG xii . 5 67 , but perhaps a pierre errante ) and externally in inscriptions from Delos of C7 ( I.Délos 2 ), Athens of C6l ( IG i³ 1357 = CEG i . 58 ), Delphi of C4f ( CID ii 4 . i . 20 , 21 , 24 , 26 ), and Olympia of C4s ( IvO 651 ) and in literary sources (Hdt. 1 . 61 . 4 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 15 . 2 ; Oec . 1346 b 7 : Λυacuteγδα µ ις Νάξιος ). Patris is found in Arist. fr. 558 , Rose. Naxos is the largest Kykladic island (Strabo 10 . 5 . 3 ). In the Archaic period some of the wealthy Naxians lived in the asty and some in komai , of which one was called Ληsubiotaηστάδαι (Arist. fr. 566 ). Steph. Byz. claims that on Naxos there was a polis named Νυacuteσα ( 479 . 9 ) and another named Τραγία ( 630 . 8 ), where a certain Tragios Apollo was worshipped; he cites Eupolis for the plural form Τραγέαι ( PCG fr. 487 ), but it is not wholly clear whether the plural form denotes the polis on Naxos (in which case we have testimony for it from C5s) or the homonymous island (less likely). Herbst ( 1935 ) 2083 associates this sanctuary with a horos inscribed οasperacuteρος χωρίου ιasperερουtilde Απόλλωνος ( IG xii . 5 43 (C4 -C3 ?)); cf. also the remarks of F. Hiller von Gaertringen apud IG xii . 5 50 ). Aninscription of C4 gives the toponyms εν ' Ελαιουtildeντι and ε µ Μέλανι , persuasively identified with modern Melanes,so rich in sanctuaries ( IG xii suppl. 194 . 16 with Hiller von Gaertringen's comm. there, 14 -15 ). Πολίχνη was a district on the east coast ( IG xii . 5 test. 1415 ). The famous Naxian marble quarries had been opened by C7 and continued to operate throughout the Archaic and Classical periods (Kokkorou-Aleura ( 1992 ); Brun ( 1997 ) 407 -8 ). Naxos was said to have been occupied first by Thracians and then by Karians from Mt. Latmos under the leadership of Naxos, son of Polemon (Diod. 5 . 50 . 2 -7 , 51 . 1 -2 and 3 -4 ; schol. Dionys. Per. 525 , GGM ii 451 ; Steph. Byz. 468 . 7 -8 ). Later, Ionians from Athens colonised the island (Hdt. 8 . 46 . 3 ; Ael. VH 8 . 5 ; Paus. 7 . 3 . 3 ; Costa ( 1997 ) 51 ). The Naxians played a predominant role in the central Aegean during the Archaic period; their activities left remains both in the decoration of Delos and in a continuing hostility to Paros (no. 509 ). The Naxians and the Parians fought on and off in C7f (cf. Kontoleon ( 1952 ) E 2 col. i ll. 4 -32 ( SEG 15 517 ); Lanzillotta ( 1987 ) 71 -88 ; Berranger ( 1992 ) 205 -7 ; Costa ( 1997 ) 115 -28 ); at least once, the Parians imposed a severe defeat on the Naxians ( IG xii . 5 445 . 54 : the Parians). In C6s an oligarchy was followed by the tyranny of Lygdamis (Arist. Pol . 1305 a 39 - b 1 ) after a major stasis (Arist. fr. 566 ). Helped by 'the Naxian man Lygdamis'(Hdt. 1 . 61 . 4 ), Peisistratos in turn installed Lygdamis as tyrant on Naxos ( 540 -524 ) (Hdt. 1 . 61 . 3 -4 , 64 . 1 -2 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 15 . 2 -3 ; Arist. Oec . 1346 b 6 -12 ; see also Ath. 348 A-C; Costa ( 1996 ), ( 1997 ) 147 -68 ). Lygdamis' tyranny was replaced by an oligarchy of οιasper παχεῖς (Hdt. 5 . 30 . 1 )-established perhaps with assistance of the Spartans who overthrew him (Plut. Mor . 859 D)-until it in turn was overthrown c. 500 by the demos (E. W. Robinson ( 1997 ) 117 -18 ) after a new stasis (Gehrke, Stasis 123 -24 ); the oligarchs fled to Miletos (no. 854 ) and contributed to the outbreak of the Ionian Revolt against the Persians in 494 (Hdt. 5 . 30 ). The so-called list of thalassocracies in Eusebios ( Chronikon , p. 226 , Schoene; M. Miller ( 1971 ) 5 -6 , 40 -41 ) credits the Naxians with one in 515 -505 . Naxos was subdued by Persia during the reign of Dareios (Aesch. Pers . 885 ). In 499 the Naxians are said to have controlled Paros (no. 509 ), Andros (no. 475 ) and the other Kyklades around it (Hdt. 5 . 31 . 2 ; Paros doubted by Lanzillotta ( 1987 ) 105 -6 ). Led by Aristagoras and Megabates, the Persians attacked Naxos, but the Naxians learned about their plans beforehand and prepared for a siege by completing their walls and storing food and water,and the operation failed (Hdt. 5 . 34 ). Nine years later in 490 another Persian force successfully took the island when the Naxians abandoned their city and fled into the mountains; the Persians burned the city and temples and exposed the inhabitants they captured to an andrapodismos (Hdt. 6 . 96 ; see Costa ( 1997 ) 171 -80 ). The Naxian ships (four, five or six) under Persian authority at Salamis defected to the Greek side (Hdt. 8 . 46 . 3 ; cf. Aesch. Pers . 879 -887 ; for the numbers, Hdt. 8 . 46 . 3 , four; Hellanikos ( FGrHist iii B 323 a) fr. 28 , six; Ephor. fr. 187 , five, both cited at Plut. Mor . 869 A). The Naxians joined the Delian League in the summer of 477 as a πόλις συ µµ αχίς , contributing ships (Thuc. 1 . 98 . 4 , 99 ). Naxos belonged to the Island district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 35 , restored) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 27 ) a total of eleven times, three times completely restored, paying a phoros of 6 tal., 4 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 25 ), raised to 9 tal. in or before 417 / 16 ( IG i³ 288 . i . 4 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 63 ) ( 15 tal.). C. 475 -470 (Rhodes ( 1985 ) 12 -13 ) Naxos defected from the League but was reduced after a siege (Thuc. 1 . 98 . 4 , 137 . 2 ; Polyaen. Strat . 1 . 30 . 8 ). In 453 -448 , 500 Athenian klerouchs were settled on Naxos (Plut. Per . 11 . 5 -6 ; Diod. 11 . 88 . 3 ; Paus. 1 . 27 . 5 ; Pl. Euthphr . 4 C; Aeschin. 2 . 175 ; cf. Figueira ( 1991 ) 220 ). In C4e Naxos was allied with Sparta (no. 345 ), and in 376 an Athenian squadron under Chabrias laid siege to the city and defeated the Lakedaimonian auxiliary squadron in a major sea battle fought between Naxos and Paros (Diod. 15 . 34 . 3 -5 ; SEG 19 204 ). Thereafter the Naxians may have joined the Second Athenian Naval League in the 370 s ( I.Délos 98 .B 9 = IG ii² 1635 . 119 ; cf. Dreher ( 1995 ) 219 with 137 -38 ), but they are not recorded among the members listed in IG ii² 43 . They struck a treaty with Athens some time before 353 / 2 ( IG ii² 179 with Gauthier ( 1972 ) 168 , 331 ). In 345 / 4 the Naxians awarded the Athenian demos a crown ( IG ii² 1443 . 114 ). Naxian military prowess is relatively well attested. The war with the Milesians (C6 ?), recorded in two different traditions, by Plutarch ( Mor . 254 B-F, probably based on the Aristotelian Constitution of Naxos (fr. 567 . 1 )) and Parthenios, probably following Andriskos ( FGrHist 500 fr. 1 . 9 ), involved a siege in which the Naxians were locked up within the city walls and an expedition against the besiegers by Naxian forces. Polykrates the Samian tyrant borrowed troops from Lygdamis to secure his tyranny (Polyaen. Strat . 1 . 23 . 2 ). The Constitution of Naxos mentioned a strategia of Lygdamis (fr. 566 ), and the Naxians are said to have been able to muster 8 , 000 hoplites and 'many big ships' in 499 (Hdt. 5 . 30 . 4 ); a few years later they manned several triremes for the invasion of Greece (Hdt. 8 . 46 . 3 ; on the number, cf. supra ). The Aristotelian collection of constitutions included a Ναξίων πολιτεία (fr. 566 ). In C4l decrees were passed by the boule and/or the demos ( SEG 33 676 . 5 -6 , 10 ( c. 300 )). They were published by the grammateus of the boule , and set up in the sanctuary of Apollo at the expense of a board of tamiai (Matthaiou ( 1990 -91 ) 114 ). In C2 the eponymous official was the priest of Dionysos ( IG xii . 5 128 . 23 in add. p. 308 ), but an inscription from Arkesine on Amorgos of 325 -275 is dated by a board of aisymnontes ( IG xii . 7 67 B. 36 = Migeotte ( 1984 ) 168 -77 no. 49 )). A court in Naxos ([ δικασ ] τήριον ) is mentioned in the C4f treaty between Athens (no. 361 ) and Naxos ( IG ii² 179 . 9 ). Naxos granted proxenia to a citizen of Megaran (no. 225 ) ( SEG 33 676 ( c. 300 )), and five Naxians received proxenia and citizenship from Chios (no. 840 ) ( SEG 12 390 . 2 , 27 , 49 -54 ( c. 320 ); cf. SEG 30 1070 ). The protective deity was Dionysos (so the coins, see infra ; Diod. 3 . 66 . 1 , 4 . 61 . 5 , 5 . 52 ; Plut. Thes . 20 . 1 ; Plut. Mor . 741 A), who appears both without an epithet ( IG xii . 5 45 (C5 -C4 )) and as Dionysos Meilichios and Dionysos Bakcheus (Ath. 78 C, quoting the local historians Aglaosthenes ( FGrHist 499 ) fr 4 . and Andriskos ( FGrHist 500 ) fr. 3 (both C4s-C3f)). Ananios, however, speaks of Apollo who 'has' ( έχεις ) Naxos (Ananios fr. 1 . 2 , West; cf. Hymn.Hom.Ap . 44 ; IG xii . 5 42 (C6 -C5 ), 43 (C4 -C3 ); and see the Delion of C6 , supra ). We hear in C4 also of Athena Poliouchos ( IG xii . 5 41 ), Athena without an epithet ( IG xii . 5 40 (C6 -C5 )) and a sanctuary of the Kabeiroi ( SEG 25 939 ). Other communal cults include Zeus Melosios ( IG xii . 5 48 (C4 ); cf. Herbst ( 1935 ) 2082 -83 ), Zeus Euboulos ( IG xii suppl. 196 (C4 ), with Matthaiou ( 1992 -98 a ), Zeus Olympios ( IG xii . 5 49 (date not clear)), and Zeus Stratios ( IG xii . 5 50 (date not clear)); Demeter and Kore ( IG xii suppl. 196 (C4 ), with Matthaiou ( 1992 -98 a ); Demeter Hadreus (Lambrinoudakis ( 1979 ) 252 -54 ); Poseidon Helikonios ( SEG 36 761 (C5 -C4 ); cf. SEG 45 1138 ); the Nymphai Mychieis ( IG xii . 5 53 (C4 )); and Hestia (Plut. Mor . 254 B (C6 )). Only three Naxian months are attested: Ekatombaion, Kronion and Artemision ( IG xii . 7 67 B. 36 = Migeotte ( 1984 ) no. 49 ( 325 -275 ); IG xii . 5 45 (C4 ?); IG xii . 5 38 . 2 (C1 ); see Trümpy, Monat . 72 -73 and Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 119 ). The town of Naxos was walled by C6 (Andriskos ( FGrHist 500 ) fr. 1 . 1 ; Hdt. 5 . 34 ), in the 470 s (Thuc. 1 . 98 . 4 , 137 . 2 ; Ar. Vesp . 355 ) and in 376 (Diod. 15 . 34 . 4 ). (At Aen. Tact. 22 . 20 εν ΝάξΩsubiotaω is an unconvincing conjecture.) Remains of an undated city wall were seen by Dugit ( 1867 ) 35 -37 , but are no longer visible. To judge from preserved tombs and other remains, the walled town seems to have covered an area of 20 + ha. Traces of occupation from the Geometric period have been discovered toward the northern end of the present town ( ArchDelt 39 Chron . 292 -95 and 29 Chron . 867 -70 ). There was a Delion just outside the city walls in C6 (Andriskos ( FGrHist 500 ) fr. 1 . 1 ); for confirmation of the date, see BCH 96 ( 1972 ) 772 , re Geometric sherds from the site), which was probably at the site of the temple of Apollo Delios begun by Lygdamis c. 530 that still dominates the harbour (Welter ( 1924 ); Gruben and Koenigs ( 1968 ), ( 1970 ); briefly Gruben ( 1986 ) 344 -47 ; Koenigs ( 1972 )). A prytaneion and a theatre (restored) are attested in C3 ( IG xii . 5 35 with S. G. Miller ( 1978 ) 200 -1 nos . 368 -69 ), but a seat from the koilon of, probably, the theatre has been recovered, and Gruben ( 1982 a ) 165 -66 reports the discovery under the heading 'Archaische Bauten' . Pindar mentions a public cult of Hieros and Ephialtas (Pyth. 4 . 88 ; cf. IG xii . 5 56 ); a horos of Zeus Melosios of C4 ( IG xii . 5 48 ) and two of Apollo from C6e-C5s (Psarras ( 1999 )) and C4 -C3 ( IG xii . 5 42 ) indicate the existence of sanctuaries. Excavation has recovered a sanctuary dating from c. 570 at Yria (Lambrinoudakis and Gruben ( 1987 -88 ); Lambrinoudakis ( 1992 ); Gruben ( 1993 ) 99 -105 ); this has recently been assigned to Dionysos and identified as the chief sanctuary of the island (Gruben ( 1997 ) 300 ); the unfinished statue at Apollona, now seen as Dionysos, may have been intended to stand by this temple like the colossus of Apollo on Delos dedicated by the Naxians (ibid. 293 -300 ). There is an Archaic sanctuary for Demeter at Sangri (Kontoleon ( 1954 ); Lambrinoudakis et al . ( 1977 ) 382 -86 ; Gruben ( 1993 ) 106 -9 ), and another nearby at Gyroulos ( Ergon ( 1977 ) 156 -61 , ( 1979 ) 24 -25 ; Prakt ( 1977 ) 382 -86 ), which may be dedicated to Apollo ( SEG 31 744 ).A sanctuary of Athena was located in the vicinity of modern Sangri ( IG xii . 5 40 (C6 -C5 ) with test. 1421 ); Athena Poliouchos' sanctuary was situated northeast of the town at Engares ( IG xii . 5 41 with test. 1421 ). The sanctuary of Zeus Melosios was on the east side of Mt. Drios (the modern Ozia) (cf. Diod. 5 . 51 . 4 ), near Philoti ( IG xii . 5 48 with the map at IG xii . 5 fasc. 2 p. xxiii). The grotto of the Nymphai Mychieis lay north-east of the town ( IG xii . 5 53 ). Finally, the sanctuary of Otos and Ephialtas was at Melanes ( IG xii . 5 56 ). Many communal dedications of the Naxians are attested from several sanctuaries.The Naxian Leonidas,honoured in Olympia by the Arkadian polis of Psophis (no. 294 ) (Paus. 6 . 16 . 5 ; IvO 294 ), dedicated out of his own funds a Leonideion in 330 -320 (Paus. 5 . 15 . 2 ; IvO 651 ; Mallwitz ( 1972 ) 246 -54 ). On Delos, the Naxians dedicated a palm (Ath. 502 B with Bruneau ( 1990 ) 568 -71 ) and the famous colossus of Apollo dating to 590 -580 ( I.Délos 4 and 49 ; Bruneau and Ducat ( 1983 ) 125 -28 ; Bruneau ( 1988 ) 577 -82 ; Gruben ( 1997 ) 267 -87 ). Excavation and identification of the oikos of the Naxians known from C4 texts ( I.Délos 104 -25 . 5 , etc.) have shown that the building began in C7s (Courbin ( 1980 ); Bruneau and Ducat ( 1983 ) 119 -23 ; Gruben ( 1997 ) 301 -50 ). The Propylaia I and II of C5 have recently been claimed as Naxian work (Gruben ( 1997 ) 350 -72 ). The Naxians dedicated a stoa in C6l (Hellmann and Fraisse ( 1979 ) 85 -124 ; Bruneau and Ducat ( 1983 ) 146 -47 ). The famous lions,one of the original sixteen now gracing St. Mark's Square in Venice, were given in C7l (Gallet de Santerre ( 1959 ) 21 -36 ; Bruneau and Ducat ( 1983 ) 171 -74 ). A less spectacular dedication is the gold φιάλη καρυωτή , attested by an inscription of 365 / 3 and, as has recently been shown, by Athenaios ( I.Délos 104 . 34 -35 with Bruneau ( 1990 ) 568 -71 ; for the gold, see IG xi . 2 161 .B. 31 ). At Delphi, the Naxians dedicated the famous Sphinx, for which they had received promanteia ( Syll . ³ 292 with 17 a (from 332 ); Amandry ( 1953 ); a base reinscribed in C4suggests another dedication, but may be related to the Sphinx; see Jacquemin ( 1999 ) 69 , and contributed funds to rebuilding the sanctuary after the earthquake of 373 ( CID ii 4 . i . 16 -17 for the polis as a whole, 20 -27 for individual Naxians). The Naxians also participated in the communal dedications at Delphi and Olympia after Plataia (ML 27 . 8 ; Paus. 5 . 23 . 2 ; cf. Hdt. 9 . 81 ). The Naxians may well have controlled some of the smaller islands to the south-east, although there is no direct evidence. These would include the archipelago of the Phakous(s)ai (Steph. Byz. 655 . 3 -4 ; late inscriptions: IG xii . 7 507 -8 ), Herakleia ( IG xii . 7 509 with L. Robert ( 1949 )) and Nikasia ( Suda N 377 ; Plin. HN 4 . 68 ). The Naxians minted coins from c. 600 , first silver staters and trihemiobols on the Aiginetan standard. Types: obv . kantharos with or without a crown; rev . incuse square. The coins with kantharos and crown were apparently replaced c. 500 by coins with the plain kantharos, which had begun production a few years earlier. The Naxians continued to strike these types until their defection from the Delian League in c. 475 -470 (Nicolet-Pierre ( 1997 )). In C4 they struck silver drachms and obols on the Rhodian standard as well as bronze coins. Types: obv . Dionysos; rev . kantharos; legend: ΝΑΞΙΩΝ or ΝΑ (Head, HN ² 488 ; SNG Cop. Aegean Islands 702 -9 ). A Naxian tetradrachm appears in the Delian accounts starting in 364 / 3 ( I.Délos 104 . 66 -67 ). For possible attribution of some half-staters on the Milesian/Phoenician standard to Naxos instead of Anaphe (no. 474 ), see Erxleben ( 1970 ) 69 -70 , 73 . Naxian participation in the colonisation of Naxos (no. 41 ) on Sicily is suggested by Hellan. fr. 82 ; it has sometimes been doubted, but now seems confirmed by an inscription (Guarducci ( 1985 ); for a good summary, see Costa ( 1997 ) 87 -102 ). Naxian claims of colonisation on Amorgos (Steph. Byz. 86 . 14 ; schol. Dionys. Per. 525 ) may be Heltic inventions designed to justify the occupation of Aigiale (no. 471 ) and Minoa (no. 473 ) (Nigdelis ( 1990 ) 23 )."
508,Nisyros (Nisyrios),The Aegean,36.35,27.1,907,4032,"508 . Nisyros (Nisyrios) Map 61 . Lat. 36 . 35 , long. 27 . 10 . Size of territory: 2 ( 37 km ² , 49 km ² including the islets, see infra ). Type: A. The toponym is Νίσυρος , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 676 ; Theophr. De lap . 21 ; Diod. 5 . 54 . 3 ), denoting both the island (Ps.-Skylax 99 ) and the town (Strabo 10 . 5 . 17 ). The cityethnic is Νισυacuteριος (Hdt. 7 . 99 . 2 ; IG i³ 270 . i . 9 ) or Νισουacuteριος ( CID ii 4 . iii . 61 ( 360 / 59 ), 5 . i . 51 -60 ( 359 / 8 )). Nisyros is attested as a polis in the political sense at Hdt. 7 . 99 . 2 -3 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C4 coins ( infra ) and in C3 inscriptions ( IG xii . 3 88 . 6 ), and externally in inscriptions and literary sources (Hdt. 7 . 99 . 2 ). The individual and external use is attested in the accounts of the Delphic Naopoioi ( CID ii 4 . iii . 61 ( 360 / 59 ), 5 . i . 51 -60 ( 359 / 8 )). Ps.-Skylax 99 places Nisyros in Karia,but Steph.Byz. 477 . 7 among the Kyklades. The small islands off Nisyros (Strabo 10 . 5 . 16 ) were part of its territory. The island was supposed to have been created when Poseidon ripped off part of Kos and threw it into the sea (Paus. 1 . 2 . 4 ; Strabo 10 . 5 . 16 ; Apollod. Bibl . 1 . 6 . 2 . 4 ), a foundation myth reflected in the trident on the C4 coins ( infra ). Nisyros is said to have been colonised by Epidauros (no. 348 ) (Hdt. 7 . 99 . 2 -3 ). Kos (no. 497 ) may have controlled the island of Nisyros c. 500 (Hdt. 7 . 99 with Hicks in Paton and Hicks ( 1891 ) p. xii); but if so, Nisyros was independent by c. 478 (see infra ). Two ships from Nisyros fought under Artemisia's command at Salamis (Hdt. 7 . 99 . 2 ). Nisyros was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district ( IG i³ 269 . i . 8 ), but in 429 / 8 to the Island district ( IG i³ 282 . iii . 20 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 4 ) to 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 . ii . 30 ) a total of nine times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 tal. 3 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 4 ), reduced to 1 tal. in or before 442 / 1 ( IG i³ 270 . i . 9 ). After the end of the Peloponnesian War Nisyros fell under Spartan authority, for in 394 Diodorus mentions the island among the states brought by Pharnabazos and Konon to revolt ( 14 . 83 . 3 ). Throughout C4 Nisyros was independent (see Papachristodoulou ( 1989 ) 47 ). The protective deity, appropriately for a volcanic island (see Buchholz and Althaus ( 1982 ) 17 -18 , 21 -22 ), was probably Poseidon (see the coins; Ashton ( 1999 a ) 23 with ( 1999 b ) for the Knidian comparanda ); in a Heltic inscription he bears the epithet Argeios ( IG xii . 3 103 . 13 = Syll . ³ 673 ). Strabo mentions a sanctuary of Poseidon (Strabo 10 . 5 . 16 ). A remarkable law of C4s, inscribed on the outside of the city wall, declares that land lying 5 feet from the wall is public land ( δα µ όσιον χωρίον ) ( IG xii . 3 86 = Syll . ³ 936 = Maier ( 1959 -61 ) no. 47 )). The remains of the wall date at the earliest from after the earthquake of 413 (Buchholtz and Althaus ( 1982 ) 15 -16 ; see Bean and Cook ( 1957 ) 118 -19 ); it has been suggested to have been put up as part of Mausolos' strategy of fortifying sites under his control (Bean and Cook ( 1957 ) 142 ; Hornblower ( 1982 ) 331 -32 ; Sherwin-White ( 1978 ) 70 n. 212 is sceptical). The wall enclosed an area of 10 ha (Hoepfner ( 1999 ) 134 -35 ). A harbour is attested at Ps.-Skylax 99 . In C4 Nisyros struck coins in silver and bronze. ( 1 ) Silver drachms (only one genuine example known), which should probably be dated to C4m/e (Ashton ( 1999 a ) 23 ; ( 1999 c )). Types: obv . head of Aphrodite; rev . Poseidon seated with trident; legend: ΝΙΣΥΡΙΟΝ . ( 2 ) Bronze. Types: obv . head of Helios, or Aphrodite, or unidentified female head; rev . Aphrodite with rose, or dolphin, or grapes, or eagle, or cow or bull, or dolphin and trident; legend: ΝΙ or ΝΙΣΥ (Head, HN ² 635 ; SNG Cop. Caria 706 -8 , but 709 is not of Nisyros: see Ashton ( 1999 a ) 15 -16 )."
509,Paros (Parios),The Aegean,37.05,25.1,5409,25861,"509 . Paros (Parios) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 05 , long. 25 . 10 . Size of territory: 3 ( 196 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Πάρος , ηasper (Archil. fr. 89 . 22 ; Hymn. Hom. Ap . 44 ; Aesch. Pers . 884 ), denoting both the island (Hdt. 5 . 31 . 2 ) and the town (Ps.Skylax 58 ). The city-ethnic is Πάριος ( IG xii . 5 216 (C6l); Thuc. 4 . 104 . 4 ; Pl. Ap . 20 A-B). Paros is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 6 . 134 . 2 ; Isoc. 19 . 19 ; Ephor. fr. 63 ; Matthaiou and Kouragios ( 1992 -98 ) 438 -40 (C4s)) and in the political sense ( IG xii . 5 110 . 6 , 111 . 6 (both C4e); Matthaiou ( 1992 -98 b ) 430 -31 no. 3 (both C4m); Archil. fr. 13 . 2 ). The territorial sense is possibly attested in Archil. fr. 204 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in inscriptions ( IG xii . 5 110 . 6 , 111 . 6 (both C4e)) and in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ), and externally in inscriptions ( SEG 27 249 (C6l/C5e); IG i³ 263 . iv . 24 ; I.Délos 98 B. 5 ( 377 / 6 )) and in literary sources (Hdt. 6 . 133 . 1 -2 ; Pl. Menex . 245 B). For the individual and external use, see Hdt. 1 . 12 . 2 : Αρχίλοχος οasper Πάριος ; Lazzarini ( 1976 ) no. 304 (C6m); Syll . ³ 16 ; Arist. Pol . 1258 b 40 . Patris is found in Hdt. 6 . 135 . 2 . Strabo, citing Artemidoros, places Paros among the Kyklades (Strabo 10 . 5 . 3 ). Apart from the urban centre, Paros had many habitation sites in the Geometric and Archaic periods,and it remains unclear what relation they had to the main town centre of Archaic and later periods and to the formation of Paros as a unified polity. These settlements include ( 1 ) a fortified habitation site at Naoussa in the north-east quadrant of the island (Rubensohn ( 1901 ) 163 -70 , ( 1949 ) 1791 ; cf. also BCH 114 ( 1990 ) 818 , not in Barr .); ( 2 ) an Archaic fortified site with a building identified by the excavator as a 'temple' at Oikonomos (Schilardi ( 1973 ), ( 1975 b ) 93 ); ( 3 ) the Archaic 'acropolis' at Koukounaries (Berranger ( 1992 ) 121 ; Reger ( 1997 ) 460 ), which has recently been claimed as a full-blown polis with Athena as its tutelary deity (Schilardi ( 1996 )); ( 4 ) ' Υρίη (perhaps to be located at Marmara: Berranger ( 1992 ) 126 ; Rubensohn ( 1949 ) 1791 , misprinted as Hydria in Barr .; ( 5 ) Myrsineai ( IG xii . 5 244 ) was perhaps a civic subdivision of the Archaic period ( infra ) and seems well fixed by modern Piskopiana (Rubensohn ( 1901 ) 175 -76 ; Berranger ( 1992 ) 132 ); ( 6 ) at Dryos, recorded in Barr . conventionally as a settlement, perhaps of the Classical period, have been reported a tower and harbour fittings (Rubensohn ( 1901 ) 173 -74 , ( 1949 ) 1791 ). ( 7 )-( 8 ) We have from later periods names for a number of settlements on Paros; most of these are located only with some uncertainty, and none seems associated clearly with any of the settlements known archaeologically.They include Μάρπησσα (Steph. Byz. 434 . 6 ; Rubensohn ( 1901 ) 158 ), and Τε µ ένιον ( IG xii . 5 116 (C4 )), both unlocated. Paros was said to have been colonised by Arkadia, with Paros as the oecist (Heracl. Lemb. fr. 25 , from the Aristotelian Constitution of the Parians ). The Athenians call the Parians their apoikoi in 373 / 2 ( SEG 31 67 . 6 ). From a study of the fragments of the poetry of Archilochos, Lanzillotta has concluded that Paros was ruled by an aristocracy controlled by a few families in the Archaic period (Lanzillotta ( 1987 ) 58 -61 ; see also Berranger ( 1992 ) 328 -31 ). It may be doubted that Paros was actually under the control of Naxos (no. 507 ) in 499 (as at Hdt. 5 . 31 . 2 ; cf. Lanzillotta ( 1987 ) 105 -6 ). During the Archaic period the Parians and the Naxians fought a series of wars which imply naval and land forces (cf.Berranger ( 1992 ) 205 -7 ). It is in this context that a Milesian ambassador is said to have been rescued from a shipwreck by a dolphin ( IG xii . 5 445 . 10 -19 ). C. 655 -650 the Parians participated in arbitrating a dispute between Chalkis (no. 365 ) and Andros (no. 475 ) over Akanthos (no. 559 ) (Plut. Mor . 298 A-B; Piccirilli ( 1973 ) 7 -11 no. 2 ). C . 525 the Milesians (no. 854 ) requested Parian 'statereformers' ( καταρτιστηtildeρες ) to settle an internal dispute (Hdt. 5 . 28 -29 ). Paros was subdued by Persia during the reign of Dareios (Aesch. Pers . 882 ). The Parians sent a trireme to Marathon with the Persian expedition in 490 (Hdt. 6 . 133 . 1 ). In 489 Miltiades launched an expedition against the Parians, which failed (Hdt. 6 . 132 -36 ; for a different tradition, see Ephor. fr. 63 ). The Parians remained loyal to the Persians for the next decade (cf. Hdt. 8 . 67 . 1 with Lanzillotta ( 1987 ) 113 and Berranger-Auserve ( 2000 ) 88 ). After the battle of Salamis, Themistokles led another Athenian expedition against the Parians, who deterred him with a bribe (Hdt. 8 . 112 ). Soon thereafter they joined the Delian League ( ATL iii. 190 , 198 ). Paros belonged to the Island district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 24 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 24 ) a total of eleven times, four times completely restored, paying a phoros of 16 tal., 1 , 200 dr. in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 24 ), raised to 18 tal. in 446 / 5 ( IG i³ 266 . iv . 25 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 62 ) ( 30 tal.). The nature of the regime for most of C5 is unknown (Berranger-Auserve ( 2000 ) 93 ), though there was an oligarchy in the polis in 410 / 9 abolished by Theramenes when, supporting the demos , he restored democracy and imposed heavy fines on the oligarchs (Diod. 13 . 47 . 8 ). Probably soon after 407 the Parians helped effect a reconciliation between the Thasians (no. 526 ) and the Neapolitans (no. 634 ) ( IG xii . 5 109 with Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 178 -92 ; Piccirilli ( 1973 ) 144 -49 no. 33 ; Berranger-Auserve ( 2000 ) 94 -95 ); a bas-relief found at Delphi depicts the reconciliation (Moretti ( 1953 )). In C4e Paros came under the control of one Pasinos (Isoc. 19 . 18 ), and for a few years Paros was probably a tyranny or a narrow oligarchy (Gehrke, Stasis 125 ); but democracy was soon reintroduced: Plato ( Menex . 245 B) speaks of the Athenians fighting 'on behalf of the Parians'after the reconstruction of the long walls, probably c. 393 ; and shortly afterwards the Parians borrowed money from Apollo of Delos under the amphiktyony created by the Athenians (e.g. I.Délos 97 . 13 = IG ii² 1634 ( 391 / 0 )). That the Parians thereafter had a democratic government along Athenian lines is suggested most recently by the discovery of part of a kleroterion of Athenian style on the island, though the machine cannot be dated more closely than C4 -C2 (Müller ( 1998 )). The Parians joined the Second Athenian Naval League in 377 / 6 ( IG ii² 43 .A. 89 ). An important inscription of 373 / 2 , a rare example of a decision of the synedrion of the League, has recently been interpreted as an effort by the League, through the appointment of diallagai , to resolve bitter internal political factionalism among the Parians ( SEG 31 67 with now Dreher ( 1995 ) 109 -54 ; cf. also Matthaiou ( 1992 -98 b ) 435 n. 24 ). A Parian-Thasian sympoliteia should not be inferred,as some have,from the singular of demos in the phrase [ περ ] ιgrave τοgraveν δηtilde µ ο [ ν ] τοgrave [ µ ] Π [ α ] ρίων καιgrave Θασίων in an inscription of roughly 350 -330 ( IG xii . 5 114 . 10 -12 with p. 308 and IG xii suppl.p. 105 ; L. Robert ( 1935 ) 313 , ( 1960 b ) 525 n. 3 ; contra Berranger ( 1992 ) 311 -12 ; on IG xii suppl. 412 = CEG i 416 (C6 ), see now Pouilloux ( 1989 ) and N. Ehrhardt ( 1987 ), non vidi ; the objections of Juri Vinogradov, BE ( 1990 ) 499 , have much less force after the work of the Polis Centre). The Parians awarded the Athenian boule a crown in 348 / 7 ( IG ii² 1441 . 5 -7 ). The Parians received 10 , 000 medimnoi of grain from Kyrene (no. 1028 ) c. 330 ( SEG 9 2 . 29 = Tod 196 ; cf. Marasco ( 1992 )). The Aristotelian collection of politeiai included a Constitution of the Parians (Heracl. Lemb. 25 ). In C4 decrees were passed by the boule and the demos . They were published by the prytaneis ( IG xii . 5 110 . 10 ) or the grammateus ( IG xii . 5 118 . 5 ) at the expense of a tamias (Matthaiou ( 1992 -98 b ) 430 -31 no. 3 . 10 , 24 ). The eponymous official was the archon ( IG xii . 5 112 . 6 -7 = Migeotte ( 1984 ) 213 -15 no. 61 (C4 )) from no later than the lifetime of Archilochos ( IG xii . 5 445 . 8 -9 ). Other attested officials are theoroi and a neokoros ( IG xii . 5 108 = LSCG 205 -6 no. 111 (C5 )), theopropoi (Hdt. 6 . 135 . 2 ) and a hypostrategos ( IG xii . 5 1019 A (C4 -C3 ?)), although we must wait till C3 to hear of the strategoi themselves,here of course a political,not military,office ( IG xii . 5 220 ). Archilochos does mention, however, a military strategos in C7 (Archil. fr. 114 . 1 ; cf. 95 . 1 ). Parian envoys to Athens (no. 361 ) are mentioned in the Naval Synedrion's decree of 372 ( SEG 31 67 . 13 -14 ). Paros granted proxenia to citizens of Chios (no. 840 ) ( IG xii . 5 110 -11 (C4e)) and Athens ( IG xii . 5 114 + p. 308 ; SEG 48 1135 (all C4m)), and Parians received proxenia from Anaphe (no. 474 ) ( IG xii . 3 251 . 15 -17 (C4 ?)). Several Parian public enactments are preserved on inscriptions. They include a law of 475 -450 forbidding throwing rubbish in a public road ( IG xii . 5 107 = LSCG 202 -3 no. 108 ; Koerner ( 1993 ) 215 -17 no. 57 and SEG 45 1142 for the date), a law of C5forbidding cutting something, perhaps sacred trees ( IG xii . 5 108 = LSCG 205 -6 no. 111 ; Koerner ( 1993 ) 217 -19 no. 58 ), a C5 horos of (Zeus?) Hypatos forbidding access(?) to the uninitiated and to women ( IG xii . 5 183 = LSCG 203 no. 109 (C5 ), with, however, the reservations of Berranger ( 1992 ) 327 ), and what may be a law of c. 450 forbidding foreigners from participating in a cult ( IG xii . 5 225 = LSCG 204 -5 no. 110 , with the differing interpretations of Berranger ( 1992 ) 93 -95 and Butz ( 1996 ) 82 -86 ). The Parian state owned public land ( IG xii . 5 115 (C5 )). The civic organisation of Paros into demes has been inferred from the appearance of Αρχίλοχος Μυριναῖος on a vase in the Bosco Reale treasure (Rubensohn ( 1949 ) 1807 ). In an inscription of the Roman period Μυρσίνεαι is attested as the name of a village on Paros ( IG xii . 5 244 ; cf. SEG 28 709 ), and combining the two sources, it has been inferred that Myrrhineai must be the name of a Parian civic subdivision, possibly a deme (Berranger ( 1989 -90 )). Patrai are attested in a C4 dedication by the Dordopes to their Archegetes ( SEG 33 687 ; pace Lanzillotta ( 1987 ) 191 -94 ). Only one month of the Parian calendar, Anthesterion, is attested before 300 ( IG xii . 5 112 . 7 = Migeotte ( 1984 ) no. 61 (C4 )); for the four months attested later and a possible reconstruction, see Trümpy, Monat . 65 -72 . The protective deity was Athena Poliouchos ( IG xii . 5 134 . 17 (C4 -C3 ); the restoration of her epithet at 1029 . 5 is very likely because of the stoichedon arrangement, but cf. Berranger ( 1992 ) 72 -73 , 187 ), who helped the Parians in C7 in battle (Archil. fr. 94 ). Temple A ( c. 530 -520 ) on the Parian acropolis, where cult is attested from C7 , may be hers (Gruben ( 1982 b ) 221 , 229 with Rubensohn ( 1949 ) 1842 ; reservations: Berranger ( 1992 ) 71 -73 ). Athena is also Kynthie ( IG xii . 5 210 ; cf. Berranger ( 1992 ) 266 -67 no. 4 , with a date of 525 -500 ) and Pontie ( SEG 28 707 (C4 )). Demeter was worshipped from C7 on Paros ( Hymn. Hom. Dem . 491 ; see also Archil. frr. 169 and 322 ) and her Thesmophorion, still unlocated (Berranger ( 1992 ) 85 -90 ), played an important role in a story in Herodotos ( 6 . 134 . 2 ); her priests seem to have been called Κάβαρνοι (Hsch. Κ 8 , but see Hemberg ( 1950 ) 171 -72 ). Zeus is attested under multiple epithets: Aigiochos ( IG xii . 5 215 . 6 (C5e); Berranger ( 1992 ) 267 -69 no. 6 ), Elasteros ( IG xii . 5 1027 ( c. 500 ), as restored by Berranger ( 1992 ) 278 -80 no. 13 ; IG xii suppl. 208 ; BE ( 1963 ) 199 ; Matthaiou ( 1992 -98 b ) 424 -26 no. 1 (an altar with inscription dated to C6l) and 426 -30 nos. 2 -3 (which may be horoi of his sanctuary, see also Matthaiou ( 1999 )), Eleutherios ( SEG 26 978 (C5 )), once probably also as Patroios ( IG xii suppl. 208 (C4 ), following Berranger ( 1992 ) 186 ). There is also a horos of Hypatos of C5 which may be an epithet of Zeus ( IG xii . 5 183 = LSCG 203 no. 109 , with Berranger ( 1992 ) 185 ). This inscription comes from Mt. Kounados, where Zeus had a sanctuary that may be quite ancient.Apollo's cult was widespread with multiple epithets: Hekebolos ( IG xii . 5 148 (C5 ?); the deity is restored on the basis of the epithet); Delios ( Hymn. Hom. Ap . 44 ; IG xii . 5 214 (C4 ), a horos ; five further examples in BE ( 1964 ) 341 ), and with Artemis and Leto as the Delian triad in C5l (Matthaiou and Kouragios ( 1992 -98 ) 438 no. 2 ), Pythios ( IG xii . 5 134 . 8 + add. p. 309 ), whose Pythion was the archive for public documents ( IG xii . 5 110 . 9 -11 (C4 )); it is uncertain whether the Pythion is to be identified with the temple, surely Apollo's, located outside the city walls on a terrace above the Asklepieion and in use from C7 but reconstructed in C4f (Schuller ( 1982 b ) 245 -46 , 262 -64 ; Berranger ( 1992 ) 97 -103 for the doubts). Artemis appears without epithet and as Delios ( IG xii . 5 216 (C5 ), 211 (C4 )), and there is evidence for the cult of Hermes ( Αasper µ αξείτης , Ergon ( 1960 ) 184 ). Aphrodite (Matthaiou and Kouragios ( 1992 -98 ) 437 -38 no. 1 (C4f)), and Ge, although her cult may have been private rather than official (Despinis ( 1979 ) 228-29 ) (C4m)). Worship of the Charites, attested in C2 ( IG xii suppl. 206 ), would seem to go back much earlier (Apollod. Bibl . 3 . 15 . 7 . 7 ). Herakles, who had important mythological connections with Paros (Apollod. Bibl . 2 . 5 . 9 . 3 -6 ), is mentioned as Kallinikos by Archilochos (fr. 324 . 1 ). Dionysos appears in a catalogue ( IG xii . 5 134 . 9 ). Asklepios ( IG xii . 5 119 (C4 ), name not wholly clear) had a sanctuary outside the city, probably begun around C4s (Berranger ( 1992 ) 104 -5 ; Semeria ( 1986 ) 953 ). Hestia's cult, attested by an inscription of c. 525 -500 ( IG xii . 5 238 with Gruben ( 1982 a ) 673 ), was practised in a building that has been identified as a prytaneion (Gruben ( 1982 a ) 673 ). The Parians consulted oracles as a community with some frequency throughout their history; instances relating to Apollo at Delphi before 323 are recounted in a Heltic account of the founding of Thasos ( SEG 15 517 . ii . 43 -47 , 50 -52 with Anth. Pal . 14 . 113 and Berranger ( 1992 ) 178 -80 ), in Herodotos ( 6 . 135 . 2 -3 ) and in Diodorus ( 15 . 13 . 4 , before founding the colony at Pharos, after 385 ; cf. Fontenrose ( 1978 ) 248 -49 H 14 ). The polis centre was walled from perhaps as early as C7 , but certainly in C6 ; the wall encompassed the hill that served as the Parian acropolis, and much of its course has now been traced. It enclosed an area of c. 50 ha (Berranger ( 1992 ) 62 -65 ; Schilardi ( 1975 a ) 197 -203 with 198 fig. 1 ). More sections continue to be discovered (see Zapheiropoulou ( 1987 ) 490 -91 , ( 1990 ) 403 , ( 1992 ) 541 ). Some additional archaeological finds in the polis centre are discussed in Kouragios ( 1996 ). The wall is mentioned in literary sources (Hdt. 6 . 133 . 2 (rC6l); Ephor. fr. 63 (r 489 )). A C4s horos inscribed οasperacuteρος πόλεως was presumably set up to mark the line between the town ( polis ) and its hinterland (Hansen ( 1996 ) 37 with nn. 148 and 149 ) and/or between the town and its harbour (Gauthier in BE ( 1999 ) 420 ); for a different interpretation, see Matthaiou ( 1992 -98 b ) 441 -47 ). Paros had two harbours, one of which is described as closed ( κλειστός , Ps.-Skylax 58 ). For remains of the harbour, see Berranger ( 1992 ) 57 -58 . A prytaneion , mentioned in 207 / 6 ( I.Magnesia 50 . 67 -68 ), may have existed as early as C5 and was rebuilt in C4s (Gruben ( 1982 a ) 676 -83 ; see IG xii . 5 . 281 . 3 (undated)). Probable remains of a bouleuterion of C4 have been identified (Berranger-Auserve ( 2000 ) 101 ). Sanctuaries and cult sites include perhaps one of Poseidon up by Kargadousa (Rubensohn ( 1949 ) 1854 ; Schilardi ( 1975 b ) 95 (C5 or C4 ); Berranger ( 1992 ) 123 ), sites of Eileithyaia, Zeus Hypatos, and perhaps Aphrodite (C6 -C4 ) (Berranger ( 1992 ) 82 -85 ), which may be identical with the sanctuary reported on Kounados hill (Rubensohn ( 1901 ) 181 , 215 ) of C6m or earlier date (Ohnesorg ( 1994 ); Hübner ( 1994 )); Kore had a sanctuary in C5 ( IG xii . 5 225 = LSCG 205 no. 110 , with Berranger ( 1992 ) 93 -95 ), but whether this should be identified with Temple B on the Parian acropolis (as Gruben ( 1982 a ) 174 -79 ) is uncertain (Berranger ( 1992 ) 241 ); Apollo Delios was worshipped at the famous Delion a few kilometres north of town on a hill called Kynthos (Rubensohn ( 1962 ); cf. Schuller ( 1982 a ); Berranger ( 1992 ) 81 -82 ; for a horos , see IG xii . 5 214 (C4 )), which included a temple of Artemis (Schuller ( 1991 )); a sanctuary of Apollo (possibly the Pythion, but see Berranger ( 1992 ) 97 -103 ) and an Asklepieion were located on a hill east of town that may also house the Thesmophorion (Berranger ( 1992 ) 90 -105 ), which was in any case outside the city walls (Hdt. 6 . 134 . 2 ), and another sanctuary for Demeter Karpophoros based on a dedication (Schilardi ( 1977 ) 376 -77 ). Finally, there was the famous sanctuary of Archilochos, the Archilocheion, built about 350 , where his poetry and a biography were inscribed and whose location is still a matter for uncertainty (though it is probably at Elitas, as often suggested: Ohnesorg ( 1982 ); cf. Berranger ( 1992 ) 108 -12 ). Further from the central polis , a temple of Athena has been discovered at Koukounaries dating from c. 700 into C4 (Schilardi ( 1996 ) 42 -53 ). Evidence of several temples of Archaic or Classical date has come to light near the bay of Marmara; that at least one sanctuary existed there is proved by an inscription of Classical date ( IG xii . 5 256 ; cf. Schnieringer ( 1982 ) and Berranger ( 1992 ) 125 -29 ). Paros struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard from c. 525 . The earliest are staters. Types: obv . kneeling goat facing left accompanied by a fish/dolphin, or goat looking right, or goat within circle of pearls, or goat turning left, or leaping goat; rev . incuse square sometimes with star. These continued into C5e, with the addition of two goats butting heads to the reverse types. c. 510 -480 , drachms were struck. Types: obv . goat looking right, with or without a circlet of pearls; legend on some: ΠΑ or ΠΑΡΙ ; rev . incuse square, or goat looking back (Berranger ( 1992 ) 283 -89 ). An epigram of Simonides (C6s-C5f) refers to a statue of Artemis costing 200 Parian dr. (Simon. fr. 114 , Diehl, from Diog. Laert. 4 . 45 ). Coinage was resumed in 357 on the Rhodian standard (after 338 according to Berranger-Auserve ( 2000 ) 109 -10 ). Denominations: tetradrachms, didrachms, drachms. Silver types: obv . goat; legend on some: ΠΑΡ ; rev . ear of grain, or wreaths of grain: legend: ΠΑ or ΠΑΡΙ or ΠΑΡΙΩΝ . Bronze types: obv . goat facing right or left, or female head (possibly Demeter); rev . ear of grain, or goat (Head, HN ² 489 ; SNG Cop. Aegean Islands 715 -20 ; Berranger ( 1992 ) 283 -89 ; Sheedy ( 1996 )). The Parians colonised Parion (no. 756 ) in Asia Minor c. 708 with the Milesians (no. 854 ) and the Erythrians (no. 845 ) (Strabo 13 . 1 . 14 ; Euseb. Chron . 2 , 18 th Olymp. 1 ; Berranger ( 1992 ) 168 -69 ), and Thasos (no. 526 ) c. 710 -680 under the oecist Telesikles, the poet Archilochos' father (Thuc. 4 . 104 . 4 ; Strabo 10 . 5 . 7 ( 487 ); Steph. Byz. 306 . 20 -307 . 2 ; Berranger ( 1992 ) 170 -84 , esp. 176 -78 on the date of 680 inferred from IG xii . 5 444 . 48 -49 ( FGrHist 239 ); for Herakles'mythological role, see Apollod. Bibl . 2 . 5 . 9 . 13 ). One thousand men are said to have been dispatched ( IG xii . 5 445 . iv . 22 , quoting Archil. fr. 97 ). Continued close political relations between Paros and its colony Thasos are attested in an epigram of C6l in which a certain Akeratos boasts that he (alone) had held high office in both poleis ( IG xii suppl. 412 ; CEG i 416 ; see Graham ( 1983 ) 74 -76 ). It is possible that the Parians were involved in C6e or C5s in Eion (no. 630 ) (Lazaridis ( 1976 ); Berranger ( 1992 ) 169 -70 ). At some time, but possibly later (the date remains very uncertain), Paros may have tried to found a colony at Anchiale in the Adriatic (Steph.Byz. 24 . 13 ; Berranger ( 1992 ) 162 -64 ). Pharos (no. 84 ), originally called Paros (so Strabo 7 . 5 . 5 ), followed in 385 / 4 (Steph. Byz. 659 . 7 , from Ephor. fr. 89 ; Diod. 15 . 4 ; Parke and Wormell ( 1956 ) 2 . 76 no . 177 , 164 , no . 429 ; L. Robert ( 1935 ); see also ( 1960 b )). Oliaros ( ' Ωλίαρος : Ps.-Skylax 48 ; Strabo 10 . 5 . 3 ) and Prepesinthos ( Πρεπέσινθος : Strabo 10 . 5 . 3 ), the two small islands west of Paros (Map 60 , inset), have been suggested, reasonably,as dependencies of Paros (Lanzillotta ( 1987 ) 190 ; Sherk ( 1990 ) 278 ). Steph. Byz. 708 . 9 -12 reports that Oliaros was a colony ( apoikia ) of the Sidonians. IG xii . 5 471 is from Siphnos, not Oliaros (cf. IG xii suppl. p. 111 ; SEG 33 680 ). P eparethos (P eparethios ) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 05 , long. 23 . 45 . Size of territory: 2 ( 97 km ² ). The toponym is Πεπάρηθος , ηasper ( Hymn. Hom. Ap . 32 ; Dem. 18 . 70 ), denoting both the island (Soph. Phil . 548 -49 ) and one of the towns (Dem. 35 . 35 ; Steph. Byz. 516 . 23 -24 ). The city-ethnic is Πεπαρήθιος ( IG i³ 270 . iii . 10 ; Anaximenes ( FGrHist 72 ) fr. 41 = Dem. 12 . 12 ). In the so-called Charter of the Second Athenian Naval League,Peparethos is listed under the heading polis ( IG ii² 43 .A. 78 and 85 ). Peparethos is called a polis in the urban sense by Dem. 35 . 35 and in Ps.-Skylax 58 , where the island is described as τρίπολις καιgrave λι µ ήν (cf. Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 156 ). The principal polis was Peparethos; the names of the other two poleis were Panormos (Diod. 15 . 95 . 2 ; Polyaen. Strat . 6 . 2 ) and Seleinous ( IG xii . 8 661 . 3 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ) and externally in inscriptions ( CEG i 325 . 2 = F. Delphes iii . 4 179 ( 480 / 79 )) and in literary sources (Pl. Alc . 116 D).For the individual and external use, see the Athenian naval list of C5l ( IG i³ 1033 . 85 -86 ). Peparethos is listed among the Kyklades by Ps.-Skylax ( 58 ) and Diodorus ( 15 . 30 . 5 , 95 . 1 ), whereas the island is described by Strabo at 9 . 5 . 16 as one of the islands off Magnesia, and at 2 . 5 . 21 it is classed with the islands lying off Greece as far as Makedonia and Thrace. According to Ps.Skymnos 580 and 586 , Peparethos was colonised by the Chalkidians from Euboia. Fighting on the Greek side in the Persian War, the Peparethians captured two Karian ships at Salamis and dedicated one tenth of the booty to Apollo at Delphi ( CEG i 325 = F.Delphes iii . 4 179 ). The Peparethians were members of the Delian League.They belonged to the Thracian district ( IG i³ 269 . iii . 10 ) and are recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 18 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . iii . 7 ) a total of seventeen times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 3 tal. ( IG i³ 261 . iii . 5 ). They were assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 169 ). Under Spartan hegemony from the end of the Peloponnesian War until Chabrias' expedition in the Aegean in 377 / 6 (Diod. 15 . 30 . 5 ), the Peparethians joined the Second Athenian Naval League in the 370 s ( IG ii² 43 .A. 85 ). In 362 / 1 (Hansen ( 1975 ) 95 ) the island was attacked by forces of Alexander of Pherai, which beseiged Peparethos town. The Athenians dispatched assistance, trapped Alexander's forces in Panormos and laid siege to the town; he extracted them after a successful sea battle in which one Peparethian and five Athenian triremes were captured (Diod. 15 . 95 . 1 -2 ; Polyaen. Strat . 6 . 2 . 1 ; Dreher ( 1995 ) 29 -30 ). C. 342 the Peparethians conquered Halonnesos, which by then was garrisoned by the Makedonians, but Philip of Makedon deprived them soon after of the possession of this island, and in 340 he attacked and ravaged Peparethos (Dem. 12 . 12 -15 , 18 . 70 with schol. no. 128 , Dilts). In, probably, 338 Peparethos was made subject to Makedonia (Strabo 9 . 5 . 16 ). The only piece of evidence we have about the political institutions is a casual remark in Plato that one may advise the Peparethians, probably in their assembly ( Alc . 116 D). We hear of two communal dedications at Delphi: one of booty from Salamis in 480 ( supra = Jacquemin ( 1999 ) 346 no. 387 ), the other a gold crown of laurels recorded probably by Theopomp.fr. 248 and so C4 or earlier. Hagnon Peparethios was Olympic victor in 568 ( Olympionikai 97 ). The Peparethians struck mostly anepigraphic silver coins on the Euboic standard c. 520 -480 . Denominations: tetradrachms, didrachms, tetrobols. Types: obv . single and triple grape clusters,or grape cluster with four dolphins; rev . incuse square with a winged running figure ('Agon' or 'Boreas' , Balcer ( 1967 ) 29 ), or head of Herakles, or crested Corinthian helmet, or rosette, or dolphin rider in incuse square, or Dionysos or Staphylos. The last bears on the obv. the legend ΠΕ . A new series, all bronze, starts after c. 350 . Types: obv . Dionysos, or Athena; rev . kantharos, or thyrsos, or grapes; legend: ΠΕ or ΠΕΠΑ (Head, HN ² 312 -13 ; Balcer ( 1967 ), ( 1975 ); Kraay ( 1976 ) 119 -20 ; Wartenberg ( 1998 ) 368 -69 ; SNG Cop.Thessaly 359 -60 )."

Panormos is implicitly referred to as a polis in the urban sense by the term τρίπολις at Ps.-Skylax 58 . It is the second polis of the island, known best from Diodorus' narrative of a siege by Alexander of Pherai in 361 / 0 (Diod. 15 . 95 . 1 -2 ; Polyaen. 6 . 2 . 1 ). The site was fortified in C4m (see Diod. 15 . 95 . 2 ; Fredrich ( 1906 b ) 117 -21 , but see Scranton ( 1941 ) 170 ). Panormos is best regarded as a dependent polis of Peparethos."

The toponym is Πεπάρηθος , ηasper (Dem. 18 . 70 ); The city-ethnic is Πεπαρήθιος ( IG i³ 270 . iii . 10 ). The urban centre of Peparethos was walled by 426 and had a prytaneion (Thuc. 3 . 89 . 4 ; S. G. Miller ( 1978 ) nos. 384 -86 ). A sanctuary of C4l/C3e dedicated to Asklepios lay about 1 km east of the modern town (Liagkouras ( 1962 )). Six other possible sanctuary sites have been identified, including two-above the main town and at Panaghia Polemistria (Fredrich ( 1906 b ) 115 -16 , 117 )-that may have belonged to Athena Polias, who served as the protective deity (Herbst ( 1937 ) 556 ). Another of these sites, which includes a terrace with polygonal blocks,may date to C5 (Fredrich ( 1906 b ) 127 )."
512,Seleinous,The Aegean,,,164,845,"512 . Seleinous Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 10 , long 23 . 40 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: A. No toponym is attested. The city-ethnic is Σελεινουacuteσιος ( IG vii . 8 661 (Roman Imperial)).Seleinous is implicitly referred to as a polis in the urban sense by the term τρίπολις at Ps.-Skylax 58 . The only explicit testimony for Seleinous as a polis is an inscription of Roman imperial date, at which time the island was under Athenian control ( IG xii . 8 661 . 3 ). It has been identified as a polis from C4mainly because Ps.-Skylax says that Peparethos was tripolate, and it is the only other known candidate. But city walls are preserved at Seleinous that have been dated to C4 , and a temple has been reported (Fredrich ( 1906 b ) 122 -23 ; but see Scranton ( 1941 ) 168 on the walls). Seleinous is best regarded as a dependent polis of Peparethos."
513,Pholegandros (Pholegandrios),The Aegean,36.4,24.55,396,1823,"513 . Pholegandros (Pholegandrios) Map 60 (inset). Lat. 36 . 40 , long. 24 . 55 . Size of territory: 2 ( 32 km ² ). Type: B. The toponym is Φολέγανδρος , ηasper ( IG i³ 71 . i . 87 ; Strabo 10 . 5 . 1 ) or Φελέγανδρος ( F.Delphes iii . 1 497 . 15 (C4l/C3e)). The cityethnic is Φολεγάνδριος ( IG xii . 5 9 (C4 )); Solon fr. 2 . 1 ; Hsch. F 761 ). Pholegandros is not called a polis in any source, but deserves inclusion as being probably a polis because ( 1 ) Solon (fr. 2 ) mentions the possibility that, changing his patris , he might become a Pholegandrios or a Sikinites instead of an Athenaios; ( 2 ) because the island was a paying member of the Delian League ( infra ); and ( 3 ) because we possess a C4 proxeny decree passed by the Pholegandrians; for the date, see Brun ( 1996 ) 299 . The collective form of the city-ethnic appears internally in the proxeny decree ( IG xii . 5 9 . 15 ) and externally in the Solonian poem (fr. 2 ). Steph. Byz. 669 . 17 assigns the island to the Sporades. Pholegandros was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Island district, but is absent from the full panel of 441 / 0 ( IG i³ 271 . i -ii . 88 -101 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 87 ) for 2 , 000 dr. and is recorded in the tribute lists in 417 / 16 ( IG i³ 288 . i . 7 ) and 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 25 ) paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. In the assessment decree it is recorded by toponym. In the tribute lists the city-ethnic is restored by the editors, but the toponym is an equally possible restoration. What we know about the political institutions comes from a C4 proxeny decree for a citizen of Ios (no. 484 ), to be set up in the sanctuary of Apollo Pythios on Ios where the stone was found.The decree was passed by the boule and the demos of the Pholegandrians ( IG xii . 5 9 )."
514,"Rheneia (Rhenaieus, Rheneus)",The Aegean,37.25,25.15,564,2598,"514 . Rheneia (Rhenaieus, Rheneus) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 25 , long. 25 . 15 . Size of territory: 1 ( 14 km ² ). Type: A. ' Ρήνεια , ηasper (Thuc. 3 . 104 . 2 ; Hyp. fr. 74 , Sauppe; IG i³ 402 . 11 , 1460 . 20 ) or ' Ρήναια , ηasper ( Hymn. Hom. Ap . 44 ; Hdt. 6 . 97 . 1 ; Strabo 10 . 5 . 5 ) or ' Ρήνη , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 58 ; Steph.Byz. 544 . 17 ). The toponym denotes both the island (Thuc. 3 . 194 . 2 ) and the city (Hyp. fr. 74 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ρηναιευacuteς ( IG i³ 1636 .A. 4 (C4m)) or ' Ρηνευacuteς (Hyp.fr. 74 ). In Hypereides'Delian speech Rheneia is called a polis both in the urban and in the political sense (Hyp. fr. 74 ). The collective form of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 262 . i . 22 ) and in Hypereides' Delian speech (fr. 74 ). The individual and external form is attested in inscriptions ( I.Délos 104 -3 A. 4 (C4f); IG i³ 1636 A. 4 (C4m)). Rheneia is listed among the Kyklades in Ps.-Skylax 58 , but Strabo does not mention it in his list ( 10 . 5 . 3 ). In C6s Rheneia was conquered by Polykrates of Samos, who dedicated the island to Apollo (Thuc. 1 . 13 . 6 , 3 . 104 . 2 ). Rheneia was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Island district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 262 . i . 22 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 14 ) a total of eleven times, three times completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. in 451 / 0 , reduced to 300 dr. in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 29 ), but raised to 500 dr. in or before 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 14 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 82 ) for 1 , 000 dr. The preserved fragments of Hypereides' speech entitled Deliakos logos (fr. xii, Sauppe) testify to a lawsuit c. 344 / 3 (Dem. 18 . 134 ) between the Rheneians and the Delians (no. 478 ) over responsibility for the death of Aiolian visitors to Delos whose bodies were found on Rheneia.It appears from the fragments that Rheneia did not even possess a harbour ( limen ) and that the distance from the landing-place facing Delos to the urban centre was 30 stadia (fr. 74 ). Much of the southern half of the island was under Delian control, whether as cemeteries for Delos or as estates belonging to Apollo (see supra 740 ). When Delos was purified in 426 / 5 , all remains from the tombs were removed, presumably to Rheneia (Thuc. 3 . 104 . 2 ). Excavations at the urban centre of Rheneia,located on the west coast of the northern half of the island, revealed the remains of an undated temple of Herakles (Charre and Couilloud-Le Dinahet ( 1999 ) 135 n. 3 )."
515,Samothrake (Samothrax),The Aegean,40.3,25.35,1465,7084,"515 . Samothrake (Samothrax) Map 57 . Lat. 40 . 30 , long. 25 . 35 . Size of territory: 3 ( 178 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Σα µ οθρΩsubiotaάκη , ηasper (Ar. Pax 277 ; Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 7 ), in the Ionian dialect Σα µ οθρηsubiotaήκη (Hdt. 2 . 51 . 3 ), denoting both the island (Hdt. 2 . 51 . 3 ) and the town (Ps.-Skylax 67 , Klausen).An alternative, allegedly earlier toponym is Λευκανία , η (Arist. frr. 596 -97 ). The city-ethnic is Σα µ οθρΩsubiotaάξ ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 13 ; Herzog ( 1899 ) 17 -21 no. 6 . 1 (C3 ); I.Lindos ii 93 b. 5 (C3s)). Samothrake is called a polis in the political sense in an inscription of C4m or 350 -325 (Fraser ( 1960 ) 21 no. 1 . 3 -4 ), and is implicitly called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.Skylax 67 . The MS has Σα µ οθρΩsubiotaάκη κατατ καιgrave λι µ ήν . Klausen restores Σα µ οθρΩsubiotaάκη καταgrave ταυacuteτας καιgrave λι µ ήν , which seems to be a much more convincing restoration than καταgrave ταυtildeτα Σα µ οθρΩsubiotaάκη νηtildeσος καιgrave λι µ ήν preferred in GGM byMüller following Voss (for καιgrave λι µ ήν , see FlenstedJensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in the C4 proxeny decree (Fraser ( 1960 ) 21 no. 1 . 3 -4 , convincingly restored) and on coins of C5f ( infra ), and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 25 ) and in literature (Hdt. 2 . 51 . 2 -3 ; PCG , Adespota fr. 1063 . 15 ). For the individual and external use, see the Athenian naval list of C5l ( IG i³ 1032 . vi . 84 , as restored in IG ii² 1951 ). Ps.-Skylax 67 places Samothrake in Thrace, and Strabo classes Samothrake with the islands lying off Greece as far as Makedonia and Thrace ( 2 . 5 . 21 ). Accounts of the colonisation of the island found in Classical sources derive from a combination of the toponyms Samos and Thrake, whether because Samothrake was settled by exiles from Samos (no. 864 ) and was near Thrace (Ant. fr. 1 . 1 , Gernet; Paus. 7 . 4 . 3 ; Strabo 10 . 2 . 17 commenting on Hom. Il . 13 . 13 ) or because the island was settled first by Thracians and then by Samians (Heracl. Lemb. 49 ; schol. Hom. Il . 24 . 78 , both derived from Aristotle; Diod. 5 . 48 . 1 ); these Samians are said to have been expelled by a tyrant (Heracl. Lemb. 49 , derived from Aristotle; Suda Σ 79 citing Antiphon); for a collection of all sources, see Graham ( 2002 ) 232 -39 . Herodotos reports that the Pelasgians who fled Athens settled there ( 2 . 51 ). A recent review of all the evidence places the arrival of Greeks from Samos in C6f (Graham ( 2002 ); for a date of 700 from the archaeological record, see Lazarides ( 1971 ) 18 ). The Samothrakians came under Persian domination in C5e, and at least one Samothrakian ship participated in the battle of Salamis on the Persian side (Hdt. 8 . 90 . 2 ). Samothrake was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 63 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 13 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 31 ) a total of twenty-one times,three times completely restored, paying a phoros of 6 tal. ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 13 ), reduced to 2 tal. in 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 16 ). It was presumably assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 158 ( 15 tal.), completely restored). Antiphon delivered a speech On the Tribute of the Samothrakians (fr. 1 , Gernet),which should be associated either with the reduction in tribute in 430 / 29 (see Lazaridis ( 1971 ) 20 ) or with the new assessment of 425 / 4 (Gernet's preface 161 ). In 404 / 3 the island fell under the control of the Spartans (anecdote in Plut. Mor . 229 D), but in 389 / 8 the Athenians recovered the island (Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 7 ), and in the 370 s the Samothrakians joined the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 .B. 8 ). By C5e at the latest, Samothrake controlled a peraia on the Thracian mainland opposite (Hdt. 7 . 59 . 2 , 108 . 2 ) comprising the poleis of Drys (no. 644 ) (Ps.-Skylax 67 ), Masambrie (no. 647 ) (Hdt. 7 . 108 . 2 ), Sale (no. 649 ) (Hdt. 7 . 59 . 2 ) and Zone (no. 651 ) (Hdt. 7 . 59 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 67 ) and a fortification called Charakoma (Strabo 7 fr. 47 , infra 871 ). They lost their peraia by 422 / 1 ; it was recovered after the end of the Peloponnesian War, then lost again in C4m (Gschnitzer ( 1958 ) 32 -34 ; IG xii . 8 p. 40 ). The Aristotelian collection of politeiai included a Constitution of the Samothrakians (frr. 596 -97 ; Heracl. Lemb. 49 ). But almost all the information we have about political institutions is Heltic or later. The only preserved public enactment of the Classical period is a grant of proxenia to a citizen of an unknown polis (Fraser ( 1960 ) 21 no. 1 . 6 ( c. 350 -325 )), and in 345 / 4 the Samothrakians offered a series of crowns to Athens (no. 361 ) ( IG ii² 1443 . ii . 108 -14 ). Diod. 5 . 48 . 1 reports a system of five phylai ; the reference is to primordial times, but the myth may be aetiological (Jones, POAG 186 ). The protective deity appears to have been Athena (see Lehmann-Hartleben ( 1939 ) 144 ), whose sanctuary served as the civic archive, at least in the Heltic period ( IG xii . 8 153 . 10 -11 (C3 )). But Samothrake was most famous for its great sanctuary of the Kabeiroi; earliest cult activity at the site has been dated to C7 or earlier, and building began in C6 , with considerable elaboration in C4 (Hdt. 2 . 51 . 2 -3 ; cf. Strabo 10 . 3 . 19 -21 ; Hemberg ( 1950 ) 49 -131 ; Lehmann ( 1969 ) 2 . 51 -70 ; Lehmann and Spittle ( 1982 ) 269 ; Cole ( 1984 ) 10 -20 ; for a collection of literary sources, see N. Lewis ( 1958 ) 63 -112 ; for a synoptic overview of what we know of the cult, which included mysteries, see Burkert ( 1993 )). The round building on Samothrake in the sanctuary, dated to 289 -281 and sometimes regarded as a bouleuterion , is actually a cult structure (Gneisz ( 1990 ) 350 -51 no. 58 ). Aphrodite and Pothos were worshipped within the sanctuary of the Great Gods (Lehmann and Spittle ( 1982 ) i. 277 -89 ). A sanctuary to Artemis is reported to have been founded before the arrival of the Greek colonists ( BCH 118 ( 1994 ) 779 ). The urban centre was walled from C7 -C6 (Scranton ( 1941 ) 31 -33 , 154 ; Lazaridis ( 1971 ) 19 ). The preserved walls of, probably, C6 , with later repairs, enclose an area of c. 20 ha (H. Ehrhardt ( 1985 ) 25 -30 ). Otherwise very little seems to have been published about the urban centre, as archaeological work has concentrated on the sanctuary. A harbour is recorded at Ps.-Skylax 67 . The Samothrakians struck largely anepigraphic silver coins c. 500 -465 in two series. Denominations: staters, triobols and smaller fractions. Types: obv . Sphinx, or Athena; rev . incuse square, sometimes with lion's head, sometimes with bearded head with Corinthian helmet.A few examples bear legends: ΣΑΜΟ or ΣΑ (Schwabacher ( 1938 ), ( 1952 ); IGCH no. 696 ; Erxleben ( 1970 ) 117 ; Schönert Geiss ( 1996 ) 271 -72 ; SNG Cop. Thrace 991 ). No coins are known after c. 465 ; the next series begins about 280 (Head, HN ² 263 )."
516,Saros (Sarios),The Aegean,35.55,27.15,498,2407,"516 . *Saros (Sarios) Map 60 (inset). Lat. 35 . 55 , long. 27 . 15 . Size of territory: 1 ( 23 km ² ). Type: B. No toponym is attested (Susini ( 1963 -64 ) 245 ) but one is inferred from the ethnic Σάριος ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 21 , 290 . i . 4 ). The Sarioi were members of the Delian League and are recorded twice in the tribute lists, in 428 / 7 paying a phoros of 300 dr. ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 21 ) and in 415 / 14 paying a phoros of 200 dr. ( IG i³ 290 . i . 4 ). The Sarioi are absent from the full panel of 441 / 0 ( IG i³ 271 . i -ii . 64 -86 ). Mattingly (( 1996 ) 77 n. 27 ) has suggested that Saros may have been brought under Athenian control by Lysikles in 426 . A private dedication 'to all gods' , is known from C4e ( IG xii . 1 1040 ; Susini ( 1963 -64 ) 246 for date). It has been suggested that a village on Saros called τοgrave Αacuteργος must have had a Classical origin (Susini ( 1963 -64 ) 244 ; cf. Hiller von Gaertringen ( 1892 ) 309 ; I.Lindos p. 1013 ), but no ancient remains have been found there (Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1962 ) 168 ). It has sometimes been argued that Saros was one of the entities included under Karpathos (Papachristodoulou ( 1989 ) 45 ), but this seems unlikely. Karpathos had three poleis according to Ps.-Skylax, and all are accounted for by written and archaeological evidence placing them on the island. Strabo alone ( 10 . 5 . 17 ) attributes four poleis to the island of Karpathos, but to accept his view as attesting to Saros as a fourth polis requires identifying his Nisyros as Saros (so Dawkins ( 1902 -3 ) 204 , followed by Bürchner ( 1919 ) 2003 ), or supposing that Saros had two poleis (as pointed out by Susini ( 1963 -64 ) 245 ; see also Fraser and Bean ( 1954 ) 141 -42 ). This is convoluted, and it is easier and better simply to see Strabo's four as an error (Reger ( 1997 ) 453 and supra 745 ). It is just possible that Saros could have been part of Brykous (no. 487 ), for the two are never listed together in ATL . If so, they will have been separated later, when Karpathos and Saros were incorporated into the Rhodian state,for both Σάριος and Βρυκουacuteντιος appear as demotics ( IG xii . 1 1010 -1011 , 220 -23 , etc.). However, the evidence of the tribute lists is fragmentary and inconclusive. While certainty in this matter is perhaps impossible, it seems simplest to suppose that Saros was in fact a separate entity in C5 and C4 ."
517,Seriphos (Seriphios),The Aegean,37.1,24.3,640,2973,"517 . Seriphos (Seriphios) Map 60 (inset). Lat. 37 . 10 , long. 24 . 30 . Size of territory: 2 ( 75 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Σέριφος , ηasper (Cratinus, PCG fr. 225 ; Isoc. 19 . 9 ; SEG 36 331 .A. 11 ( 323 / 2 )), denoting both the island (Pind. Pyth . 12 . 12 ) and the town (Ps.-Skylax 58 ). The city-ethnic is Σερίφιος ( IG i³ 262 . i . 20 ; Pl. Resp . 329 E-330 A). Seriphos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Ps.-Skylax 58 ) and in the political sense (Isoc. 19 . 9 ), and in the accounts of the Delian amphiktyones the Seriphians are recorded under the heading αιasperacuteδε τῶν πόλεων ( I.Délos 98 A. 12 = IG ii² 1635 ( 377 / 6 -375 / 4 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on C3 coins (Head, HN ² 490 ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 262 . i . 20 ) and as the title of a comedy by Kratinos (Cratinus, PCG frr. 218 -32 ). For the individual and external use, see the Karthaian C4m list of proxenoi , of whom at least one is a citizen of Seriphos ( IG xii . 5 542 . 48 ), and Plato's report of the exchange of words between Themistokles and an unnamed Seriphian (Pl. Resp . 329 E; Plut. Them . 18 . 3 ). Stephanos assigns the island to the Sporades, whereas Strabo 10 . 5 . 3 , quoting Artemidoros, assigns it to the Kyklades. Seriphos was considered a small polis , and its almost proverbial insignificance is reflected in several sources (Pl. Resp . 329 E-330 A; Isoc. 19 . 9 ; Stob. Flor . 3 . 39 . 29 ); for the ancient (and modern) insignificance of Seriphos, see Brun ( 1993 a ). Seriphos was allegedly colonised by Ionians from Athens (Hdt. 8 . 48 ). In 490 the Seriphians refused the Persian demand to surrender,and Seriphos fought on the Greek side in the Persian War, contributing one ship (Hdt. 8 . 46 . 4 , 48 ). Seriphos was a member of the Delian League and probably among the original members ( ATL iii. 198 ). It belonged to the Island district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 262 . i . 20 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 11 ) a total of fourteen times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 2 tal. in 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 262 . i . 20 ) but 1 tal. in all subsequent years ( IG i³ 264 . iv . 2 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 76 ) for 2 tal. Seriphos may have been a member of the Second Athenian Naval League ( I.Délos 98 A. 12 ; Cargill ( 1981 ) 37 ; but see Dreher ( 1995 ) 24 . 1 , 245 -47 ). In C4s Seriphos had a theorodokos to host theoroi from Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .A. 11 -13 ( 331 / 0 -313 )). There are virtually no remains of the ancient town of Seriphos, which lay beneath modern Seriphos (cf. BCH 119 ( 1995 ) 998 ). The temenos of Perseus and altars of Diktys and Klymene which Pausanias says were erected by the Athenians ( 2 . 18 . 1 ) perhaps belong to C5 . Seriphos apparently minted staters in C6 on the Aiginetan standard with a frog on the obverse; see IGCH no. 4 and Erxleben ( 1970 ) 73 ."

The toponym is Σίκινος , ηasper ( IG xii suppl. 177 . 6 (C4l); Strabo 10 . 5 . 1 ; Steph. Byz. 568 . 17 ), denoting both the island (Ap. Rhod. 1 . 624 ) and the town (Ps.-Skylax 48 ). The city-ethnic is Σικινήτης (Solon fr. 2 . 1 ; IG i³ 71 . i . 90 ). Sikinos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Ps.-Skylax 48 ) and in the political sense ( IG xii . 5 24 . 5 ; for the date, see Rhodes, DGS 289 ). Solon refers to it by implication as a patris (fr. 2 . 2 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic appears internally on C3 coins (Head, HN ² 491 ) and in a proxeny decree of C4l ( IG xii suppl. 177 . 2 , 5 ) and externally in inscriptions ( IG i³ 287 . i . 16 ; IG ii² 43 .B. 31 ) and in literature (Solon fr. 2 . 1 ). Sikinos is usually placed among the Kyklades (Lauffer ( 1989 ) 614 ), but Steph. Byz. 568 . 17 , citing Strabo ( 10 . 5 . 1 ), calls it 'an island by Krete' . Apart from the urban centre at modern Ag. Marina, no other settlements are known. Sikinos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Island district and is recorded in the tribute lists in 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . i . 16 ), 417 / 16 ( IG i³ 288 . i . 6 ) and 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 17 ) paying a phoros of 500 dr. It is absent from the full panel of 441 / 0 ( IG i³ 271 . i -ii . 89 -101 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 90 ) for 1 , 000 dr. Sikinos joined the Second Athenian Naval League in the 370 s ( IG ii² 43 .B. 31 ). Sikinos awarded proxenia and other benefits to a citizen of Athens (no. 361 ) ( IG xii suppl. 177 (C4l)) and to one of Paros (no. 509 ) ( IG xii . 5 24 (C4l/C3e)). Our only source for the political institutions is the proxeny decree for the Parian ( IG xii . 5 24 ). Decrees were passed by the boule and the demos (ll. 2 -3 ; cf. ll. 12 -13 ); they were published by a board of archontes (ll. 19 -20 ) and set up in the sanctuary of Apollo Pythios (l. 18 ) at the expense of a board of praktores (l. 21 ). For the urban centre, walls and an agora are mentioned (Lauffer ( 1989 ) 614 -15 ), but the remains have not been studied carefully."
519,Siphnos (Siphnios),The Aegean,37.0,24.45,1315,6196,"519 . Siphnos (Siphnios) Map 60 (inset). Lat. 37 . 00 , long. 24 . 45 . Size of territory: 2 ( 74 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Σίφνος , ηasper (Hdt. 3 . 58 . 1 ; Isoc. 19 . 7 ), denoting both the island (Theophr. Lap . 42 ) and the town (Hdt. 3 . 57 . 4 ; Ps.-Skylax 58 ). The city-ethnic is Σίφνιος (Hdt. 3 . 57 . 2 ; IG iv 839 . 6 (C4 )). Siphnos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 3 . 58 . 1 ; Isoc. 19 . 19 , 38 -39 ) and in the political sense (Isoc. 19 . 10 ; IG iv 839 . 5 -6 (C4 )). The Siphnians are listed as one of the poleis providing ships for the Greek fleet at Salamis (Hdt. 8 . 42 . 1 , 46 . 4 , 48 , 49 . 1 ). The territorial sense may be a connotation at Isoc. 19 . 20 . In Siphnos was found a copy of the Athenian Coinage Decree ( IG xii . 5 480 = IG i³ 1453 E), to be set up in the agora of all the poleis of the Delian League (ll. 4 -5 ). Siphnos is called an asty at Hdt. 3 . 58 . 4 . The collective use of the city-ethnic appears internally in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ) and externally in inscriptions ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 20 ; I.Délos 98 A. 12 ( 377 / 6 ); Agora xvi 50 . 10 ( 365 -355 )) and in literary sources (Hdt. 3 . 57 . 2 , 8 . 46 ; Dem. 13 . 34 ). For the individual and external use, see IG xii . 5 611 . 2 = CEG i 410 (C6l); IG i³ 1032 . 163 ( 405 ). Patris is found in Isoc. 19 . 7 and 23 . Strabo, quoting Artemidoros, lists Siphnos among the Kyklades ( 10 . 5 . 3 ; cf. Steph. Byz. 454 . 6 ). The Siphnian countryside is littered with towers (N. G. Ashton ( 1991 )); the famous mines,which began to be exploited in C6 , have been well studied (Wagner and Weisgerber ( 1985 )). The Siphnians distributed the income from these mines each year among themselves (Hdt. 3 . 57 . 2 ). Late sources report settlements called Απολλωνία (Steph. Byz. 106 . 11 ) and ΜινΩsubiotaώα (Steph.Byz. 454 . 6 ), both undated and unlocated.We do not know the name of the large settlement at Ag.Andreas occupied from the Geometric through the Heltic period; it is possible that this settlement rivalled the main one at modern Kastro for a while before Siphnos was consolidated as a single polis (Philippaki ( 1973 ); cf. Reger ( 1997 ) 459 -60 ). Siphnos was allegedly colonised by Ionians from Athens (Hdt. 8 . 48 ). Herodotos extols Siphnian wealth in C6l, famous enough to tempt Samians who needed money in their fight against Polykrates; after destroying the Siphnians' countryside,defeating them in battle,and besieging the asty , the Samians exacted 100 tal. (Hdt. 3 . 57 -58 ). In 490 the Siphnians refused the Persian demand to surrender (Hdt. 8 . 46 . 4 ). Siphnos fought on the Greek side in the Persian War, contributing one ship (Hdt. 8 . 46 . 4 , 48 ) and is recorded on the Serpent Column in Delphi (ML 27 . 10 ). Siphnos was a member of the Delian League and probably among the original members ( ATL iii. 198 ). It belonged to the Island district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 20 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 26 ) a total of eleven times, four times completely restored, paying a phoros of 3 tal. in all years ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 20 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 66 ) for 9 tal. Siphnos joined the Second Athenian Naval League in the 370 s ( IG ii² 43 .B. 30 ), and in 370 / 69 the Siphnians dedicated a crown to Athena in Athens ( IG ii² 1425 . 125 ). A treaty between the Siphnians and the Athenians (no. 361 ) regulated capital crimes, among other matters ( Agora xvi 50 ( c. 360 -350 )). T o the same period belongs a treaty between Siphnos and Kalaureia (no. 360 ) ( IG iv 839 ). During the initial phases of Alexander's war against the Persian Empire, Datames held the island, which was used as a forward naval base (Arr. Anab . 2 . 2 . 4 , 13 . 4 ). In C5 the Siphnian constitution was democratic; but in, probably, 405 / 4 an oligarchic (Isoc. 19 . 13 , 38 ) government was set up supported by a Lakedaimonian(?) garrison. The oligarchs were in turn expelled by the democratic exiles, probably in 394 / 3 (Isoc. 19 . 19 -20 ). Supported by some mercenaries, the oligarchic exiles ventured an attack on the island, but they were defeated in a battle fought outside the town (Isoc. 19 . 38 -39 ), and the constitution was still democratic in C4m ( Agora xvi 50 . 9 -10 = SEG 17 19 ( 365 -355 )). For the reconstruction of this stasis , see Blass ( 1892 ) ii 235-36 ; Gehrke, Stasis 151 ). Our only source for Siphnian political institutions in the Classical period is Isokrates' Aiginetan speech in which we hear of Siphnian nomoi on adoption and inheritance ( 13 , 15 ), a system of liturgies incumbent on the wealthy ( 36 ), and the office of basileus ( 36 ). An embassy to Siphnos, sent by Samian exiles in the 520 s, is mentioned at Hdt. 3 . 58 . 1 . The existence of a prytaneion ( infra ) implies prytaneis . Communal cults include one for the Nymphs ( IG xii . 5 483 ), who had a cult site. The Siphnians consulted the oracle at Delphi c. 520 (Hdt. 3 . 57 . 3 -58 . 1 ; Paus. 10 . 11 . 2 ; Suda Σ 511 ; Fontenrose ( 1978 ) 307 Q 115 ) and built the famous Siphnian Treasury with a tenth of the income from their mines (Hdt. 3 . 57 . 2 ; Daux and Hansen ( 1987 ); Jacquemin ( 1999 ) 352 no. 441 ; Neer ( 2001 ). The polis site was on the east coast of the island and was presumably walled by c. 500 (Brock and Macworth Young ( 1949 ) 2 ). By c. 525 the Siphnians had a prytaneion built of Parian marble (Hdt. 3 . 57 . 4 ) and an agora (Hdt. 3 . 57 . 4 ) where probably the Athenian Coinage Decree was set up ( supra ). The Siphnians struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard starting in C6 . ( 1 ) Staters and hemidrachms,C6 . Types: obv . eagle flying; rev . incuse square. ( 2 ) Silver staters and fractions on the Aiginetan standard, some drachms on the Attic standard, C5 . Types: obv . head of Apollo; rev . eagle flying in incuse square accompanied by barley; legend: ΣΙΦ reversed and with three-bar sigma . ( 3 ) In C4 the Siphnians coined in both silver and bronze. Types: obv . Apollo (silver); Artemis (bronze); rev . eagle flying with serpent in beak; legend: ΣΙΦ (Head, HN ² 491 ; Erxleben ( 1970 ) 73 -74 ; SNG Cop. Aegean Islands 744 -50 )."
520,Skiathos (Skiathios),The Aegean,39.1,23.27,746,3710,"520 . Skiathos (Skiathios) Map 55 . Lat. 39 . 10 , long. 23 . 27 . Size of territory: 2 ( 50 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Σκίαθος , ηasper (Simonides fr. 1 ; Hdt. 7 . 179 ; IG ii² 1623 Aa 35 ( 333 / 2 )). The city-ethnic is Σκιάθιος ( IG i³ 266 . ii : 5 ; CID i 13 . 1 (C4f); Theopomp.fr. 375 ). In the so-called Charter of the Second Athenian Naval League, Skiathos is listed under the heading polis ( IG ii² 43 .A. 78 , 86 ). For polis used in the urban sense, see Ps.-Skylax 58 , where Skiathos is described as δίπολις καιgrave λι µ ήν (cf. Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 156 -57 ). One of these towns was the Palaiskiathos whose citizen Οινιάδης οasper Παλαισκιάθιος was honoured by the Athenians in 408 / 7 ( IG i³ 109 ). That the territory of this town and the island were coterminous may be inferred from the language of the Athenian decree, which praises him for treating well Athenians who arrived 'into Skiathos' ( IG i³ 110 . 7 -8 , 10 -12 ). But there was clearly confusion in Athens between Skiathians and Palaiskiathians, because the decree includes an amendment to the effect that Oiniades be named Παλαισκιάθιος instead of Σκιάθιος ( IG i³ 110 26 -31 ). The collective use of the ethnic is attested internally on coins of C4s ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 266 . ii 5 ). For the individual and external use, see the Athenian C5l proxeny decree ( IG i³ 110 . 29 ). Skiathos is listed among the Kyklades by Ps.-Skylax 58 and Diod. 15 . 30 . 5 , whereas the island is described in Strabo 9 . 5 . 16 as one of the islands off Magnesia. According to Ps.Skymnos 580 and 586 , Skiathos was colonised by the Chalkidians from Euboia. In 480 the Greeks stationed three ships by Skiathos to watch over the Persian fleet; signal fires lit on the island communicated information back to the Greeks at Artemision (Hdt. 7 . 179 -83 ). The Skiathians were members of the Delian League.They belonged to the Thracian district ( IG i³ 269 . ii . 30 ) and are recorded in the tribute lists from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 40 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . iii . 14 ) a total of fourteen times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 5 ). By 408 / 7 there was an Athenian archon on Skiathos charged in the Athenian decree mentioned above with seeing to it that the Palaiskiathians not be mistreated ( IG i² 110 . 19 -20 ). Under Spartan hegemony from the end of the Peloponnesian War until Chabrias' expedition in the Aegean in 377 / 6 (Diod. 15 . 30 . 5 ), the Skiathians joined the Second Athenian Naval League in the 370 s ( IG ii² 43 .A. 86 ). In 351 Demosthenes praised Skiathos and other nearby islands for the logistical support they offered the Athenian fleet ( 4 . 32 ); in 345 / 4 an Athenian garrison stationed on Skiathos offered the Athenian demos a crown ( IG ii² 1443 . ii . 106 -8 ; Dreher ( 1995 ) 291 n. 55 ), and ships were sent to Skiathos commanded by a strategos ( IG ii² 1623 . 35 -49 ). Inscriptions from Delphi include a treaty between the Delphians (no. 177 ) and Skiathians about consultation of the oracle ( CID i 13 = Staatsverträge 295 ). The treaty opens with a reference to the Skiathian demos and colonists ( apoikoi ). The town of Skiathos was probably located at modern Skiathos town (cf.Fredrich ( 1906 b ) 103 ; see also Reger ( 1997 ) 483 n. 25 ). There are no remains of any other settlement on the island. A Samian funerary inscription of C5 has been found on Skiathos (Johnston ( 1998 )). The Skiathians seem to have begun to strike bronze coins in C4m. Types: obv . head of Apollo or Hermes, or Gorgon head facing; rev . caduceus; legend: ΣΚΙΑΘΙ or ΣΚ (Head, HN ² 313 ; SNG Cop.Thessaly 366 -67 )."
521,Skyros (Skyrios),The Aegean,38.55,24.35,849,4121,"521 . Skyros (Skyrios) Map 55 . Lat. 38 . 55 , long. 24 . 35 . Size of territory 4 ( 223 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Σκυtildeρος , ηasper (Soph. Phil . 240 ; IG xii . 8 668 . 5 (C4 )), denoting both the island and the town (Ps.-Skylax 58 ). The city-ethnic is Σκυacuteριος (Hdt. 7 . 183 . 3 ; Stephanis ( 1988 ) no. 1797 (C4 )). Skyros is called a polis both in the urban sense (Ps.Skylax 58 ) and in the political sense (Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 31 ). Two lost tragedies both entitled Σκυacuteριοι testify to the collective and external use of the city-ethnic (Soph. frr. 507 -10 and Eur. frr. 683 -86 , Nauck), which is also known from inscriptions ( IG i³ 285 . iv . 107 -10 ). The individual and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in Hdt. 7 . 183 . 3 ; the internal in an undated sepulchral inscription ( IG xii . 8 676 ). Skyros was originally inhabited by Pelasgians ( IG xii . 8 p. 175 ). The island was seized by the Athenians under Kimon (Diod. 11 . 60 . 2 ; Ephor. fr. 191 ; Plut. Cim . 8 . 3 -7 ) in, probably, 476 / 5 (Plut. Thes . 36 . 1 ). The inhabitants were subjected to andrapodismos , and Skyros was resettled with Athenians (Thuc. 1 . 98 . 2 ), apparently described as klerouchs by Ephor. fr. 191 = Diod. 11 . 60 . 2 : κατεκληρουacuteχησε , see also Graham ( 1983 ) 184 -85 ; Cargill ( 1995 ) 6 ). By contrast with the Lemnians and Imbrians, the Skyrians are never mentioned as members of the Delian League, and so, probably, remained Athenian citizens. For the view that Skyros may have been a colony, see Figueira ( 1991 ) 217 , 221 ; Salomon ( 1997 ) 68 takes no position on Skyros. Athens had to surrender Skyros in the Peace of 404 (Andoc. 3 . 12 ; Aeschin. 2 . 76 -77 ), but by 392 , after a short period of independence (Andoc. 3 . 12 , 14 ), the Athenians had regained control of the island (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 15 ), and Athenian possession was confirmed by the King's Peace of 386 (Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 31 ). The grain law of 374 / 3 shows that Skyros was still an Athenian possession ( Hesperia suppl. 29 5 . 6 -8 ), in spite of the decision of 378 / 7 to renounce the klerouchies (Diod. 15 . 29 . 8 ). Philip II must have recognised Skyros as an Athenian possession in 338 (Paus. 1 . 25 . 3 ), for Skyros was still Athenian in the 320 s (Arist. Ath . Pol . 62 . 2 ), and remained Athenian by the Peace of 322 (Diod. 18 . 18 . 4 ; see Cargill ( 1995 ) 42 -58 ). The only preserved C4 decree passed by the Skyrian klerouchs ( IG xii . 8 668 ) indicates that the C4 population of Skyros was divided into Athenians and inhabitants (ll. 4 -5 : τοgraveν δηtilde [ µ ον τοgraveν Αθηναίων ] καιgrave τουgraveς κατοικουtildeντας εν Σκυacuteρωι with καιgrave to be restored in l. 2 ), who seem to have had the same status as Athenian metics (Dem. 52 . 3 , 9 ). Such civic subdivisions as are attested belong to the Athenians ( IG xii . 8 669 ; Cargill ( 1995 ) 389 no. 1124 ; Jones, POAG 188 ). The only important river was called the Kephissos, an obvious echo of Attika (Strabo 9 . 3 . 16 ). Considerable remains of the main city fortification walls are preserved; they have been dated,exclusively on style, to C4s; the walls enclosed an area of 4 . 5 ha, including a separately fortified acropolis of 0 . 5 ha (Fredrich ( 1906 c ) 262 -71 ). The reference at Diod. 11 . 60 . 2 to a siege of Skyros indicates that the city was fortified in C5e. Remains of a small temple have been reported (Fredrich ( 1906 c ) 275 -76 ). A C4 horos inscription has been found (Finley ( 1985 ) no. 111 : πραtildeσις επιgrave λυacuteσει ). Plutarch notes a settlement named Κρήσιον ( Cim . 8 . 3 ), which has been identified with extensive ruins on the south-west coast (Fredrich ( 1906 c ) 274 ). A scholiast to Diodorus repeats this name and adds another: Smyros: έχουσα Αχίλλειον καιgrave Κρήσιον (schol. Diod. T 326 ). Achilleion has been taken as the name of the main anchorage on the north-east side of the island, south of the main settlement, and not as a settlement, because of the absence of ancient remains there (Fredrich ( 1906 c ) 273 -74 ). Nocoins appear to be known (Erxleben ( 1970 ) 120 )."
522,Syme (Symaios),The Aegean,36.35,27.5,538,2347,"522 . Syme (Symaios) Map 61 . Lat. 36 . 35 , long. 27 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 ( 58 km ² ). Type: [A]. The toponym is Συacute µ η , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 671 ; Hdt. 1 . 174 . 3 ; Thuc. 8 . 41 . 4 ; IG i³ 278 . vi . 28 ), in the Doric dialect Συacute µ α ( IG xii . 3 suppl. 1269 . 7 (C2 )), denoting both the island and the town (Steph. Byz. 591 . 17 -18 ). The city-ethnic is Συ µ αῖος ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 45 ). In the Athenian tribute lists Syme is recorded under the heading πόλες h αgraveς h οι ιδι ˜ οται ενέγραφσαν φόρον φέρεν ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 18 -21 , 28 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is found in the tribute lists ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 45 ). According to Diodorus ( 5 . 53 . 1 -4 ), Syme was settled by Lakedaimonians and Argives, later joined by Knidians and Rhodians. Syme was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 148 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists either by toponym ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 28 ) or bycity-ethnic ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 45 ) from 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 28 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 45 ) a total of five times, three times completely restored,paying a phoros of 1 , 800 dr.( IG i³ 278 . vi . 28 ). The first four payments are recorded among those by poleis that private persons had inscribed ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 18 -21 ); the fifth payment is assessed by the boule and the dikasterion ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 43 -44 ). Syme was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 148 ) for 3 , 000 dr. Two fragments of the Athenian Coinage Decree were found on Syme ( IG i³ 1453 A, D). In 412 / 11 the Peloponnesians defeated the Athenians in a naval battle fought off Syme (Thuc. 8 . 41 -43 ). The town in the north-eastern part of the island had a walled acropolis with a sanctuary of Athena.There are traces of two circuits in polygonal masonry with interval towers, probably of the Heltic period (Zschietzschmann ( 1931 ) 1098 ; Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1962 ) 168 -69 , ( 1970 ) 63 -64 ). The lower wall enclosed an area of c. 0 . 3 ha. The only inscription antedating the Heltic period seems to be a C4 tombstone set over a soldier killed in battle ( IG xii . 3 9 = CEG ii 694 ). Coins sometimes assigned to Syme (see Erxleben ( 1970 ) 93 ) can now be assigned rather to Syangela (no. 931 ) in Karia on the basis of new finds (Yarkin ( 1975 ), ( 1977 ))."
523,Syros (Syrios),The Aegean,37.26,24.56,875,4085,"523 . Syros (Syrios) Map 60 (inset). Lat. 37 . 26 , long. 24 . 56 . Size of territory: 3 ( 85 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Συtildeρος , ηasper ( SEG 19 204 A. 3 ( c. 375 ); I. Délos 104 -11 A 2 . 1 = IG ii² 1638 .A. 21 ( 359 / 8 ); Theopomp. fr. 111 ; Strabo 10 . 5 . 3 , 8 ; Steph. Byz. 230 . 1 ), denoting both the island (Strabo 10 . 5 . 3 ) and the town (Ps.-Skylax 58 ). The city-ethnic is Συacuteριος ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 31 ; Arist. Hist. an . 557 a 3 ). In Ps.-Skylax 58 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Syros is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε ; Syros is called a polis in the political sense at Theopomp. fr. 111 (rC4f according to Jacoby's commentary), and in the accounts of the Delian amphiktyones , where polis is used in the political sense, the Syrians are recorded under the heading αιasperacuteδε τῶν πόλεων ( I.Délos 97 . 13 (C4f)). The collective use of the city-ethnic appears internally on its Heltic coins (Head, HN ² 492 ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 31 ) and in the accounts of the Delian amphiktyones ( IG ii² 1635 . 1 -2 ( 377 -373 )). The individual and external use of the ethnic appears in Aristotle ( Hist. an . 557 a 3 ), referring to the C6 poet Pherekydes of Syros, and in Theopomp. fr. 111 . Strabo, citing Artemidoros, lists Syros among the Kyklades ( 10 . 5 . 3 ). Homeric Syrie ( Συρίη in Od . 15 . 403 ) is erroneously identified with Syros by both Zschietzschmann ( 1932 b ) 1790 and Meyer ( 1975 ). Syros was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Island district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 31 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 30 ) a total of twelve times, four times completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 500 dr. in 452 / 1 , reduced to 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 270 . v . 33 ) in or before 448 / 7 ( IG i³ 264 . ii . 17 ), but raised again to 1 , 500 dr. in or before 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . i . 80 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 80 ) ( 1 tal.). Syros may have joined the Second Athenian Naval League in the 370 s ( I.Délos 98 A. 11 -12 , B 3 = IG ii² 1635 A. 11 -12 , 113 ( 377 -375 ); SEG 19 204 ( 375 ); cf. Dreher ( 1995 ) 201 n . 22 ), but is not recorded among the members listed in IG ii² 43 . In the thirteenth book of his Philippika Theopompos reports that a Syrian citizen, Kallikon, betrayed Syros to the Samians (fr. 111 ). Jacoby ad loc . dates the incident to C4f. The C4m list of proxenoi of Karthaia (no. 492 ) included at least two from Syros ( IG xii . 5 542 . 46 ). The principal civic divisions were three tribes ( IG xii . 5 654 (undated), with Jones, POAG 211 ), the names of two of which are known: the Naxiatai ( IG xii . 5 652 (C2 ), with Gauthier ( 1996 ) 35 -43 ) and the Galessioi ( I.Délos 98 B. 18 (C4 )). Galessa, which must have been the centre of the tribe of the same name, was located on the western side of the island; this suggests that the Syrian tribes were territorially based. Delian Apollo owned some property on the island ( I.Délos 104 -11 A 21 ). The chief gods were very likely the Kabeiroi, although the inscription that supposedly attests to a sanctuary remains enigmatic ( IG xii . 5 673 with commentary there by Hiller von Gaertringen (undated); see also Nicolet-Pierre and Amandry ( 1992 ) 305 -6 n. 32 , for a late coin referring to this cult; Head, HN ² 492 ; Hemberg ( 1950 ) 182 -84 ). Archaeological material from the Geometric to Roman periods that might be associated with such a sanctuary has been reported (Manthos ( 1979 )). The ancient polis lies beneath the modern city of Ermoupolis and is therefore unexplored (Leekley and Noyes ( 1975 ) 51 ). Syrian drachmas ( Συacuteριαι δραχ µ αί ) are recorded in Delian accounts of C4m ( I.Délos 104 . 105 ( 364 / 3 )); in consequence, Head's date of c. 300 for the start of Syrian coinage is too late by at least 65 years (Head, HN ² 492 ). But the known coins attributed to the pre-Heltic period have now been shown to be modern forgeries (Nicolet-Pierre and Amandry ( 1992 ))."

The toponym is Τηtildeλος , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 153 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 99 ; IG i³ 71 . ii . 145 ). An alternative toponym is Αγαθουtildeσσα (Hsch. Α 280 ; Steph. Byz. 621 . 1 ; cf. Callim. fr. 581 ). The city-ethnic is Τήλιος ( IG i³ 284 . 12 ; RivFil 70 15 . 1 ( c. 300 )). T elos is not explicitly called a polis until C3f ( IG xii . 3 29 . 6 ), but an unpublished arbitration of c. 300 strongly suggests polis status in C4s ( infra ), and membership of the Delian League indicates polis status in C5s. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in the arbitration of c. 300 ( supra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( supra ). The external and individual use is attested in an epitaph from Mesambria Pontica ( SEG 47 1075 (C5 -C4 )). Ps.-Skylax 99 lists T elos in his chapter on Karia among the inhabited islands near Rhodos. According to Strabo, it belonged to the Sporades ( 10 . 5 . 14 ), whereas Steph. Byz. assigns it to the Kyklades ( 620 . 22 ). Telos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 145 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists by city-ethnic ( IG i³ 284 . 12 ), but in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 by toponym ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 145 ). It is recorded twice, in 427 / 6 or 426 / 5 ( IG i³ 284 . 12 ) and in 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 27 ) paying an unknown amount.Telos was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 145 ) ( 2 tal.) and in 410 / 9 ( IG i³ 100 . ii . 5 ( 1 tal.), but city-ethnic almost completely restored).

Robert ( 1969 -90 ) i. 569 -74 ; for absorption by Rhodos in C3 , see Papachristodoulou ( 1989 ) 46 -47 ). An unpublished Koan arbitration for Telos of c. 300 includes a civic oath in which the citizens swear to stand by the existing political organisation ( politeuma ), to preserve the damokratia , and not to oppose the damos ( RivFil 70 no. 15 ; cf. Rhodes, DGS 290 ). The cult of Athena Polias and Zeus Polieus is epigraphically attested in C3e ( IG xii . 3 40 . 9 ; cf. SEG 3 715 . 8 (second century ad )) and probably to be connected with the obverse types of the C4 coins ( infra ; Fiehn ( 1934 ) 430 ). A C4 dedication inscribed Ποτειδ [ αtilde ] νος testifies to a cult of Poseidon ( IG xii . 3 37 ). The town was situated in the northern part of the island and was apparently the only settlement.

525,Tenos (Tenios),The Aegean,37.3,25.1,2231,10833,"525 . Tenos (Tenios) Map 60 (inset). Lat. 37 . 30 ; long. 25 . 10 . Size of territory: 3 ( 195 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Τηtildeνος , ηasper (Hdt. 4 . 33 . 2 ), denoting the island (Aesch. Pers . 885 ), the town (Ps.-Skylax 58 ) and the political community (Eupolis fr. 245 , PCG ). According to Arist. fr. 612 , alternative toponyms were ' Υδρόεσσα and ' Οφιουtildeσσα . The cityethnic is Τήνιος ( IG ² ii 1635 A. 20 ( 377 / 6 -374 / 3 ); Thuc. 8 . 69 . 3 ). Steph. Byz. 622 . 4 -6 records Τηνευacuteς as a variant form, perhaps attested in a C4s inscription from Kyrene ( SEG 9 . 2 . 15 : Τ [ ηνέσ ] σι = Tod 196 ; cf. SEG 421663 and infra ). Tenos is implicitly called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.Skylax 58 (Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ), and the Tenians appear under the heading polis used in the political sense in the so-called Charter of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 . 32 , 70 , 78 , B 17 ) and in the accounts of the Delian amphiktyones ( I.Délos 98 Aa 12 , Ba 4 = IG ii² 1635 ( 377 / 6 -374 / 3 )); cf. also Hdt. 4 . 33 . 2 . After C4m the prepositional group εκΠόλεως denotes one of the phylai (Étienne ( 1990 ) 22 ), but the noun πόλις is still being used in its usual sense, denoting the political community ( IG xii . 5 798 . 6 (C3 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins of C4l ( infra ) and externally on the Serpent Column at Delphi (ML 27 . 7 ), in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i² 263 . iv . 19 ), on Delos ( I.Délos 98 A 12 ( 377 / 6 )) and in Thucydides ( 7 . 57 . 4 ). Several inscriptions of C4 give the external individual ethnic ( IG ii² 10446 ; IG xii . 5 542 . 45 ; I.Délos 98 A 20 ). Patris is found in IG ii² 466 b. 38 ( 307 / 6 ). Strabo, citing Artemidoros, places Tenos among the Kyklades (Strabo 10 . 5 . 3 ). T enos was settled by Ionians c. 1000 (Lauffer ( 1989 ) 655 ). The island seems to have fallen under the control of Eretria (no. 370 ) in C8 ; this control would have ended by c. 650 (Strabo 10 . 1 . 10 ). The Persians captured the island in 490 (as implied by Hdt. 6 . 96 -97 ; cf. Aesch. Pers . 885 ). T enians served in Xerxes' fleet at Salamis (Hdt. 8 . 66 . 2 ), but desertion to the Greek side by one commander earned the Tenians a place on the Serpent Column at Delphi (Hdt. 8 . 82 . 1 ; ML 27 . 7 ); they appear also in the dedication at Olympia (Paus. 5 . 23 . 2 ). Tenos was a member of the Delian League, and may have been among the original members ( ATL iii. 198 -99 ). It belonged to the Island district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 19 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 29 ) a total of twelve times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of first 3 tal. ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 19 ), reduced to 2 tal. ( IG i³ 271 . i . 89 ) in or before 443 / 2 ( IG i³ 269 . v . 15 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 73 ) of 10 tal. They were still paying members in 413 , and naval forces, probably with marines, participated in the Sicilian expedition (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 4 ). In 411 a contingent of soldiers from Tenos supported the Four Hundred in Athens (Thuc. 8 . 69 . 3 ), and from this Gehrke, Stasis 159 infers that Tenos must have been one of the poleis in which the constitution was changed from a democracy to an oligarchy after the oligarchic revolution in Athens (cf. Thuc. 8 . 64 . 1 ). The Tenians joined the Second Athenian Naval League in the 370 s ( IG ii² 43 B. 17 ); one, Bion, served as Tenian envoy to Athens (no. 361 ) in connection with League business c. 370 -340 ( IG ii² 279 with D.M.Lewis ( 1954 ) 50 ). Other Tenian envoys to Athens are mentioned in a later inscription in which Tenians residing in Attika were awarded isoteleia in C4s ( IG ii² 660 with Pe˘ cirka ( 1966 ) 93 -95 ). T enos was subjected in 362 to andrapodismos by Alexander of Pherai (Dem. 50 . 4 ). The relocation of the town in C4m ( infra ) and the reorganisation of the civic subdivisions were probably caused by the andrapodismos and carried out in connection with a repopulation of the island (Étienne ( 1984 ) 211 ). If Τ [. . .] σι at SEG 9 2 . 15 refers to Tenos, the Tenians received 20 , 000 medimnoi of grain from Kyrene (no. 1028 ) during the grain crisis of 330 -326 (see SEG 92 1663 ; Gasperini ( 1996 ) 103 improperly corrects the text to read Τ [ ηνίοις ]; Brun ( 1993 b ) 187 -88 rejects both restorations and prefers to leave the text unemended; but, given the multiple odd ethnics in this inscription,it would not be surprising if the Kyrenaians simply got it wrong). Pace Hiller von Gaertringen ( IG xii . 5 xxiii, 1516 ) and Gigon (no. 138 ), there is no evidence to support the view that the Aristotelian collection of politeiai included a constitution of the Tenians. The eponymous official was the archon ( IG xii . 5 872 . 1 ); the theory that the office lasted only six months rather than a year is to be rejected (Gauthier ( 1992 ) against Étienne ( 1990 ) 42 -45 ). Prytaneis are restored in an Athenian decree of C4m ( IG ii² 279 . 2 -3 ; cf. D. M. Lewis ( 1954 ) 50 ; Pe˘ cirka ( 1966 ) 53 -54 ). Astynomoi appear in the register of sales of land of C4e ( IG xii . 5 872 . 1 ). Citizens from Tenos were appointed proxenoi by Karthaia (no. 492 ) ( IG xii . 5 542 . 45 (C4m)) and by Chios (no. 840 ) ( PEP Chios 50 (C4 )). The Tenian citizens were subdivided into, presumably, ten territorial phylai . These tribes may have been created or reorganised as part of a large-scale civic reform of C4m in which the moving of the urban centre was an important element (Étienne ( 1990 ) 45 -47 ). The names of Tenian tribes are attested epigraphically, typically in the form of phyletics added to name and patronymic; all are known from the large register of sales of land of C4l ( IG xii . 5 872 ); after each one listed below, only additional references to earlier attestations are noted: Γυρα ( ιευacuteς ) ( 873 . 9 , 12 (C4s), 875 . 17 (C4s)); ∆ονα ( κευacuteς ) ( 873 . 9 (C4s)); ' Ελειθυ ( αιευacuteς ) ( 875 . 31 (C4s)); ' Εσχα ( τιώτης ) ( 873 . 3 (C4s), 875 . 15 (C4s)); ' Ηρακλείδης ( 876 . 4 (C4l?)); Θεστιευacuteς ( 875 . 9 , 16 (C4s)); Θρυήσιος ( 876 . 1 (C4l?)); ' Ιακινθευacuteς ( 875 . 30 (C4s)); Κλυ µ ενευacuteς ( 872 . 109 (C4l)); εκΠολεως ( 872 , 875 . 8 (C4s)). The name of an 'eleventh' tribe, Σησταιdieresisacuteς , seems to be a false reading (Étienne ( 1990 ) 46 ). The tribe called εκΠολεως refers to Tenians registered in the former polis site at Xombourgo (see supra ) and probably embraced the majority of the inhabitants of the new asty on the seashore (so Étienne ( 1990 ) 22 ). Inhabitants were registered in one of at least eleven tonoi , neighbourhoods, of the asty ( IG xii . 5 872 . 6 , 21 , 25 , 36 , 44 , 72 , 123 with Étienne ( 1990 ) 22 -23 ). As many as twenty-three toponyms are attested, mostly in the large register of sales of land ( IG xii . 5 872 ); their locations throughout the island have been debated (Étienne ( 1990 ) 24 -30 ; Psarras ( 1994 )). The Thryesioi were probably located in the central part of the island at modern Komi, persuasively identified with the Κώ µ η recorded in IG xii . 5 872 . 19 (Étienne ( 1990 ) 29 ). From the toponym it can be inferred that ancient Kome was a village. There is no evidence of any other nucleated settlement on Tenos. A different gentilician civic subdivision was into πάτραι . By contrast with the phylai , the patrai may be seen as an aristocratic holdover: the law of introduction, νό µ ος εισαγωγηtildeς , which very likely regulates induction into the patrai , insists on legitimacy through the male line and sets an age restriction of at least 50 years ( IG xii suppl. 303 with Étienne ( 1990 ) 40 -42 no. 2 ). A decree of the patra of the Androkleidai survives (Étienne ( 1990 ) 37 -39 no. 1 (C4e-C3s)). The huge register of sales of land ( IG xii . 5 872 ) and a few small related inscriptions ( 873 -79 ) provide us with valuable information about ownership of landed property, inheritance and size of families (often more than two adult children in a family); see the analysis in Étienne ( 1990 ) 51 -84 . The protective deities were Poseidon and Amphytrite, whose sanctuary lay on the sea 2 . 5 km west of the post-C4m urban centre (see infra ). There was probably a cult and a sanctuary of Demeter Thesmophoros from c. 700 (see infra ). Aninscription of C4m attests to a cult of Ge,possibly private only (Despinis ( 1979 ) 228 -29 ). The Tenian calendar is known most completely through IG xii . 5 872 . The names of nine months are given. Some are identical with the Athenian months, but apart from Tenos, Απελλειών ( 872 . 15 ) is attested only in Dorian and northwestern poleis (Étienne ( 1990 ) 47 -50 ; Trümpy, Monat . 60 -63 ). The urban centre of Tenos in the Archaic and most of the Classical periods was located at Xombourgo above the modern town (not in Barr .). This site was walled by C7 or later, and had a sanctuary in use from C8e which has been plausibly assigned to Demeter Thesmophoros (see Themelis ( 1976 ) 4 -23 for good overall plans and a summary of the excavations, which were never published as an ensemble; his interpretations, however, are to be rejected (Boardman ( 1978 ))). Some time around or after C4m, this centre was abandoned, and the urban centre of the polis was transferred to its present site by the sea. In Tenian sources, this new urban centre is usually referred to as the asty ( IG xii . 5 872 . 21 et passim ; I.Délos 104 -32 . 4 ( 320 s?); cf. Étienne ( 1984 ), ( 1990 ) 15 -24 ). The new asty was equipped with massive fortification walls dated to C4s (see the detailed description of Graindor ( 1910 ) 236 -42 , with corrections and commentary by Étienne ( 1990 ) 15 -18 ); the walls are mentioned in an inscription of C1 ( IG xii suppl. 315 with Étienne ( 1990 ) 139 ) and enclosed an area of c. 10 ha (Étienne ( 1990 ) 17 with plate II). The main sanctuary of the chief deities Poseidon and Amphytrite was located 2 . 5 km west of the new urban centre on the sea; started in C4mor after, the sanctuary and the asty form part of a coherent plan to reconfigure Tenian urban and sacred space (Étienne and Braun ( 1986 )). Philoch. fr. 175 claims that Poseidon was honoured there as a doctor. The Tenians began striking anepigraphic silver coins on the Aiginetan standard from c. 600 to c. 500 . Denominations: staters (rare), hemidrachms and triobols. Types: obv . bunch of grapes; rev . incuse square (Head, HN ² 492 -93 ; ArtemisGyselen ( 1977 )). Minting was resumed in C4l, and the oldest series of tetradrachms on the Attic standard is now dated to the period c. 315 -308 . Types: Obv . head of Herakles in lion's skin; rev . Zeus enthroned,holding eagle and sceptre; legend: ΤΗ (Head, HN ² 493 ; Étienne ( 1990 ) 225 -52 ; SNG Cop. Aegean Islands 766 -68 )."

The toponym is Θάσος , ηasper ( IG i 3 1144 . 43 , 130 ( 465 / 4 ); SEG 38 851 .B. 22 ( 407 ); Archil. fr. 228 . 1 ; Thuc. 8 . 64 . 2 ), denoting both the island (Arist. Hist . an . 549 b 16 ) and the town (Archestratos fr. 5 . 9 , Olson and Sens). The city-ethnic is Θάσιος ( IG xii . 8 264 . 11 = Koerner ( 1993 ) no. 71 (C4e); Thuc. 1 . 100 . 2 ). Thasos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Archil. fr. 49 . 7 ; Thuc. 8 . 64 . 3 , 4 , first occurrence; Dem. 35 . 35 ; Ps.-Skylax 67 ; Duchêne ( 1992 ) 125 no. 24 . 1 , 15 (C5m)) and in the political sense ( IG xii . 8 356 . 2 = CEG i 415 (C6l); IG xii suppl. 412 . 2 = CEG i 416 (C6l); SEG 42 785 passim (C5f); ML 83 passim (C5l); SEG 26 1029 . 5 (C4s); Hdt. 6 . 44 . 1 ; Thuc. 8 . 64 . 4 , second occurrence); the first occurrence at Thuc. 8 . 64 . 4 has the territorial sense as a connotation. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and amphora stamps (Garlan ( 1999 ) 17 -20 ) and in inscriptions ( IG xii suppl. 412 . 1 = CEG 416 (C6l); ML 83 . ii . 7 , before 407 (Graham and Smith ( 1989 )); IG xii . 8 264 . 11 (C4e)) and externally in both literary texts (Archil. fr. 20 ; Thuc. 1 . 100 . 2 ; Dem. 20 . 59 ) and inscriptions ( IG i³ 101 . 31 ( 410 / 9 ); IG xii . 4 109 (C5 ); Moretti ( 1953 ); SEG 43 486 . 33 (C4m)). The individual and external use is attested in inscriptions ( IG i³ 1373 -74 ( c. 407 ); IG iv² . 1 122 . 7 (C4m/C4s)) and in literary sources (Lys. 13 . 54 ; Dem. 20 . 61 ; Arist. Poet . i448 a 12 ). Patris is found in Dem. 20 . 59 . Ps.-Skylax 67 places Thasos in Thrace, and Strabo classes Thasos among the islands lying off Greece as far as Makedonia and Thrace ( 2 . 5 . 21 ). Though Herodotos mentions a Phoenician colony on Thasos ( 2 . 44 . 4 ; cf. also Paus. 5 . 25 . 12 ), the island was more famously colonised by the Parians (no. 509 ) under Telesikles in 710 -680 (Thuc. 4 . 104 . 4 ; Strabo 10 . 5 . 7 ; Steph. Byz. 306 . 14 ); for a foundation date of C7m,see Graham ( 2001 ) 228 -29 , 365 -402 . Archilochos has a good deal to say about the circumstances of the early colony (frr. 92 -112 ).An inscription of C5mentions as archegetes one Sotion (Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 335 no. 127 ; cf. Leschhorn ( 1984 ) 56 -60 and the useful summary in Pouilloux ( 1982 )); Hippoc. Epid . 1 case 5 mentions the archegetes . In C6l Thasos was controlled by the tyrant Symmachos, expelled by the Spartans (Plut. Mor . 859 D; Salviat ( 1979 ) 123 -25 ; Bowen ( 1992 ) 119 ). The Thasians were probably under an oligarchy in the earlier part of C5 (Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 43 ). They had an income from their mines on the island and the peraia ranging between 200 and 300 tal./year c. 500 (Hdt. 6 . 46 . 3 ). Histiaios attacked the island in 494 , but was repelled by the arrival of a Phoenician fleet (Hdt. 6 . 28 ). In 492 the Thasians surrendered to Mardonios and remained under Persian control until 479 (Hdt. 6 . 44 . 1 ). They joined the Delian League as contributors of ships, but revolted in 466 / 5 ; the Athenians besieged the island for three years before finally defeating the rebels. The Thasians were forced to pull down their walls, to surrender their fleet, to pay an indemnity, to pay phoros in the future and to cede their possessions on the mainland (Thuc. 1 . 100 -1 ; Plut. Kim . 14 . 1 -2 Polyaen. 2 . 33 , 8 . 67 ; IG i³ 1144 B. iii . 43 , 130 ; cf. Pébarthe ( 1999 )). Thasians appear thereafter serving in the Athenian fleet ( IG i³ 1032 . 431 ), and Athenians owned property on Thasos ( IG i³ 426 . 45 , 144 ). The Thasians became paying members of the Delian League. They belonged to the Thracian district ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 56 ) and are recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . v . 14 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 17 ) a total of fourteen times,once completely restored, paying a phoros of 3 tal. ( IG i³ 259 . v . 14 ), raised to 30 tal. in 446 / 5 ( IG i³ 266 . iii . 8 ) or the year before when the Thasians are recorded three times ( IG i³ 265 . i . 94 , 107 , ii . 66 , restored). The Thasians were assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 155 ) of 60 tal. In 411 , in the wake of the revolution of the Four Hundred, the Athenian strategos Dieitrephes abolished the democracy in Thasos (Thuc. 8 . 64 . 2 ) and established an oligarchy, called αριστοκρατία and ευνο µ ία by the Athenians in 411 ( 64 . 3 , 5 ) but ολιγαρχία by Thucydides ( 64 . 5 ) and by the Athenians in 407 in a contemporary inscription ( SEG 38 851 .A. 4 , 19 , B. 2 -3 , 20 ). But soon afterwards the anti-Athenian faction got the upper hand, and the Thasians defected from Athens with the help of a squadron commanded by Timolaos of Corinth ( Hell. Oxy . 10 . 4 -5 ; IG xii . 8 402 ). The polis brought back its old institutions, restored its fortification walls and fleet (Thuc. 8 . 64 . 3 -5 ), and accepted a Lakedaimonian harmost (Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 32 ). They punished Athenian supporters ( IG xii . 8263 ; ML 83 ; cf. Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 139 -42 no. 18 ; on the date of this inscription as C5l but not autumn 411 or spring 410 , see Graham and Smith ( 1989 )). In the following year a stasis among the Thasians resulted in a short-lived expulsion of the pro-Lakedaimonian faction (Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 32 ; Gehrke, Stasis 161 ). Thasos must have defected once again, for in 410 / 9 the Thasian colony Neapolis (no. 634 ) was besieged by Thasians and Peloponnesians, but resisted with Athenian support ( IG i³ 101 = ML 89 ; see Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 155 -60 ), and in the spring of 407 the Athenians under Thrasyboulos recovered the island after a siege and restored the democracy (Xen. Hell . 1 . 4 . 9 ; Diod. 13 . 72 . 1 ), called explicitly δη µ οκρατία in a contemporary inscription ( SEG 38 851 .A. 7 = Grandjean and Salviat ( 1988 )). The Parians facilitated a reconciliation between the Thasians and the Neapolitans probably soon after 407 ( IG xii . 5 109 as reinterpreted by Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 178 -92 ; Piccirilli ( 1973 ) 144 -49 no. 33 ; see also the bas-relief from Delphi: Moretti ( 1953 )). Thasos' mainland possessions were apparently recovered only gradually, in 410 -407 and the 390 s (Brunet ( 1997 )). With Spartan victory at the end of the war, a squadron under Eteonikos captured Thasos (Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 5 ). In Polyaenus the conquest is ascribed to Lysandros, and we are told that, after a battle, he tricked Athenian sympathisers who had taken refuge in the temple of Herakles to surrender, whereupon they were executed (Polyaen. Strat . 1 . 45 . 4 ; the story is questioned by Gehrke, Stasis 162 -63 ). Thasians who supported the democracy ( IG ii² 6 ) and had been exiled from Thasos for supporting Athens ( IG ii² 33 . 6 -7 with Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 203 , and Polyaen. Strat . 1 . 45 . 4 ) were honoured by the Athenians in C5l and C4e ( IG ii² 6 , 17 , 24 , 25 , 33 ; cf. SEG 15 83 -87 , with Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 203 ; Salviat ( 1979 ) 120 -25 and Karamoutzou-Teza ( 1987 )). The Spartans controlled Thasos from 404 , but, with the help of a pro-Athenian faction, the Athenians recovered the island for themselves in 389 / 8 (Dem. 20 . 59 ; IG ii² 17 ). A few years later the pro-Athenians were expelled and found refuge in Athens ( IG ii² 24 , 33 ; Dem. 20 . 61 ; cf. Osborne ( 1981 -83 ) ii. 48 -57 ). But in c. 375 the Thasians joined the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 .B. 4 : [ Θάσι ] οι ). Philip II gained control of Thasos in (probably) 340 / 39 with the help of Thasian supporters (Dem. 18 . 197 ). The Thasians belonged to the League of Corinth in 338 ( IG ii² 236 .b. 5 = Staatsverträge 403 ). Thasian presbeis in Athens (no. 361 ) are attested in C4e ( IG ii² 24 .b. 16 ), and in the same period Thasians are honoured with Athenian citizenship ( IG ii² 17 ). The Thasians granted proxenia to a citizen from an unknown polis ( IG xii suppl. 352 (C4l)) and to a citizen from Olynthos (no. 588 ) ( Ét. Thas . 5 p. 223 no. 376 (C4l/C3e)), and Thasians were granted proxenia by Athens ( IG ii² 6 (C5l/C4e), with Walbank ( 1978 ) 324 -28 no. 61 (doubts about the identity of the family as Thasian) and Grandjean and Salviat ( 1988 )). Thasian theorodokoi are recorded as hosts of theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ) in 359 ( IG iv² . 1 94 . 31 ) and as hosts of theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) in c. 330 ( SEG 23 189 . ii . 20 ). The Thasians gave the Athenians a gold crown in 354 / 3 ( IG ii² 1437 . 10 -11 , 1438 . 15 -16 ). Many public enactments are known from Thasos. There are several wine laws. The earliest dates from c. 460 ( SEG 36 790 = Koerner ( 1993 ) no. 66 ); later parts belong to C5l and C4e ( IG xii suppl. 347 . i -ii = Koerner ( 1993 ) nos. 68 -69 ; cf. SEG 36 791 and Salviat ( 1986 )). A law regulating the cleanliness of the streets was passed in the 480 -460 s ( SEG 42 785 = Duchêne ( 1992 ); cf. Graham ( 1998 ) with Gauthier in BE ( 1999 ) 428 ). A law on commerce of 425 -415 regulated exports and imposed fines ( SEG 36 792 = Koerner ( 1993 ) no. 67 ). The revolutionary government of 411 -408 established rewards for informers in the last years of the Peloponnesian War (ML 83 = Koerner ( 1993 ) no. 70 ). A decree of C5l/C4e set up funerary honours for those who died for the fatherland (Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 371 -80 no. 141 ). A law set out conditions for accepting foreigners into the civic body of Thasos soon after the end of the Peloponnesian War ( IG xii . 8 264 = Koerner ( 1993 ) no. 71 , pace Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 204 -13 ). A sacred law of C5m regulated a cult of Herakles ( IG xii suppl. 414 = Duchêne ( 1992 ) 124 -25 no. 23 ); another, dated (perhaps over-precisely?) to 430 -420 , deals with a cult instituted by an individual ( SEG 38 853 ). A law from C4l seems to give a complete list of the city's festivals ( SEG 17 415 ; Salviat ( 1958 b )). At least from C5l on, public enactments were passed by the boule and/or the demos . The only preserved attestation is a law about naturalisation passed in C5l by the boule , with a major amendment passed by the demos ( IG xii . 8 264 = Koerner ( 1993 ) no. 71 ). For a C4l example of a decision presumably made by ( boule and) demos , see IG xii suppl. 352 . 5 . Lists of theoroi beginning about C6m ( IG xii . 8 273 -330 , 283 , 285 ) refer to the government of the Three Hundred and Sixty ( IG xii . 8 276 . 5 -7 (rC6l)); this may be a boule , with a member for every day of the year (Salviat ( 1979 )). The wine law of C5f ( SEG 36 790 . 8 ), the denunciation law of C5l (ML 83 . 3 ) and a C5l decision about confiscation of property ( IG xii . 8 263 . 7 ) all mention a board of 'Three Hundred' , presumably a lawcourt (ML p. 264 ; Koerner ( 1993 ) 246 , 264 ). The usual Thasian eponymous official was the archon, who served with two colleagues (ML 83 . i . 6 ; SEG 38 851 .B. 22 -23 (both C5l)); many fragments of archon lists survive, starting in C6 (but inscribed in C4 ): Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 259 -75 nos. 28 -34 and Dunant and Pouilloux ( 1957 ) nos. 199 -220 with p. 104 ; Sherk ( 1990 ) 292 -94 ). But during the period of Athenian domination from 463 , only a single archon served (Salviat ( 1984 ) 243 -46 ). In 397 the Spartan Lichas occupied the office (Salviat ( 1983 )). The theoroi appear also occasionally as eponymous officials ( IG xii . 8 263 .a. 1 ( 412 / 11 )). The archons forming a board of unknown number attested by c. 480 -460 are not to be confused with the eponymous officials ( SEG 42 785 . 27 ; Duchêne ( 1992 ) 64 -68 ). Inscriptions provide evidence of a raft of public officials, including polemarchoi (Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 371 -80 no. 141 ( c. 400 )), theoroi ( IG xii . 8 263 (C5l)), prostatai ( IG xii . 8 264 . 13 = Koerner ( 1993 ) no. 71 , with Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 204 -13 ), a grammateus , once called 'of the boule ' ( IG xii . 8 264 . 13 = Koerner ( 1993 ) no. 71 with Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 204 -13 , 371 -80 no. 141 ( c. 400 )), agoranomoi and gynaikonomoi (Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 371 -80 no. 141 ( c. 400 ); Salviat ( 1958 a ) 319 -23 no. 1 (C4 )), and epistatai ( SEG 42785 . 29 -30 ; Duchêne ( 1992 ) 68 -71 ). Apologoi are known from dedications (Bernard and Salviat ( 1962 ) no. 10 =Duchˆ ene (1992) 124 no. 23 ; Salviat ( 1957 )). Karpologoi appear in the famous law on commerce ( SEG 36 792 . 2 , 9 with Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 121 -34 , date: 425 -415 ). Inscriptions of C5l-C4e attest to groups designated by plural patronymic names: e.g. Φαστάδαι (Rolley ( 1965 ) 441 -42 no. 1 ). They are usually identified with the πάτραι known from C3 grants of citizenship ( IG xii suppl. 355 . 4 ) and are interpreted by Jones, POAG 184 -86 as civic subdivisions of an 'essentially private nature' . He argues too that one of the groups, the Γελέοντες (Rolley ( 1965 ) 449 no. 8 ), was in fact not a patra but a larger subdivision, possibly a phyle , contra Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 221 . Many communal cults and sanctuaries are attested for Thasos (brief surveys in Schachter ( 1992 ) 22 -25 ; Cole ( 1995 ) 309 -12 ). From the earliest written records we can see that Thasos was not identified with a single primary divinity, but with a constellation of divinities who catered to the needs of the community. Four of these divinities-Artemis (Hekate), Herakles, Apollo (Pythios) and Athena (Poliouchos)-seem to have been more prominent than others. Thasos therefore had not one major sanctuary, but four. Apollo Pythios and Athena Poliochos were located on the double summit, and Artemis and Herakles in the lower area (Cole ( 1995 ) 310 ). ( 1 ) Artemis, whose Artemision (Hippoc. Epid . 3 . 17 α ) was begun in C6s (Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 89 -91 ), was sometimes known by various epithets, including Hekate ( SEG 42 785 . 49 (C5f)). ( 2 ) Herakles sometimes bore the epithet Thasios ( IG xii suppl. 414 ); he is attested in C6l as one of the protective divinities of Thasos ( IG xii . 8 264 . 16 , 351 . 3 ); his cult was supposed to have been founded by the Phoenicians, and his temple existed by 480 -460 (Hdt. 2 . 44 . 4 ; Hippoc. Epid . 3 . 17 γ ; Polyaen. Strat . 1 . 45 . 4 ; Paus. 5 . 25 . 12 -13 ; SEG 42 785 . 2 , 23 -24 (C5f); IG xii suppl. 412 = CEG i 416 (C6 ); IG xii suppl. 350 (C5 ); cf. Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 142 -45 ; Launey ( 1944 )). ( 3 ) Apollo Pythios ( SEG 36 790 . 6 (C5f) (restored); SEG 42 785 . 9 ) was worshipped in the Pythion, which is attested epigraphically in C4 ( IG xii suppl. 350 (C4 )) and has produced sherds of 525 -500 (Grandjean and Salviat ( 1995 ); cf. also SEG 45 1205 ; Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 111 -12 ). ( 4 ) Athena is attested as Poliochos from C5f ( SEG 36 790 . 6 ); her sanctuary dominated the acropolis (Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 114 -16 ). Finally, Dionysos is attested alongside Herakles as a protective divinity of Thasos ( IG xii . 8 356 (C6l), 262 . 16 ; IG xii suppl. 398 (C4 )); the earliest archaeological remains of his sanctuary are C4 (Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 92 -94 ), but it is attested by Hippokrates by C5s (Hippoc. Epid . 1 . 21 ) public enactments were sometimes inscribed there (IG xii . 8 262 . 16 -17 ), and dramatic festivals connected with Dionysos are attested in inscriptions ( SEG 38 851 .A. 17 (C5l); IG xii suppl. 354 .a. 21 -22 ( c. 300 )). Other gods worshipped by the Thasians included Hera, who had a sanctuary by C5e, though it has not yet been located (Hippoc. Epid . 1 . 14 ). Zeus is attested with various epithets, as Zeus Katharsios (Pouilloux ( 1954 ) no. 101 with LSCG suppl. p. 124 (C4 )) and Zeus Agoraios, who had a sanctuary dating from C4e ( BCH 74 ( 1950 ) 333 -41 ; Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 230 -31 with IG xii . 8 361 ; Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 76 ). Zeus also served, under three different epithets, as patron deity of three of the Thasian patrai : Zeus Alastos, Zeus Ktesios and Zeus Patroios, along with Athena Mykesis and Athena Patroia ( IG xii suppl. 407 ( c. 400 ); Rolley ( 1965 ); Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 102 -5 ). Poseidon had a sanctuary dating from C5e/C4s ( IG xii suppl. 432 (C4 ); Bon and Seyrig ( 1929 ); Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 97 -98 ). Demeter Thesmophoros had her sanctuary the Thesmophorion (Paus. 10 . 28 . 3 (rC7 ); Rolley ( 1965 ); Müller ( 1996 ); Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 102 -5 ). Pan had a sanctuary ( IG xii suppl. 429 ; Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 117 -19 ). The Charites' sanctuary was in place by 480 -460 ( SEG 42 785 . 41 ; Duchêne ( 1992 ) 75 -77 , 93 -94 ; Berranger ( 1992 ) 184 -203 ). An Asklepieion is also attested (Salviat ( 1958 c )). Hippokrates mentions a temple of Ge ( Epid . 3 . 1 a). Among the cults of heroes may be mentioned the Mnema of Glaukos,which was located in the corner of the agora; the inscription which identifies it dates to c. 600 (Pouilloux ( 1955 ); Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 69 -70 ; cf. also Jeffery ( 1990 ) 300 -1 ). Infamously, the Thasians wanted to establish a cult for Agesilaos in 394 , though he refused (Plut. Mor . 210 C-D). The Thasians are known as a community to have consulted Apollo at Delphi twice in C5 (Paus. 6 . 11 . 7 -9 ). They made a communal dedication of a statue of Herakles at Olympia after their liberation from the Persians in 479 / 8 (Paus. 5 . 25 . 12 -13 ). Thanks to Pausanias ( 6 . 11 . 2 -9 ), we know a good deal about the athlete-hero Theogenes, whose cult had begun by the start of C4 . His victories included two in the Olympic Games (in 480 and 476 : Olympionikai 201 and 215 ), ten in the Isthmian, nine in the Nemean, and three in the Pythian (Pouilloux ( 1994 ) with the other sources; on the date of SEG 18 359 as 346 , see Holzman ( 1994 ) 152 ; Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 73 -76 ); statues of him were erected at Delphi ( Syll . ³ 36 A; Jacquemin ( 1999 ) 354 no. 459 ) and Olympia ( Syll . ³ 36 B). The Thasian calendar was of the Ionian type and was virtually identical with that of Paros (Salviat ( 1992 ) 263 ; Trümpy, Monat . 65 -72 ). The city itself, at the north-east corner of the island, was oriented towards the sea and exploited the natural landscape,rising gradually on a series of terraces to a striking and steep acropolis. There were two major centres. The lower city developed around the agora and harbour. To the south, the upper city was organised around the acropolis. The major sanctuaries determined the pattern of settlement and the orientation of major streets. There were two primary areas of habitation: one near the Artemision, the other near the Herakleion (Grandjean ( 1988 ) i. 312 -23 , 336 -46 ). In C6l the city was surrounded by a defence circuit (Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 94 -139 ) with gates named after specific divinities ( IG xii . 8 356 ; Picard ( 1962 )). The walls enclosed an area of almost 70 ha. Following the attack of Histiaios in 494 , the Thasians used their great wealth to strengthen their existing fortification walls (Hdt. 6 . 46 . 2 ). In 491 Dareios ordered these walls to be torn down and the Thasian fleet conveyed to Abdera (Hdt. 6 . 46 . 1 ). These walls must have been rebuilt (or perhaps the order was never fully carried out), for the Thasian urban centre was fortified in 463 , when the Athenians ordered the walls to be torn down again after the Thasian Revolt (Thuc. 1 . 101 . 3 ). In 411 the Thasians rebuilt their walls (Thuc. 8 . 64 . 3 ). These walls are mentioned in an inscription of C4l-C3e ( Ét. Thas . 5 223 no. 376 = Maier ( 1959 -61 ) no. 55 ), and ruins of them, with gates and towers, are still to be seen in the city (Grandjean and Salviat ( 1999 ), ( 1995 ), ( 1990 ), ( 1993 )). Thasian public architecture included a prytaneion , attested as early as C5f ( SEG 42 785 . 43 -44 ) and frequently thereafter ( IG xii . 8262 . 1 (C5l); restored, see SEG 38 851 ); Theophr. De Odoribus 51 ; cf. S. G. Miller ( 1978 ) no. 439 ; Duchêne ( 1992 ) 98 -99 ). The theatre claimed by Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 105 after Hippoc. Epid . 1 . 20 seems to be a misreading; Arist. Poet . 1448 a 12 attests to a Thasian actor, but this does not prove that a pre-Heltic theatre existed on Thasos; the earliest evidence seems to be I.Lampsakos 1 . 21 ( c. 300 ), IG xii suppl. 354 .a. 21 -2 ( c. 300 ) and the Heltic archaeological remains ( TGR ii. 303 -4 ). By C5f Thasos had an agora (Grandjean ( 1988 ) 480 -85 ; Duchêne ( 1992 ) 101 -4 ; Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 62 -64 ; for an 'agora of liars' , see Hippoc. Epid . 3 cases 8 and 12 ). From C4m the agora was flanked with stoas, and in the north-eastern corner was a building of C4l with offices for magistrates (Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 62 -71 ). Most extraordinary is the epigraphic attestation of a building called the αργυρα µ οιβήϊον in c. 480 -460 , where Thasian civic officials oversaw the exchange and circulation of money (Duchêne ( 1992 ) 19 -20 ll. 41 -42 , 79 -85 ). Next to it stood a συ µ πόσιον (Duchêne ( 1992 ) 19 -20 ll. 41 -42 , pp. 79 -85 ). Thasos had two harbours, one of which is described as κλειστός (Ps.-Skylax 67 ). The Thasians had military facilities for their ships by c. 500 (Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 52 -57 ). We know a fair amount about settlement patterns in the Thasian countryside,thanks in part to a remarkable inscription found at Aliki (see infra ) which gives directions and distances around the island (Salviat and Servais ( 1964 )). The inscription mentions two places. The first from the city ( polis ), Αίνυρα , was known already from Herodotos in connection with the Thasian mines ( 6 . 47 . 2 ) and must be a region rather than a village (Salviat and Servais ( 1964 ) 282 with n. 1 ; which is not to say that there might not also have been a settlement with the same name). The other is called τοgrave ∆ιάσιον τοgrave εν ∆η µ ητρίΩsubiotaω , which was a sanctuary of Zeus located at a place, probably a settlement, called Demetrion (ibid. 285 ); if this place has been rightly located, the village's god will have been Apollo Komaios (ibid. 287 ). Koinyra (Hdt. 6 . 47 . 2 ) was a village with mines nearby ( Barr . C). The modern village of Aliki lies at the site of an ancient settlement with a sanctuary that began in C7m, soon after the Parian colonisation of the island; Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 161 -68 ), and of important marble mines that began to be exploited in C6 ( Barr . AC). Remains of a Classical settlement have been found at modern Koukos,near the southern tip of the island ( Barr . C). The name Αιγγροκληtildeς may derive from the Thasian river Angros (Hdt. 4 . 49 . 2 with L. Robert ( 1938 ) 201 -2 ). The mines and quarries found in many places on the island were exploited from at least C6 (Muller ( 1979 ); des Courtils et al . ( 1982 ); Weisgerber and Wagner ( 1988 a ), ( 1988 b ); Sodini et al . ( 1980 )). The remains of many towers no doubt represent farmsteads (Bon ( 1930 ); Osborne ( 1986 )), but there is also a lighthouse ( pharos ) constructed in C6e in memory of Akeratos ( IG xii . 8 683 with Ko˘ zelj and Wurch-Ko˘ zelj ( 1989 )). Ateliers of amphoras continue to be found throughout the Thasian countryside (Garlan ( 1999 ) 2 -4 ). The Thasians struck silver coins on the so-called Thrako-Makedonian standard from C6l (perhaps first in 520 -510 ) up until C5l. It is hard to find much sign of the defeat of the Thasians by the Athenians on Thasian coinage (Duchêne ( 1992 ) 87 ). The coins have been sorted into three general groups on the basis of variations in details of the types, especially in the appearance of the maenad; the date of the groups is imprecise, but they fall roughly in order from C6l/C5e through C5 to perhaps 412 -404 for the third group.Types: obv . satyr/Silenos with a maenad (stater,trite), or satyr alone (hemihekte), or head of satyr (hekte), or two dolphins (quarter hekte), or dolphin (eighth hekte); rev . incuse square (all denominations). Anepigraphic till C5e, when legends appear: ΘΑΣΙ (hekte), ΘΑΣΙΩΝ (hemihekte), ΘΑ (quarter and eighth hekte). After an apparent pause in minting ( 404 -391 ), a new coinage on a new system (but the same standard) starts (probably) in 390 , with the return of democracy to Thasos, and runs to c. 335 ; some modifications were introduced c. 360 . The new coinage includes issues in gold and bronze along with silver. Denominations now include tetradrachms and drachms (replacing the old trite of the stater) in gold and silver; dichalkons, triobols, hemiobols and chalkous in bronze. Types: obv . Dionysos, bearded or juvenile (gold, silver), or head of Herakles (bronze); rev . Herakles as archer; legend: ΘΑΣΙΟΝ (gold, silver), or Silenos with kantharos or amphora (gold), or Herakles' symbols (bow, club, star); legend: ΘΑΣΙΟΝ (bronze; Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 216 -17 ; Picard ( 1982 ), ( 1987 ); Duchêne ( 1992 ) 85 -87 ; Grandjean and Salviat ( 2000 ) 303 -9 ; SNG Cop.Thrace 1007 -35 ). The Thasians are said to have colonised the Hedonian city of Myrkinos (no. 633 ), Galepsos (no. 631 ) and Oisyme (no. 635 ); cf. Thuc. 4 . 107 . 3 and 5 . 61 . 1 . An inscription attests to their colonisation of Neapolis (no. 634 ) ( IG i³ 101 . 7 = ML 89 . 7 : άποικοι όντες Θασίων ( 110 / 9 )) ( infra 863 ). For the Thasian peraia , see Hdt. 6 . 46 . 2 -3 , 7 . 109 . 2 ; Dem. 50 . 47 ; Diod. 11 . 68 . 4 , 16 . 3 . 7 . Thasian magistrates in the peraia are attested c. 400 ( IG xii suppl. 347 II = Salviat ( 1986 ) 147 -48 ; cf. Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 62 , 185 )."
527,Thera (Theraios),The Aegean,36.2,25.3,1854,8696,"527 . Thera (Theraios) Map 61 . Lat. 36 . 20 ; long. 25 . 30 . Size of territory: 2 ( 83 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Θήρα , ηasper (Pind. Pyth . 4 . 20 ; Arist. Pol . 1290 b 11 ; IG xii . 7 6 . 6 ; F.Delphes iii . 1 497 . 12 (C4l/C3e)), in the Ionic dialect Θήρη (Hdt. 4 . 147 . 4 ); the toponym denotes both the island and the town (Strabo 8 . 3 . 19 ). The city-ethnic is Θηραῖος (ML 5 . 6 (C4f); Pind. Pyth . 4 . 10 ). Thera is called a polis in the political sense (ML 5 . 37 (C7 ); Arist. Pol . 1290 b 11 -12 ); the territorial sense seems to be a connotation at Hdt. 4 . 150 . 2 . At Pind. Pyth . 4 . 20 Thera is called a matropolis . The collective use of the cityethnic is attested internally in a C4f version of what claims to be a Theraian decree of C7s (ML 5 . 25 ) and in abbreviated form on bronze coins of C4 ( infra ); it is attested externally in inscriptions ( IG i³ 71 . i . 68 ( 425 / 4 ); ML 5 . 2 (C4 )) and in literary sources (Hdt. 4 . 150 . 1 ). The individual and external use is found in Athenian C5 inscriptions ( IG i³ 30 . 5 (C5m), IG i³ 977 -80 (C5s)) and in literary sources (Hdt. 4 . 154 . 3 ). Thera was regarded as one of the Kyklades (Thuc. 2 . 9 . 4 ); for Strabo it is one of the islands near Crete ( 10 . 5 . 1 ). The names of a number of smaller settlements around Thera are known, and some of them have been located and explored archaeologically.Oia ( IG xii . 3 suppl. 1291 . 10 ) shows traces of settlement from the Archaic period to the end of Antiquity (see especially IG xii . 3 526 ), and Eleusis has produced evidence of settlement from the Classical period (Hiller von Gaertringen ( 1899 -1909 ) i. 299 -308 ). There may have been a settlement of Archaic and Classical date at modern Perissa (Sperling ( 1973 ) 30 -31 ). Thera was generally recognised to be a colony of Sparta (no. 345 ) under the oecist Theras (Hdt. 4 . 147 -49 ; Pind. Pyth . 4 . 251 -59 and 5 . 72 -76 ; Paus. 3 . 1 . 7 -8 , cf. IG xii . 3 382 (C4 ); Malkin ( 1994 ) 89 -111 ); in C4f Akesandros claimed that the oecist was called Samos and that a descendant called Aristoteles led the colony to Kyrene (no. 1028 ) (( FGrHist 469 ) fr. 5 a). The early and better version attributes the foundation of Kyrene,around 631 , to Battos (Hdt. 4 . 150 -58 ; Pind. Pyth . 4 . 4 -8 , 5 . 85 -95 ; ML 5 ; see Malkin ( 1987 ) 60 -69 ; on the oath in ML 5 , see now Dobias-Lalou ( 1994 ), who argues that the text was Theraian). In Herodotos'version,it was a severe and prolonged drought that drove the Therans to consult Apollo at Delphi and dispatch colonists. Menekles of Barka (C2 ) claims rather that stasis on Thera drove one of the factions off the island,but this may be a reflection of Heltic history making or of C4e problems on the island (( FGrHist 270 ) fr. 6 ; cf. Ager ( 2001 ) 107 ). The Therans at Kyrene maintained their identity separately from settlers from the Peloponnesos and Crete until C6 (Hdt. 4 . 161 . 3 ). Hostile to Athens in 431 (Thuc. 2 . 9 . 4 ), the Theraians are recorded as paying members of the Delian League from 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 54 , completely restored) or 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . iii . 23 , partially restored) to at least 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . i . 10 ) and possibly 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 10 , completely restored). Mattingly ( 1996 ) 77 argues that IG i³ 282 should be dated rather to 427 / 6 and that Thera was added to the Athenian sphere of authority at that date.Thera belonged to the Island district and was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 68 ) ( 5 tal.); cf. the decree of 426 / 5 ( IG i³ 68 ) in which Thera, paired with Samos, was denied the privilege of electing eklogeis to collect the tribute, perhaps as a punishment ( IV i³ 68 21 -24 ). Thera fell under Spartan hegemony after the Peloponnesian War and may have continued to be under that authority until Chabrias' expedition in the Aegean in 377 / 6 (Diod. 15 . 30 . 5 ). Part of the Theraian state, [ Θη ] ραίων [ οasper δηtilde ] µ ος ( IG ii² 43 .B. 1 -2 ), may have joined the Second Athenian Naval League in the early 370 s (Coleman and Bradeen ( 1967 ); but cf. Cargill ( 1981 ) 45 -47 : [-c. 2 -] ραίων [ οasper δ ] ηtilde µ ος ), which is restored in IG ii² as [ Κερκυ ] ραίων ; the expression here has recently been interpreted to reflect stasis on the island between oligarchic and democratic factions (Ager ( 2001 ); see infra ). The Kyrenaians (no. 1028 ) renewed in C4f the isopoliteia the Theraians had long enjoyed at Kyrene (ML 5 . 12 -13 (C4f)). The Theraians received grain from Kyrene during the crisis of c. 330 -326 ( SEG 9 2 . 17 ; cf. Marasco ( 1992 ) and Gasperini ( 1996 ) 106 n. 18 ). Asbefits a colony of Sparta (see supra ), the eponymous official on Thera was a board of three ephoroi ( IG xii . 3 336 (C3 but presumably to be interpreted retrospectively)). In the Archaic period Thera had a king (Hdt. 4 . 150 . 2 ). From Arist. Pol . 1290 b 11 -14 it can be inferred that, in an earlier period, Thera had been an oligarchy in which citizen rights were restricted to the descendants of the original colonists. The presumption is that Thera in C4s had become a democracy. It cannot be established when the constitution was changed from monarchy to oligarchy and from oligarchy to democracy. Recently stasis between oligarchic and democratic factions has been suggested for the 370 s; evidence includes the restoration of [ Θη ] ραίων [ οasper δ ] ηtilde µ ος at IG ii² 43 B. 1 -2 (see supra ), the appearance of an ekklesia in an inscription of C4 ( IG xii . 3 suppl. 1289 , infra ), and the unlikely assumption that, in the famous inscription from Kyrene (ML 5 ), the polis referred to in line 3 is Thera and not Kyrene itself; see on all this Ager ( 2001 ) 101 -13 , with other arguments; but it is better to be cautious here (Dreher ( 1995 ) 13 -14 n. 14 ). There is no basis for Gigon's view that the Aristotelian collection of politeiai included a Constitution of the Theraians (no. 62 ). Damiorgoi are known from inscriptions of c. 500 (?) and C4 ( IG xii . 3 450 . 2 -3 , 16 -17 ; Jeffery ( 1990 ) 323 for the date; IG xii . 3 suppl. 1289 (C4 )); the later inscription may also attest to an assembly ( εκκλησια ) functioning as a court in criminal actions ( IG xii . 3 suppl. 1289 ). Public enactments include a sacrificial regulation c. 500 (?) apparently regulating sacrifice to Athena ( IG xii . 3 450 with Jeffery ( 1990 ) 323 ), another of C4e ( IG xii . 3 452 ; LSCG no. 133 ; Gialelis ( 1997 ) 50 -51 (but cf. SEG 45 1104 )), and a law regulating sacrifice to the Mother of the Gods ( IG xii . 3 436 (C4 )). The Theraians may have had an agreement or treaty with the Athenians (no. 361 ) in C4f ( IG ii² 179 c with Ager ( 2001 ) 101 , 109 -10 ). A Theraian citizen received proxenia from Arkesine (no. 472 ) ( IG xii . 7 6 (C4 )). Theraian citizens were organised into phylai (Hdt. 4 . 148 . 1 ), obviously the three Dorian phylai all attested on the island: Hylleis ( IG xii . 3 378 (C4 )), Dymanes ( IG xii . 3 377 (C4 ), restored) and Pamphyloi ( IG xii . 3 626 (Roman), abbreviated). The seven choroi noted by Herodotos ( 4 . 153 ) should perhaps be associated with the toponyms of Eleusis, Melainai and Oia (so Jones, POAG 215 -16 ). The patron deities were Zens Polias and Athena Polias ( IG xii . 3 suppl. 1362 (C5 ?; for the date, see at IG xii . 3 427 with IG xii . 3 495 (first century ad ) IG xii . 3 427 may also refer to Zeus Polias). Other communal cults included those of Artemis(?) Soteira ( IG xii . 3 155 a (no date)) and Zeus Damatrios (?) ( IG xii . 3 418 with Kose ( 1997 ); SEG 45 1105 ). A wide variety of deities is mentioned in rock-cut inscriptions of Archaic and Classical date ( IG xii . 3 350 -83 , 399 -406 , suppl. 1312 -13 , 1316 -18 ). The Theraians consulted Apollo at Delphi in connection with the founding of a colony at Kyrene (Hdt. 4 . 155 . 3 ; ML 5 . 10 -11 , 24 -25 ; cf. Fontenrose ( 1978 ) 283 -85 Q 45 -9 , Q 51 ). As for the calendar, two months are attested in C4 , Artamitios and Hyakinthios ( IG xii . 3 452 = LSCG no. 133 ; IG xii . 3 436 ); the first is known in Kyrene too,the second shows Thera's connection with Lakedaimon (Trümpy, Monat . 186 ). We have no information on whether Thera was walled before the Heltic period (W. Dörpfeld argued in favour of an early fortification wall in Hiller von Gaertringen ( 1899 -1909 ) i. 190 -96 , but withdrew his interpretation of the evidence in iii. 160 -61 ; cf. Sperling ( 1973 ) 90 ); the ruins seen today date mostly from the massive Heltic rebuilding of the city in connection with its use as a major Ptolemaic base (Bagnall ( 1976 ) 123 -34 ).

The toponym is Αιανή , ηasper ( EAM 47 ; Steph. Byz. 37 . 7 ; later spelt ' Εανή ( EAM 15 )); possibly Aeane in Livy 43 . 21 . 5 (Megas ( 1976 )). The city-ethnic Αιαναῖος is given by Steph. Byz. 37 . 9 . Aiane is called a polis in the political sense in EAM 15 , which dates from the second century ad . The ethnic is attested only by Steph. Byz., but there is no reason to doubt its authenticity. Although Aiane, as the recent excavations at Megale Rachi have shown, was the capital of the kings of Elemia from Archaic times, it is not mentioned in the surviving historical works with the possible exception of Livy 43 . 21 . 5 in connection with the first military operations of the Third Makedonian War (Megas ( 1976 )). The three monumental buildings discovered on the top and on the slopes of the acropolis, one of which is certainly a portico belonging to an agora complex, as well as the urban planning of the residential area, show that Aiane had the external aspect of a polis from C6l, to which the oldest of these buildings belong (Karamitrou-Mentesidi ( 1993 ), ( 1994 ), ( 1996 a ) 16 -32 , ( 1996 b ) 25 -29 ). The power of the Elemiote kings, which in the C4e equalled that of the Temenids of Lower Makedonia, goes a long way to explain the early promotion of their residence to a full-blown city comparable to Aigeai. After the annexation of Upper Makedonia to the Temenid kingdom and its reorganisation by Philip II, Aiane remained the capital of Elemia, although from the administrative point of view not Aiane alone but the whole of Elemia with its other towns and villages constituted a political unit equal to the poleis of Lower Makedonia (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) ii. 89 -91 ). At Aiane probably were struck the bronze coins of King Derdas in the C4e. Types: obv . galloping horseman, or youthful Apollo, or youthful Herakles; rev . club and spearhead, or galloping horseman; legend: ∆ΕΡ∆Α , ∆ΕΡ∆ΑΙΟΝ (Liampi ( 1998 ))."
529,Aigeai (Aigaios),Makedonia,40.3,22.15,1166,5837,"529 . Aigeai (Aigaios) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 30 , long. 22 . 15 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Αιγεαί , αιasper ( IG iv 617 . 15 ) or Αιγέαι (Diod. 16 . 92 . 1 ) or Αιγαῖαι (Diyllos ( FGrHist 73 ) fr. 1 ) or Αιγαιαί (Diod. 19 . 52 . 5 ; I.Leukopetra 103 ) or Αιγαί (Diod. 16 . 3 . 5 ) or Αιγειαί (Theophr. fr. 5 . 27 ; Syll . ³ 269 L) or Αιγαία (Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 . 36 ). The city-ethnic is Αιγαῖος (Plut. Pyrrh . 26 . 11 ; IG xii . 8 206 . 12 (C1l)), later spelled ' Εγέος ( I.Leukopetra 73 ( ad 229 )). Aigeai is called a polis in the urban sense by Euphorion fr. 33 , van Groningen (rC7 ) and Plut. Pyrrh . 26 . 11 (r 274 ). A combined description of the urban and political aspects of the community is found in the phrase άστυ κτίζε πόληος (where asty is Aigeai and the polis is the Makedonian state), referring to the foundation of Aigeai in C7 and attested in a Delphic oracle of c. 500 (Diod. 7 . 16 ; for the date see Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) 464 -65 ). The epithet µ ηλοβότειρα shows that the toponym was used for the territory as well as for the urban centre (Steph. Byz. 39 . 1 ; cf. Just. 7 . 1 . 10 ). The political sense is implicit in the designation of Makedonians as belonging to the citizen body of Aigeai (cf. Syll . ³ 269 L and I.Magnesia 10 . 11 -12 : Αισχρίων Α µ [ υacute ] ντα Μακε [ δωgraveν εξ ] Αιγεῶν (C3 ); for the date, see Gauthier, Prakt ( 1984 ) 98 ). The earliest attestation of the individual use of the city-ethnic occurs in IG xii . 8 206 . 12 (C1l), but in Plut. Alex . 41 . 9 a C4Makedonian citizen is called Ευρυacuteλοχος Αιγαῖος . The territory of Aigeai bordered on that of Beroia to the west and Aloros to the east. The marshes of the mouth of the Haliakmon formed its northern limit,and the heights of the Pierians its southern one. Thus it extended over c. 12 . 5 km from the gorges of the Haliakmon to the river-bed of the Krasopoulis, and over c. 5 km of arable territory between the mountain and the marshes ( 62 . 5 km ² ). The territory of Aigeai comprised several minor settlements, of which only one has been identified: Blaganoi (Hatzopoulos ( 1987 a), ( 1990 ) 59 -60 ). Although situated on the right bank of the Haliakmon, Aigeai did not belong to Pieria, but, just like Aloros, to Bottia (Diod. 7 . 16 ) or Emathia (Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 . 36 ), as this region was called in later times (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) i. 239 -47 , ( 1996 a )). According to its foundation legend, Aigeai was originally a Phrygian (Brygian) city called Edessa,and the name Aigeai was first given to it by its Greek Makedonian conquerors (Euphorion fr. 33 , van Groningen; Just. 7 . 1 . 10 (rC7 )). From then on it was the Temenid capital, and it remained a part-time royal residence even after the transfer of the usual residence to Pella under King Amyntas III (Hatzopoulos ( 1987 b)); in particular, it retained its character of royal cemetery at least until the end of the Temenid dynasty. Citizens of Aigeai are known to have been proxenoi of several cities: Delphi (no. 177 ) ( Syll . ³ 269 L ( c. 300 or 272 )), Histiaia (no. 372 ) ( IG xii . 9 1187 . 30 ( c. 266 )) and Magnesia on the Maiandros (no. 852 ), where the recipient also received citizenship ( I.Magnesia 10 (C3 )). Aigeai does not appear in the list of the theorodokoi of Nemea (in 323 ), but its name can be safely restored on the Argive list of contributors ( IG iv 617 . 15 ( c. 300 )), which could be a reference to theoroi (cf. Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 ). Its main deities were Zeus (Arr. Anab . 1 . 11 . 1 ) and Herakles Patroos (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) ii. no. 30 ). Eukleia (SaatsoglouPaliadeli ( 1987 ), ( 1992 )) and the Mother of the Gods (Drougou ( 1996 )) were also popular. Excavations at Vergina-Palatitsia, begun by L. Heuzey in the middle of the nineteenth century and continued since by C. Romaios, and by M. Andronicos and his students, have unearthed, besides the extensive cemetery (Kottaridi ( 2002 )), two palaces, a theatre, an agora, several sanctuaries and other facilities. The great palace ( 104 . 5 × 88 . 5 m), built around a peristyle court, with porticoes on the north and east sides, an extended balcony beyond the north portico and a monumental gate on the east side, belongs to the C4s, but the smaller one, to the west, seems to be earlier and may be the very structure decorated by Zeuxis in C5l (Andronicos ( 1984 ) 38 -46 ; Ginouvès ( 1993 ) 84 -88 ; Saatsoglou-Paliadeli ( 2001 )). The C4s theatre ( TGR ii. 317 ) lay immediately to the north of the palace. Stone benches rose only to the second row (Drougou ( 1997 )). The theatre is mentioned by Diodorus in his account of the murder of Philip in 336 (Diod. 16 . 92 . 5 ff). The agora of the city lay to the north of the theatre; it comprised the C4m temple dedicated to Eukleia (Saatsoglou-Paliadeli ( 1996 )). To the northeast of the palace a sanctuary of the Mother of the Gods was discovered, the earliest building phase of which belongs to C4l (Drougou ( 1996 )). On the acropolis, south of the palace, which dominated the city, no major public buildings have been found (Phaklaris ( 1996 ) 70 -74 ). The C4l circuit wall roughly forms a triangle,with its apex to the south on the acropolis and its base on a line joining the two streams on either side of the acropolis hill probably to the south of the Rhomaios tomb. It is a pseudo-isodomic structure of local stone with towers at irregular intervals. Monumental gates opened from the acropolis to the south, towards Pieria, to the north towards the city, and west of the theatre towards Upper Makedonia (Andronicos et al . ( 1983 ) 42 -45 , ( 1987 ) 146 -48 ; Phaklaris ( 1996 ) 69 -70 ). According to legend, Aigeai was founded by the Temenid Perdikkas or Karanos or Archelaos,alone or with an army of Argive colonists in the C7m or C8e (Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 3 -14 )."
530,Alebaia,Makedonia,,,198,971,"530 . Alebaia Map 50 . Unlocated (but see Hatzopoulos ( 2003 ) for a possible identification with Bravas). Type: A (rC7 ). The toponym is Λεβαίη , ηasper (Hdt. 8 . 137 . 1 ) Αλ ( α ) ιβαῖοι ( sc . τόποι ) ( I.Leukopetra 12 . 4 ( ad 171 / 2 )), Αλεβία ( κώ µ η : I.Leukopetra 106 . 14 ( ad 253 / 4 )). The cityethnic is unattested but was presumably Αλεβαῖος ( I.Leukopetra 12 . 4 ). Alebaia is called a polis , in the urban sense, exclusively in Hdt. 8 . 137 . 1 , in the mythical context of the foundation of the Makedonian state by the Temenids. It is not clear whether Herodotos is considering (A)lebaia to be a polis in his own time or only in the C7 , when the legend he narrates is dated. It is clear, however, that by the Roman period (A)lebaia was not an independent polis but a kome of Elemia, and it is probable that even earlier not (A)lebaia alone but the whole ethnos of the Elemiotai constituted a political unit equivalent to the poleis of Lower Makedonia."

(Allante was most probably situated at Nea Chalkedon (Gounaropoulou and Hatzopoulos ( 1985 ) 56 -61 ). Military action during the First World War and the construction of a modern settlement after 1922 have destroyed practically all ancient remains.) Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is Αταλάντη , ηasper (Thuc. 2 . 100 . 3 ) or Αλλάντειον , τό (Theopomp. fr. 33 ; BCH 45 ( 1921 ) 17 iii . 64 ( 230 -220 )) or Αλάντη ( SEG 36 331 B. 21 ) or Αλλάντη (Steph. Byz. 76 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is [ Αταλα ]-vel [ Αλλα ]-νταῖος ( IG iv617 . 17 (C4l); Αλλανταῖος SEG 35 753 . 12 ( c. ad 198 )); Steph. Byz. 76 . 3 suggests Αλλάντιος ; Pliny's Allantenses ( HN 4 . 35 ) is not helpful. The only classification in literary sources of Allante as a polis is in Steph. Byz. 76 . 1 . The only epigraphic attestation of a πόλις Αλλανταίων is on a c. ad198 milestone from Allante ( SEG 35 753 . 12 ), where the term polis is used in the political sense. Allante is called a chorion in Thuc. 2 . 100 . 3 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested both internally ( SEG 35 753 . 12 ) and externally ( IG iv 617 . 17 ). The territory of Allante bordered on that of Pella to the north-west, Ichnai to the north and Herakleia to the east, across the Axios; to the south it reached the ancient shoreline. Allante was probably a C5e Makedonian foundation designed to cut off the then Paionian city of Ichnai from the sea (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) i. 111 ). Allantaian theorodokoi were appointed to host theoroi from Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .B. 21 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). If the ethnic is correctly restored in IG iv 617 . 17 , Allante is recorded on the Argive list of contributors of C4l, which may be connected with the dispatching of theoroi (cf. Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 )."

The toponym is Αacuteλωρος , ηasper (Ps.Skylax 66 ; Strabo 7 fr. 20 ), and the city-ethnic Αλωρίτης (Diod. 15 . 71 . 1 ). Aloros is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 66 (C4m). The individual use of the ethnic is attested externally in Diod. 15 . 71 . 1 (r 368 ) and Arr. Ind . 18 . 6 (r 320 s). The territory of Aloros bordered on that of Aigeai to the west and Methone to the south, while to the north it must have been delimited by the marshes of Lake Loudiake. Traces of a circuit wall of poros blocks c. 1 km long have been spotted (Hatzopoulos ( 1987 b ) 38 ). Excavations begun in 1988 (Apostolou ( 1998 )) have revealed a C4 two-room building, probably a temple, with an adjoining Archaic structure, probably an altar (Apostolou ( 1991 ))."
533,Beroia (Beroiaios) Maps 49 -50 .,Makedonia,40.3,22.1,859,4552,"533 . Beroia (Beroiaios) Maps 49 -50 . Lat. 40 . 30 ; long. 22 . 10 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Βέροια , ηasper (Thuc. 1 . 61 . 4 ), later spelled Βέρροια (App. Syr . 57 and late Roman sources). The city-ethnic is Βεροιαῖος (unpublished C4s inscription from the Perrhaibian tripolis ; Polyb. 28 . 8 . 2 ); Βεροι ˜ εος in I.Leukopetra 31 . 5 ; Βαιροιαῖος in I.Leukopetra 84 . 4 -5 or Βεροιευacuteς (Polyb. 27 . 8 . 6 ); Βερωαῖος ( IG iv² . 1 96 . 22 ) is probably a mistake. Beroia is first attested as a polis in the political sense in a C4l dedication ( I.Beroia 29 = Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) no. 73 ) and is called a polis in the urban sense in Ps.-Skymnos 626 (C2 ). The term chorion is used by Thuc. 1 . 61 . 4 , and the term polisma by App. Syr . 57 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in an honorific inscription ( I.Beroia 59 (C1 )). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a consecration from the sanctuary of Leukopetra ( I.Leukopetra 31 . 5 ( ad 192 / 3 )) and externally in an unpublished dedication from the Perrhaibian Tripolis (cf. Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) i. 156 , n. 15 (C4s)) and in a C3f Epidaurian list of theorodokoi ( IG iv² . 1 96 . 22 ). The territory of Beroia bordered on that of Mieza to the north, Pella to the north-east, Aigeai to the south-east and on the regions of Eordaia to the north-west and Elemia to the south-west. Among the secondary settlements of the original territory of Beroia, we know the names of Kyneoi, Auranton, Kannonea and Droga (Hatzopoulos ( 1990 )). The constitution of Beroia, like the constitution of all the cities of Makedonia, had a pronounced aristocratic character. Not only slaves, but also freedmen, their sons, male prostitutes and craftsmen were excluded from civic life (Gauthier and Hatzopoulos ( 1993 ) 78 -87 ), and full enfranchisement probably was subject to a minimum census in landed property (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) i. 209 n. 1 ). The chief executive official was the epistates (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) ii. no. 73 ), who-at least later-was assisted by a board of magistrates who may have been called tagoi (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) i. 156 ). The patron deity of Beroia was Herakles Kynagidas, who was revered as the ancestor of the royal family-not only of the Temenids, but also later of the Antigonids (Edson ( 1934 ) 226 -32 ; Allamani-Souri ( 1993 b ); Hatzopoulos ( 1994 a ) 102 -11 ). The cult of Asklepios was also important (Voutiras ( 1993 ) 257 ), and his priest was eponymous, as in all Makedonian cities (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) i. 152 -54 ). His cult was, at least later, associated with those of Apollo and Hygieia ( I.Beroia 16 (C3s)). The cult of Dionysos was an ancient one (cf. the epistylion of the theatre bearing a dedication to the god, I.Beroia 21 (C4l)); with the epithets Agrios, Erikryptos, Pseudanor it is attested only in Imperial times, but, given its archaic character, it certainly had much earlier origins (Hatzopoulos ( 1994 a ) 65 -85 ). From the Heltic period are attested cults of Athena ( I.Beroia 17 ), Ennodia ( I.Beroia 23 ), Hermes ( I.Beroia 24 ), Pan ( I.Beroia 37 ) and Atargatis ( I.Beroia 19 ). Beroia is recorded on the Argive list of contributors ( IG iv 617 . 17 (C4l)), which may be connected with the dispatching of theoroi (cf. Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 ). The failure of the Athenians to capture Beroia in 432 (Thuc. 1 . 61 . 4 ) probably implies that at least part of the city, such as the acropolis situated in the western extremity, was already fortified. Traces of a C4l circuit wall made of local poros have been discovered in different parts of the modern town (Petkos ( 1997 ) 272 ). There were at least three gates, one of which bore the name Ευιαστική ( I.Beroia 41 ; cf. BrocasDeflassieux ( 1999 ) 37 -41 ). The continuous habitation of the site from the Iron Age to the present (cf. Allamani-Souri ( 1993 a ); Allamani-Souri and Apostolou ( 1992 ) 97 ) have left very few traces of the ancient town plan. It is presumed that the ancient agora and main road axes correspond to the modern civic centre and road system (Brocas-Deflassieux ( 1999 ) 99 -101 ). The stadion has been located in the eastern outskirts of the city. Epigraphic finds have permitted the location of the gymnasion -first attested in the Heltic period-in the same area south of the stadion (BrocasDeflassieux ( 1999 ) 87 -90 ). A late Classical or early Heltic epistylion with a dedication to Dionysos ( I.Beroia 21 ) provides evidence for the functioning of the theatre in that period."
534,Dion (Diestes) Maps 49 -50 .,Makedonia,40.1,22.3,879,4466,"534 . Dion (Diestes) Maps 49 -50 . Lat. 40 . 10 , long. 22 . 30 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: [A]. The toponym is ∆ῖον , τό (Thuc. 4 . 78 . 6 ; Staatsverträge 308 . 9 ), ∆εῖον ( SEG 31 630 ). The city-ethnic is ∆ιέστης ( SEG 48 785 ; Steph. Byz. 522 . 3 ) or ∆ιάστης (Paus. 9 . 30 . 8 ) or ∆εῖος (Oikonomos ( 1915 ) no. 4 ) or ∆ιευacuteς (Steph. Byz. 232 . 5 ). The form ∆ιαῖος attested on coins (Hatzopoulos and Psoma ( 1999 ) 10 -12 ) has nothing to do with Makedonian Dion. In Ps.-Skylax, the chapter about Makedonia ( 66 ) opens with πρώτη πόλις Μακεδονίας ' Ηράκλειον , ∆ῖον . . . Thus, Dion is implicitly classified as a polis in the urban sense in C4f, and explicit references are found in later sources, both literary (Paus. 10 . 13 . 5 (rC6l/C5e); cf. CID i 1 ) and epigraphical (Oikonomos ( 1915 ) no. 4 (early second century ad )). Thuc. 4 . 78 . 6 calls Dion a polisma . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a C2e letter of Philip V to the city ( SEG 48 785 ). In the same letter polites occurs (cf. the χηtildeραι πολίτιδες in a Heltic catalogue of names: Pandermalis ( 2002 ) 381 -82 ). The territory of Classical Dion bordered on that of Leibethra to the south, Pydna to the north-east and possibly Phylakai to the north-west. We know the name of only one of its secondary settlements: Pimpleia, called kome by Strabo at 7 fr. 17 , which was famous because of its connection with the legend of Orpheus and the cult of the Muses (Schmidt ( 1950 )). Dion was the religious centre of Makedonia at least from C5 and probably much earlier (cf. Diod. 17 . 16 . 3 ). The patron deity of Dion was Olympian Zeus,to whom the city owed its name (Just. 24 . 2 . 8 ) and who was venerated along with the Muses (Diod. 7 . 16 . 3 ). Other communal cults were those of Demeter, Dionysos, the Mother of the Gods, Aphrodite, Baubo, Orpheus,Athena, Eileithyia, Asklepios and Hermes. Sarapis and Isis are also attested from early Heltic times onwards (Pandermalis ( 1977 ), ( 1993 ); Hatzopoulos ( 1994 b ) 106 ). The most important religious but also political event at Dion, and in Makedonia as a whole, was the panegyris of Olympia held in the month of Dios and lasting nine days (Diod. 17 . 16 . 4 ). Among other contests it included the pentathlon , the dolichos and the taurotheria (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) i. 129 n. 2 ; cf. BE ( 1978 ) no. 232 ). Dion maintained close relations with Delphi from the Archaic period ( CID i 1 (C6 /C5e); cf. Paus. 10 . 13 . 5 and Mari ( 2002 ) 29 -31 ). From a C4m fiscal law (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) ii. no. 56 ) and a C4l decree (ibid. no. 57 ), both unpublished, we are informed that Dion had fewer than ten archontes and at least two tamiai . The site of Dion comprises the sanctuaries area in the open plain and the walled city to its north. The latter occupies an area of c. 43 ha, which justifies the descriptions of Thuc. 4 . 78 . 6 ( πόλισ µ α ) and Livy 44 . 7 . 3 ( urbem non magnam ). The rectangular grid-line of the street planning, leaving an open space for the agora, is contemporary with the erection of the walls (Stephanidou-Tiveriou ( 1998 ) 216 -23 ). These, 2 . 60 -3 . 30 m wide, date from C4l and were probably built by Kassandros (after 305 ?). In their pre-Roman phase they had a regular rectangular perimeter of c. 2 , 625 m and about sixty towers. Of a probable total of at least six or seven gates, four have been identified so far. One of the northern ones, leading to two consecutive courtyards, was probably the main entry to the city. The walls were built from local conglomerate stone. Above the stone substructure rose a brick superstructure of indeterminate height (Stephanidou-Tiveriou ( 1988 )). In the open plain several sanctuaries have been located: two megaron -shaped temples of Demeter adjacent to each other (in which the Mother of the Gods, Baubo and Hypolympidia Aphrodite were probably worshipped as well) date from C6l (Pingiatoglou ( 1996 ); Pandermalis ( 1999 ) 60 -73 ); near the theatre lay the small C5 temple of Asklepios (Pandermalis ( 1999 ) 84 -87 ); finally, the famous temple and temenos of Olympian Zeus has now been located in the south-eastern part of the sanctuaries area (Pandermalis ( 1999 ) 44 -59 , ( 2000 ) 291 -92 ). Other important public buildings in the open plain are the C4e theatre, which was rebuilt in Heltic times (Karadedos ( 1986 ) 337 -40 ) and the C6l stadion (Leake ( 1835 ) 409 and now Pandermalis ( 1999 ) 76 , 80 -81 )."

The toponym is /acuteΕδεσσα , ηasper ( IG iv 617 . 16 (C4l); Strabo 7 . 7 . 4 ). The city-ethnic is ' Εδεσσαῖος ( F. Delphes iii . 3 207 . 2 (C3m)), also spelt ' Εδεσσε ˜ ος (Tataki ( 1994 ) no. 56 ). Edessa is called a polis in Diod. 31 . 8 . 8 (r 167 ), probably in the political, urban and territorial senses combined. For late attestations of the urban sense, see Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 . 39 (cf. 17 ), and for the political sense, see Demitsas no. 3 (second or third century ad ). The term polisma is attested in App. Syr . 57 , and the term polites in Antoninus ( 1879 ) 227 , no. 26 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in SEG 36 615 . 4 ( c. ad 200 ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in Cormack ( 1973 ) no. 4 (second century ad ) and externally in F.Delphes iii . 3 207 . 2 (C3m). The territory of Edessa bordered on the region of Almopia to the north, on the territories of Kyrrhos to the east,on those of Marinia and Skydra to the south,and on the region of Eordaia to the west (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) i. 112 ). The constitution of Edessa is known to us only from inscriptions of the Roman period (e.g. SEG 24 531 . 6 ( ad 180 / 1 )), which is also the earliest attested public enactment; Antoninus ( 1879 ) 227 , no. 26 ). Edessaians were granted proxenia by Delphi ( F.Delphes iii . 3 207 . 2 (C3m)) and Haliartos ( IG vii 2848 . 4 (C3 ?)), and received citizenship from Larisa ( SEG 27 202 ( 220 -210 )). Edessa is recorded on the Argive list of contributors of C4l, which may be connected with the dispatching of theoroi ( IG iv 617 . 16 ; cf. Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 ). The cult of Herakles is mentioned by Hesychius, s.v. ' Εδεσσαῖος , and is attested epigraphically (Struck ( 1902 ) 310 no. 15 and, with the epithet Kynagidas, in two unpublished C2s and C1m inscriptions). From the same period date inscriptions referring to the cults of Zeus Hypsistos (P. Chrysostomou ( 1989 -91 ) 30 -34 ) and Parthenos (Hatzopoulos ( 1995 )). Evidence for other cults is of later date. A probably C4l (A. Chrysostomou ( 1988 ) 60 , ( 1996 ) 174 ) wall enclosed both the acropolis (triangular perimeter, one tower on the north-west apex of the triangle and one on each of the west and north sides) and the lower city (polygonal perimeter, 2 . 4 -3 m wide) covering an area of 3 . 5 and 23 ha respectively (A. Chrysostomou ( 1987 ), ( 1996 )). The walls are mentioned by Polyaen. 2 . 29 . 2 (r 274 ). The only public monuments known are the temple of Ma and its stoas, which are epigraphically attested (Hatzopoulos ( 1995 ) 126 ). The site has been occupied continuously since the Bronze Age, which accounts for the lack of Archaic and Classical remains (A. Chrysostomou ( 1996 ) 180 -82 ); however, Livy 45 . 30 . 5 refers to Edessa as among the urbes nobiles of central Makedonia in 167 , and it was presumably already so in the Classical period."

The toponym is Ευρωπός , ηasper (Thuc. 2 . 100 . 3 ; Strabo 7 . 7 . 9 ; cf. Kotzias, AA 54 ( 1939 ) 257 (inscribed tiles)), ' Ωρωπός (App. Syr . 57 ; BCH 45 ( 1921 ) 17 , iii . 62 ). The city-ethnic is Ευρωπαῖος ( F.Delphes iii . 4 405 . 3 (C3e)) or Ευρώπιος ( I. Oropos 98 (C3l)). Europos is called a polis in the urban sense in Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 . 36 (cf. 17 ) and in the political sense in two honorific decrees for Roman generals ( SEG 41 570 ( c. 110 ), 42 575 ( c. 39 -38 )). Thuc. 2 . 100 . 3 calls Europos a chorion . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in SEG 41 570 ( c. 110 ) and externally in the C4l contribution list from Argos ( IG iv 617 . 17 ). For the earliest individual use of the city-ethnic,see the proxenia decree from Delphi ( F.Delphes iii . 4 405 . 3 (C4l)). The territory of Europos bordered on those of Pella to the south-west, Ichnai to the south-east and Gortynia to the north. Citizens of Europos received the proxenia at Delphi ( F.Delphes iii . 4405 . 3 (C4l)).A cult of Artemis Elaphebolos is attested in a C3 inscription ( SEG 43 399 ). The Europaians are recorded in the Argive list of contributors of C4l, which may be connected with the dispatching of theoroi ( IG iv617 . 17 ; cf. Perlman ( 2000 ) 74 ). Europos was most probably a walled city in 429 , since Sitalkes besieged it but was unable to capture it (Thuc. 2 . 100 . 3 ). Of its public buildings we know only of an aqueduct mentioned in an inscription of Imperial times ( SEG 38 608 ). Ongoing excavations aim to delimit the settlement; sporadic finds, such as an unpublished late Archaic kouros (Savvopoulou ( 1988 ) 137 ), testify to Europos' importance as a trading centre of the Axios valley."
537,Herakleion (Herakleiotes),Makedonia,40.0,22.4,280,1381,"537 . Herakleion (Herakleiotes) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 00 , long. 22 . 40 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: A. The toponym is ' Ηράκλειον , τό (Damastes ( FGrHist 5 ) fr. 4 . 3 ; Ps.-Skylax 66 ; IG i³ 77 . v . 21 ( /asperΕράκλειον )), ' Ηράκλεια , ηasper (Steph. Byz. 304 . 3 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ηρακλειώτης ( Gonnoi 93 ). Herakleion is called a polis in the urban sense in Ps.-Skylax 66 . The collective use of the ethnic is attested externally in Gonnoi 93 B. 24 (C3l)). The territory of Herakleion bordered on that of Gonnoi to the south-west (see the dossier in Gonnoi 93 -107 ), Leibethra on the north and possibly Homolion, beyond the Peneios,before the foundation of Phila on the mouth of that river in Heltic times. Herakleion became a member of the Delian League some time between 430 / 29 and 425 / 4 or, at least, the Athenians claimed its membership and had it assessed for a tribute of 1 , 000 drachmas ( IG i³ 71 . iv . 108 , completely restored; 77 . v . 21 ). Herakleion appears as a walled city in 169 (Polyb. 28 . 11 . 1 ; Livy 44 . 9 . 1 -9 ), but its fortifications most probably date from C5 , since the city could successfully challenge the authority of Perdikkas II and remain a member of the Delian League for years. Presumably, the walls covered the entire hill, since Heuzey ( 1860 ) 92 -93 saw remains of them at the bottom of the hill, near the river bank."
538,Ichnai (Ichnaios),Makedonia,40.45,22.35,507,2614,"538 . Ichnai (Ichnaios) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 45 , long. 22 . 35 . (On the location of Ichnai on the right bank of the Axios, see Hatzopoulos ( 2001 ) 159 -60 .) Size of territory: ? Type: A. The toponym is /acuteΙχναι , αιasper (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 3 ; BCH 45 ( 1921 ) 17 . iii . 63 ), Αacuteχναι (Eratosthenes according to Steph. Byz. 342 . 17 , but probably referring to the Thessalian Ichnai; cf. Steph. Byz. 152 . 16 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ιχναῖος ( IG ii² 8944 (undated)). Ichnai is called a polis in the urban sense in Hdt. 7 . 123 . 3 and in the political sense in a treaty(?) between that city and Dikaia(?) (Struck ( 1902 ) 310 no. 15 . 2 (undated)). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins of C5e ( infra ) and in inscriptions (Struck ( 1902 ) 309 no. 14 . 6 and 310 no. 15 . 2 ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested in a Delphic C3m proxeny decree ( F.Delphes iii . 3 207 . 3 (C3m)) and in an undated Attic sepulchral inscription ( IG ii² 8944 ). The name of the territory of Ichnai might be ' Ιχναίων χώρα (Hsch. s.v. ' Ιχναίαν , unless the reference is to the homonymous Thessalian city). It bordered on the territories of Pella to the south-west,Allante to the south,Tyrissa to the north-west, and probably Herakleia in Mygdonia to the east, across the Axios. The probable site of the urban centre has been totally destroyed by intense agricultural activity ( ArchDelt 49 ( 1994 ) Chron . 455 ). Two fragments of an inscription of unknown date might belong to a treaty between Ichnai and Dikaia (Papazoglou ( 1988 ) 155 -56 ). A citizen of Ichnai was awarded proxenia by Delphi ( F.Delphes iii . 3 207 . 3 (C3m)); another Ichnaian was appointed theorodokos for theoroi arriving from the same city ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) 17 iii . 63 ( c. 220 )). Judging by the onomastic evidence, Ichnai must have been originally a Paionian settlement which already in Archaic times received an influx of Southern Greek colonists. After the Makedonian conquest, settlers from the Old Kingdom were added to its population (cf.Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) i. 107 n. 1 ). It seems that citizens of Ichnai, in their turn, participated in the Makedonian colonisation of Amphipolis (Hatzopoulos ( 1991 ) 86 ). Before the Makedonian conquest, Ichnai struck silver staters and octadrachms ( c. 490 -480 ). Types: obv . male figure, usually between two bulls, or beside a horse; rev . wheel, or cross in an incuse square; legend: [ ΙΧ ] ΝΑΙ [ ΟΝ ], ΙΧΝΑΙ , ΙΧΝΑΟΝ , ΙΧΝΑΙΟΝ (Gaebler ( 1935 ) 63 -65 ; Price and Waggoner ( 1975 ) 29 -30 , 117 ; Papazoglou ( 1988 ) 155 ; SNG Cop.

The toponym is Κυacuteρρος , ηasper (Thuc. 2 . 100 . 4 ; Steph. Byz. 430 . 17 ; Vavritsas ( 1977 ) 8 ), Κυacuteρνος (Diod. 18 . 4 . 5 , MSS, apparently a mistake), Κυacuteριος (in the MS of Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 . 36 ; cf. the form Scurio ( It. Burd . 606 . 3 ). The city-ethnic is Κυρρέστης ( SEG 40 520 ; Plin. HN 4 . 34 : Cyrrestae ; cf. SEG 27 258 (Roman)) or Κυρραῖος ( SEG 43 435 . 3 (early third century ad )). The only attestations of Kyrrhos as a polis (in the urban sense) are Plin. HN 4 . 34 and Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 . 36 (cf. 17 ), but its mention alongside Dion and Amphipolis in Alexander's ' Υπο µ νή µ ατα ( infra ) leaves no doubt that Kyrrhos too was a polis already in C4 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on a second century ad boundary stone ( SEG 40 520 ). For the individual and external use of the city-ethnic, see SEG 43 435 (early third century ad ). The territory of Kyrrhos bordered on the territories of Edessa to the west, Skydra to the south-west, Pella to the south-east, Tyrissa to the east, and Europos to the northeast. An unpublished C3 decree (cf. Vavritsas ( 1977 )) reveals that Genderrhos was a kome of Kyrrhos.The name of another meros ( kome ?) of the city, Mandarai, is preserved in Steph. Byz. 430 . 17 . The earliest public enactment of Kyrrhos is an unpublished C3 decree concerning public works in the vicinity and in the agora of the city (Vavritsas ( 1977 )). Kyrrhos was renowned for its sanctuary of Athena Kyrrhestis, which was located on the hill of Palaiokastron (Vavritsas ( 1977 )). It would be tempting to interpret the mass of semi-worked limestone blocks in a nearby C4s quarry (Bakalakis ( 1970 )) as preliminary work for the ναοgraveς πολυτελής of Athena which Alexander was planning to built in Kyrrhos (Diod. 18 . 4 . 5 ); two C4l/C3e poros capitalsprobably of a temple-may attest a later attempt to implement Alexander's plan (Haddad ( 1993 ); Adam-Veleni ( 1998 ) 6 ). The sanctuary of Artemis Agrotera is known from dedications of the Roman period (Panayotou and Chrysostomou ( 1993 ) 379 -80 ). The agora of the city is mentioned several times in the C3 unpublished decree (Vavritsas ( 1977 ) 8 ; Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) i. 438 -39 ). The patron deity of Kyrrhos was Athena, for whom Alexander was planning to build a magnificent temple at the time of his death (Diod. 18 . 4 . 5 ). The cult of Athena Kyrrhestis, which is also attested epigraphically ( SEG 27 258 (Roman)), was transferred to the homonymous city in Syria. Other communal cults were those of Artemis Agrotera (attested by Roman evidence: SEG 30 553 -54 , 35 750 , 43 404 -5 ) and of Zeus Hypsistos (P. Chrysostomou ( 1989 -91 ) 40 -41 )."

The city-ethnic is Λειβήθριος (Arist. fr. 552 ; Gonnoi 2 . 6 ) or Λιβήθριος (Paus. 9 . 30 . 11 ). Leibethra is called a polis in the urban sense in Paus. 9 . 30 . 9 , referring to the mythical period. The term patris is used in Orph . Argonaut . 1374 . Alternative site-classifications are ethnos (Arist. fr. 552 ), chorion or oros (Strabo 10 . 3 . 17 ), topos (Hsch., s.v. λείβηθρον ) and σκοπιή (Lyc. Alex . 275 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on an inscribed weight of one mina ( SEG 27 283 (undated)) and externally in Arist. fr. 563 and in a C3e decree from Gonnoi ( Gonnoi 2 . 6 ). Originally populated by Thracian Pieres, Leibethra and this part of Pieria were conquered by the Makedonians c. C7 (Strabo 10 . 3 . 17 ; cf. Hammond ( 1972 ) 417 ). According to the legend mentioned by Pausanias ( 9 . 30 . 11 ), the city was destroyed by the river Sys. The topography of the site and the remains of the walls make such a 'destruction'by the four torrents in the area quite possible (Kotzias ( 1948 -49 ) 33 -34 ), although the continued existence of the city is secured by Classical (Pritchett ( 1991 ) 127 ) and Heltic (Kotzias ( 1948 -49 ) 34 ) remains, by the mention of the city in the C3 inscription from Gonnoi ( Gonnoi 2 . 6 ) and by the C3l Delphic list of theorodokoi ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) 17 iii . 53 ). The territory of Leibethra probably extended from the mountainous area of Lower Olympos to the valley of Sys (Helly ( 1973 ) 35 -36 ; Gonnoi 5 ). The city bordered on Gonnoi to the south-west, presumably on Herakleion to the south, and Dion to the north. The cults of Orpheus, the Nymphs, the Muses and Dionysos are attested in literary sources (Kotzias ( 1948 -49 ) 26 -28 ). The cult of the latter deity has now found a possible archaeological confirmation ( SEG 27 283 ). The legend of the city's destruction mentions the existence of walls (Paus. 9 . 30 . 11 ). Kotzias (( 1948 -49 ) 33 -34 ), who excavated the site, discovered part of a circuit of 1 . 5 m-wide walls. According to Pritchett (( 1991 ) 127 ), the circuit was no more than 500 m long. Recent work has confirmed that the acropolis ( 1 . 5 ha) was walled and that the site was not abandoned until C1 ( ArchDelt 50 ( 1995 ) Chron . 497 -98 )."
541,Methone (Methonaios) Maps 49 -50 .,Makedonia,40.3,22.35,729,3435,"541 . Methone (Methonaios) Maps 49 -50 . Lat. 40 . 30 , long. 22 . 35 . Size of territory: 3 ? Type: A. The toponym is Μεθώνη , ηasper (Thuc. 6 . 7 . 3 ; IG ii² 130 ), Μεθώνα ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i b. 8 ). The city-ethnic is Μεθωναῖος ( IG i³ 61 ; Thuc. 4 . 129 . 4 ; Arist. frr. 551 -52 ). Methone is called a polis both in the urban sense (Dem. 9 . 26 ; Ps.-Skylax 66 ) and in the political sense ( IG i³ 61 . 44 -45 ; Plut. Mor . 293 B, probably derived from Aristotle's treatise). In Din. 1 . 14 polis is used in both senses simultaneously. The politai of Methone are mentioned in Diod. 16 . 34 . 5 (r 354 ), and there was an Aristotelian Methonaion politeia (frr. 551 -52 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ) and externally in IG i³ 61 . 1 . For the individual and external use of the city-ethnic, see e.g. IG ii² 9330 (C5l). According to Thuc. 6 . 7 . 3 , Methone bordered on Makedonia ( τηgraveν οasperacute µ ορον ΜακεδονίΩsubiotaα ), and its territory ( τ ˜ ες χόρας τ ˜ ες Μεθ [ ο ] ναίον ) is mentioned in IG i³ 61 . 22 . The territory of Classical Methone bordered on that of Pydna to the south and Aloros to the north-west. The size of the territory must have been close to 100 km ² , perhaps a little more. After 354 it must have been added to that of Pydna (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) i. 181 ). Methone was originally a Thracian settlement. It was colonised by Eretrians c. 730 (Hammond ( 1972 ) 425 -26 ) and joined the Delian League after 431 (for the date and the erroneous restoration of the ethnic in IG i³ 280 . ii . 67 , see Piérart ( 1988 )). It belonged to the Thracian district and is registered in the tribute lists from 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 33 , restored) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . iii . 8 ) a total of three times, paying a phoros of 3 tal. ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 53 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 157 ( 5 tal.), ethnic completely restored). In 364 or 363 it was captured by the Athenian Timotheos (Din. 1 . 14 = 3 . 17 ) and became an ally of Athens but probably without becoming a member of the Second Athenian Naval League (Dreher ( 1995 ) 26 ). Methone was conquered and destroyed by Philip II in 354 (Dem. 4 . 4 ; Diod. 16 . 31 . 6 and 34 . 4 -5 ). The inhabitants were allowed to leave the city with one garment each; the city itself was razed to the ground, and its territory distributed to Makedonian settlers. A few decades later, old Methone was succeeded by a new settlement 1 km to the north-west of the former city, which, however, did not enjoy the status of polis but was probably a kome of Pydna (Hatzopoulos et al . ( 1990 ); for the origin of the new settlers, see Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) i. 180 -81 ). Our only information about the constitutional arrangements of Methone concerns its magistrates, the archontes and the polemarchos mentioned in Arist. fr. 551 . A Methonaian theorodokos hosted the theoroi from Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 94 .b. 8 ) c. 360 . Another Methonaian is known to have been granted citizenship in Ephesos ( I.Ephesos 48 (C4l)). Methone was a walled city in 354 (Dem. 1 . 9 ; Theopomp. fr. 52 ; Polyaen. 4 . 2 . 15 ; Just. Epit . 7 . 6 . 14 ). No remains of the walls are visible today. Methone struck only one type of bronze coinage in C4f. Types: obv . female head to the r.; rev . lion breaking spear; legend: ΜΕΘΩ (Gaebler ( 1935 ) 78 -79 ; Psoma ( 2001 ) 115 )."
542,Mieza (Miezaios/Miezeus),Makedonia,40.4,22.05,456,2298,"542 . Mieza (Miezaios/Miezeus) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 40 , long. 22 . 05 . Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is Μίεζα , ηasper (Plut. Alex . 7 . 4 ), Μέζα ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) 17 , iii . 59 ), Μυacuteεζα (in the MS of Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 . 36 ); the alternative name Στρυ µ όνιον given by Steph. Byz. 452 . 1 (perhaps quoting Theagenes ( FGrHist 774 ) fr. 7 ) is probably an epithet. The city-ethnic is Μιεζαῖος (Theagenes ( FGrHist 774 ) fr. 7 ), later spelt Μιεζ ˜ εος ( I.Leukopetra 71 . 8 -9 ), or Μιεζευacuteς (Arr. Ind . 18 . 6 (r 325 )). Mieza is called a polis in the urban sense by Steph. Byz. 452 . 1 , possibly quoting Theagenes ( FGrHist 774 ) fr. 7 (C3 ); cf. Ptol. Geog . 3 . 12 . 36 (cf. 17 ). For the individual use of the cityethnic, see Arr. Ind . 18 . 6 . The territory of Mieza is called Μιεζ ˜ εοι τόποι in I.Leukopetra 71 . 8 -9 ; we know the names of two settlements that were probably its komai , Gaimeion and Nea [---] ( SEG 24 524 (C3 )). It bordered on the territory of Beroia to the south, Marinia to the north-west, and Skydra to the northeast. Among the magistrates, the eponymous priest of Asklepios, the epistates , tagoi and dikastai are attested in the Heltic period ( SEG 24 524 (C2f)), and at least the priest of Asklepios and the epistates are likely to have existed since C4 (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) i. 156 ). The cults of Asklepios ( SEG 24 524 (C2f)), the Nymphs (Plut. Alex . 7 . 4 ), Artemis ( SEG 24 525 -26 ), Herakles Kallinikos (Demitsas ( 1896 ) no. 18 ) and the river god Olganos (Kallipolitis ( 1952 )) are attested in Mieza. Although the archaeological complex of LeukadiaKopanos-Naoussa was well known from the nineteenth century, only most recently have excavations started at the very site of the ancient city (Rhomiopoulou ( 1997 )). A large (over 106 m long) C4stoa, which might form part of a Asklepieion complex, has come to light (Allamani-Souri and Misaelidou ( 1992 ) 203 -12 ; Allamani-Souri et al. ( 2002 )). Moreover, the school that Aristotle founded in Mieza (Plut. Alex . 7 . 4 ) is almost certainly to be identified with the building complex at Isvoria, to the south-west of the civic centre, where three caves are joined by elaborate peripatoi , niches, stoas and staircases (Siganidou and Trochides ( 199o ), with earlier refs.)."
543,Pella (Pellaios) Maps 49 -50 .,Makedonia,40.45,22.3,1212,6228,"543 . Pella (Pellaios) Maps 49 -50 . Lat. 40 . 45 , long. 22 . 30 . Size of territory: 4 (P. Chrysostomou ( 1990 ) 223 ). Type: A. The toponym is Πέλλα , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 3 ; Thuc. 2 . 99 . 4 ; Syll . ³ 267 A. 4 ), earlier (or as an epithet?) Βουacuteνο µ ος or Βουνό µ εια (Steph. Byz. 515 . 7 -8 ). The city-ethnic is Πελλαῖος (Arvanitopoulos ( 1909 ) no. 16 ; Arr. Anab . 3 . 5 . 3 ). The alternative forms Πελληναῖος of Plut. Mor . 339 B and Πελληνός of Steph. Byz. 515 . 9 -10 are otherwise unknown. Pella is called a polis in the urban sense in Hdt. 7 . 123 . 3 and Ps.-Skylax 66 . At Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 13 , µ εγίστη τῶν εν Μακεδονίας πόλεων is used about Pella both in the personal-political and in the urban sense.The earliest attestation of polis in a purely political sense is in the asylia decree for Kos ( SEG 12 374 . 9 ( 243 )). In a verse dedication of Queen Eurydika,wife of Amyntas II, πολῖτις is used about the female citizens, presumably of Pella (Plut. Mor . 14 B with BE ( 1984 ) 249 ). Pella is called a polisma in App. Syr . 57 and a metropolis in Strabo 16 . 2 . 10 . Ps.Skylax 66 writes: πόλις καιgrave βασίλειον εν αυτηsubiotaηtilde (C4m). πατρίς is used about Pella in a C4s epigram from Delphi ( SEG 18 222 a), in AG 7 . 139 (C1 ) and in Strabo 16 . 2 . 10 . Demosthenes' description of Pella as a χωρίΩsubiotaω αδόξΩsubiotaω . . . καιgrave µ ικρΩsubiotaῶ ( 18 . 68 (rC4e)) is clearly a rhetorical distortion (cf. Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 13 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in the C2f coinage of the city (Gaebler ( 1935 ) 93 -97 ) and externally in the asylia decree for Kos ( SEG 12 374 ( 243 )). For the individual use of the city-ethnic, see Arr. Ind . 18 . 3 (r 325 ), and Arvanitopoulos ( 1909 ) no. 16 (C3e). Pella's extensive territory, Πελλαία (Strabo 7 fr. 20 ), bordered on the territories of Allante to the south-east, Ichnai to the east, Tyrissa to the north, and Kyrrhos to the north-west and to the west. We know the sites of five secondary settlements, at Archontikon, Damianon B, Agrosykia, Leptokarya B and Ag. Nikolaos (Krya Vrysi), and two suburbs, one to the north-west and one to the west of the city (P . Chrysostomou ( 1990 ); Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) i. 111 -12 ). Pella,originally a Paionian settlement,received an important Ionian influx from early Archaic times. It became a member of the Chalkidian Federation for a brief period in the 380 s (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 13 ). The transfer of the royal residence to the city in the reign of Amyntas III was accompanied by a significant Makedonian migration which transformed the character of the city, as the onomastics and the archaeological remains show (Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 56 ; Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) i. 171 -73 ). There is no evidence for the Classical constitution of Pella; in C3 there is evidence of an archon , an epistates ( SEG 48 818 ), a boule and a demos ( SEG 48 817 ) as well as tamiai ( SEG 12 374 ). In C4s ( Syll . ³ 267 ; SEG 18 222 a) and in C3m ( F.Delphes iii . 3 207 . 2 ) several citizens of Pella received the proxenia of Delphi. The patron divinity of Pella was Athena Alkidemos (Livy 42 . 51 . 2 ; cf. Gaebler ( 1935 ) 93 -97 ). Among other cults, those of Apollo, Artemis, Asklepios, Dionysos, Zeus Meilichios, Herakles Kynagidas, Herakles Phylakos, the Muses and Pan are attested from epigraphic, literary and archaeological sources ( SEG 24 540 ; Papakonstantinou-Diamantourou ( 1971 ) 38 -51 ; P . Chrysostomou ( 1989 ) 105 -6 ). Moreover, the C4l sanctuaries of the Mother of the Gods, of Demeter and of Darron have been uncovered in or near the city (Lilimpaki-Akamati ( 1987 ), ( 1990 ), ( 1991 ), ( 1996 ), ( 2000 ), ( 2002 )). For none of the cults do we have evidence from the Classical period. A Pellaian theorodokos was appointed to host theoroi from Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .B. 23 -24 ( 323 -317 ); for the identification of the theorodokos , see Knoepfler ( 2001 ) 187 -90 ).A citizen of Pella was victorious in the Isthmian and Pythian Games ( SEG 18 222 a (C4s)). Pella was the largest city of Makedonia; for a general description, see Lilimpaki-Akamati ( 2002 ). The rectangular C4s wall is of mudbrick upon a stone foundation and predates the C4l grid plan of the town (Siganidou ( 1987 a )). The city had two citadels. The acropolis, situated on the northern hill and covering an area of 6 ha, is entirely occupied by the palatial complex.At the southern end of the city the islet Phakos in Lake Loudiake, which was connected with the mainland via a drawbridge,qualified as an άκρα and housed the central Makedonian treasury (Strabo 7 fr. 20 ). The city was built on a regular Hippodamian grid line with two main north-south roads and one west-east road crossing them in the agora area (Siganidou ( 1990 )). The 200 × 182 m-wide agora is surrounded by stoas: the north one probably housed the seat of the politarchs, while on the north-west side of the agora probably lay the city archive; along with the building complex around it, the agora covers an area of ten blocks in the centre of the city (Akamatis ( 1999 )). The palace of the Makedonian kings (central complex C4f) covers the entire acropolis area ( 6 ha) north of the agora. It consists of three building complexes, along an east-west axis. Each building complex is composed of two buildings, one to the south, towards the city, and one to the north. All three southern buildings have a large peristyle court. The northern buildings of the west and central complex have bathing facilities. A long stoa of more than 153 m with a 15 m-wide propylon forms the southern façade of the central and east complex facing the city (Siganidou ( 1987 b ), ( 1996 ); Ginouvès ( 1994 ) 88 -91 ; P. Chrysostomou ( 1996 )). Other public buildings uncovered are a large C4l tholos, probably a heroon of Herakles and used as bouleuterion by the Makedonian Council (Hadzisteliou-Price ( 1973 )) and the sanctuaries of the Mother of the Gods and Aphrodite in the agora area, of Demeter in the south-east quarter of the city, and of Darron in the south-west quarter (LilimbakiAkamati ( 1987 ), ( 1990 ), ( 1991 ), ( 1996 ), ( 2000 )). A theatre is mentioned by Plutarch in a C4s context ( Mor . 1096 B)."

The toponym is Πυacuteδνα , ηasper (Thuc. 1 . 61 . 2 ; Gonnoi 98 . 7 ), Πυacuteτνα ( IG ii² 329 . 13 = Staatsverträge 403 ), Κυacuteδνα , which is considered to be the authentic form of the name (Theagenes ( FGrHist 774 ) fr. 5 = Steph. Byz. 390 . 8 -10 ). The city-ethnic is Πυδναῖος (Dem. 1 . 5 ; Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) ii. no. 55 ), Πυνδναῖος , Πυδδναῖος (only on coins: Tselekas ( 1996 ) 14 ); Πυτναῖος ( IG ii² 339 . b. 3 ). Pydna is called a polis in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 66 ) and is listed as a polis in the urban and political senses simultaneously at Din. 1 . 14 = 3 . 17 . The term asty is attested in Polyaen. 4 . 11 . 3 (r 317 ), and the term polichnion in a scholion on Arist. Rh . 1411 a 9 . The earliest epigraphical attestation of the πόλις Πυδναίων is in an honorific decree of c. 169 (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) ii. no. 55 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and externally perhaps on a fragmentary asylia decree ( SEG 12 374 . 16 ( 243 )). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in an honorific decree (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 b ) ii. no. 55 . 2 ( c. 169 )) and externally in a C4s Athenian proxeny decree ( IG ii² 339 .b. 3 ( 333 )). The territory of Classical Pydna bordered on that of Methone to the north and of Dion to the south, and may have covered over 200 km ² . As the recent excavations have shown, Pydna was not a colonial foundation but a Makedonian settlement (Bessios and Pappa ( 1996 ) 5 ). Already in the reign of Alexander I it belonged to the Makedonian kingdom (Thuc. 1 . 137 . 1 ). In 432 it was unsuccessfully besieged by the Athenians (Thuc. 1 . 61 ). In 410 it rebelled against King Archelaos and seceded from the kingdom, but it was besieged again, and captured after a long siege. Its inhabitants were transferred some 4 km inland, perhaps to modern Kitros (Diod. 13 . 49 . 2 ). Apparently the old site was reoccupied already in C4e (Bessios ( 1990 ) 241 ), and in the reign of Amyntas III Pydna seems for a time to have again successfully seceded from the kingdom, since it struck its own coins; but in the reign of Alexander II, at the latest, it seems to have returned to the fold of the kingdom (Hatzopoulos ( 1985 ) 253 n. 66 ; for a different interpretation of the numismatic evidence, see Tselekas ( 1996 ) 19 -24 ). In 364 or 363 it was captured by Timotheos (Din. 1 . 14 = 3 . 17 ; for the date see Diod. 15 . 81 . 6 ) and became an ally of Athens, but probably without becoming a member of the Second Athenian Naval League (Dreher ( 1995 ) 26 ). In 357 it was besieged and captured by Philip II (Dem. 1 . 9 ; Diod. 16 . 8 . 3 ), presumably by being betrayed to the Makedonians (Dem. 20 . 63 , see Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 242 -44 ); it thereafter remained an integral part of the Makedonian kingdom. Only two temples are attested in the Classical period: that of Athena ( IG ii² 329 . 13 = Staatsverträge 403 ( 336 )) and that posthumously erected in honour of Amyntas III (Habicht ( 1970 ) 11 -12 ). Pydnaian theorodokoi received theoroi from Epidauros c. 360 ( IG iv² 94 i .b. 7 ). Pydna was a walled city at least from 432 (Thuc. 1 . 61 . 3 , implicitly; cf. Diod. 19 . 49 . 1 (r 317 )), but probably already in C5e (Bessios and Pappa ( 1996 ) 5 -6 ). Traces of the walls were seen by Hammond (( 1984 ) 377 ). The area enclosed by the walls was c. 25 ha, making Pydna one of the largest Makedonian cities in C5e, undoubtedly because of the importance of its harbour (Bessios and Pappa ( 1996 ) 6 ). Pydna struck bronze coins in C4f. ( 1 ) During the reign of Amyntas III, types: obv . head of young Herakles wearing lion skin to the r.; rev . eagle with closed wings to the r. devouring serpent which it holds with its talons; legend: ΠΥ∆ΝΑΙΩΝ or ΠΥΝ∆ΝΑΙΩΝ and once ΠΥ∆∆ΝΑΙΩΝ .

The toponym is Απολλωνία , ηasper (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 11 ; Dem. 9 . 26 ; IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 5 ( 359 )). The city-ethnic is Απολλωνιάτης (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 13 ). Apollonia is called a polis in the political and urban senses combined by Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 11 (Hansen ( 2000 a ) 210 ), and in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 66 (Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ) and Dem. 9 . 26 . The collective use of the city-ethnic (abbreviated as ΑΠΟΛΛΩ ) is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and externally at Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 13 . It appears from Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 11 that the toponym Απολλωνία could denote the territory as well as the town. There has been some discussion as to how many Apollonias there were in the Chalkidic peninsula and where exactly they were located. Hatzopoulos ( 1994 ) has come to the conclusion that there was only one Apollonia,and that it was located near the southern shores of Lake Bolbe, i.e. in ancient Mygdonia; see also Flensted-Jensen ( 1997 ) 117 -21 . Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 11 calls Apollonia and Akanthos (no. 559 ) the two largest poleis around Olynthos (no. 588 ), and relates how in 382 they sent envoys to Sparta (no. 345 ) to ask for help against the expanding Chalkidian Federation. Apollonia is recorded in the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi of 359 ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 15 ). Remains of an undated city wall are reported by Hatzopoulos ( 1994 ) 178 . Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 6 mentions Apollonia's proasteion and its gates.According to Dem. 9 . 26 , Apollonia was destroyed by Philip II, though when is unknown. Apollonia struck coins in C4 , and after 187 (Gaebler ( 1926 ), ( 1935 ) 46 -47 ). Obv . head of Apollo; rev . aquatic bird, or fish; legend: ΑΠΟΛΛΩ . Since Apollonia is called ηasper Χαλκιδική by Hegesandros ( FHG p. 420 fr. 40 ), it is generally assumed that Apollonia could have been founded by the Chalkidians (West ( 1923 ) 49 n. 2 ; Hatzopoulos ( 1994 ) 165 ), when they were given a piece of land near Lake Bolbe in 432 (Thuc. 1 . 58 . 2 )."
546,Arethousa (Arethousios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.4,23.4,582,3040,"546 . Arethousa (Arethousios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 40 , long. 23 . 40 . Size of territory: probably 2 or 3 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Αρέθουσα , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 66 ; Plut. Lyc . 31 . 5 ; IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 16 ( 359 )). The city-ethnic is recorded as Αρεθουacuteσιος αποgrave ΘρΩsubiotaάκης ( Syll . ³ 268 G (C4m) = F.Delphes iii . 1 396 ), and after the Makedonian expansion as ' Ερεθουacuteσιος (probably a misspelling) Μακεδών ( Syll . ³ 269 ( c. 300 ) = F.Delphes iii . 1 186 ( 188 ?)). Arethousa is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 66 (Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ). The political sense is attested in IG ii² 43 . 78 and 83 , where Arethousa under the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε is listed as one of the members of the Second Athenian Naval League. The collective city-ethnic is attested externally in a C4m inventory of crowns donated to Athena in Athens ( IG ii² 1437 . i . 18 ; cf. SEG 28 112 ). The individual city-ethnic is attested externally in a Delphic proxeny decree of C4m ( Syll . ³ 268 G). Arethousa was located in Mygdonia, on the eastern shore of Lake Bolbe (Strabo 7 fr. 36 ; cf. Ps.-Skylax 66 ), which was part of Makedonia in 432 (Thuc. 1 . 58 . 2 ). Arethousa may well have existed in C5 (although no sources confirm that),and if it did, it must have gained independence from Makedonia at some time in the beginning of C4 , for a brief period. Arethousa was a member of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 . 82 ). It seems certain that this was Arethousa in Chalkidike, not the one in Euboia (Dreher ( 1995 ) n. 103 ). Arethousa is recorded in the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi of 360 / 59 ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 16 ). In the cemetery (see infra ) a judicial lead tablet has been found (Moschonisioti et al . ( 1997 )). The tablet dates from c. 300 . There is no doubt that the rather mutilated text concerns judicial matters: the verb καταγράφω ('register, enrol') occurs several times, in Β 4 δικασταgraveς οasperacuteσα έγ &lt; ρ &gt; αφο [ ν ] can be read, and in ∆ 2 τῶ ] ν συνδ [ ικων ( 195 -96 ). The recently excavated remains of an ancient town near modern Rentina have been identified with Arethousa by the excavator (Moschonisioti ( 1992 )). One hundred and twenty-nine graves have been excavated, yielding pottery, jewellery, etc. The graves date from C4m to C2m. Part of a circuit wall was excavated, along with the foundation of a C4l circular tower. There are reports of 'Archaic and Classical finds' from a neighbouring hill, which has been identified with Bormiskos (no. 547 ). However,as the excavator points out (Moschonisioti ( 1992 ) 410 ), it is remarkable to find two towns located within such a short distance (and on the same side of the river), and since there are no Archaic or Classical finds from the hill that has been identified with Arethousa,we may simply suggest (as already in RE s.v.) that Bormiskos and Arethousa are connected; that for some reason the inhabitants of Bormiskos left the settlement and moved to the neighbouring hill."

Bormiskos was located near the Gulf of Strymon,where Lake Bolbe runs into the sea (Thuc. 4 . 103 . 1 ), which (at least in 432 ) was a part of Makedonia (Thuc. 1 . 58 . 2 ). The toponym is Βρο µ ίσκος (Thuc. 4 . 103 . 1 ) or Βορ µ ίσκος ( IG i³ 77 . v . 26 ). Apart from Steph. Byz. 176 . 4 -5 , there is no attestation of the city-ethnic. Thuc. 4 . 103 . 1 mentions that Brasidas stopped at Bormiskos, but he does not give it any site-classification (and Stephanos calls it a chorion at 176 . 1 ). However, Bormiskos was assessed at 1 , 000 dr. in 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . v . 26 ). Furthermore, it may have been recorded in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 (the toponym is restored in IG i³ 71 . iv . 113 ). Consequently, Bormiskos was probably a member of the Delian League, and thus a political community."
548,Chalestre,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.4,22.45,377,1960,"548 . Chalestre Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 40 , long. 22 . 45 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: γ . The toponym is Χαλάστρη (Hecat. fr. 146 ) or Χαλέστρη (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 3 ). Apart from Steph. Byz. 679 . 8 , the city-ethnic is attested only in a very late source: IG x . 2 . 1 815 , a second to third century ad gravestone which in the first line has οasper Χαλεστρ ˜ ε [ ος ] (with dots under all the letters except εσ -). Hecat. fr. 146 calls Chalestre a polis in the urban sense (cf. Hansen ( 1997 b ) 19 ). Hdt. 7 . 123 . 3 locates Chalestre in Mygdonia, in the Thermaic Gulf. Modern Sindos is probably identical with ancient Chalestre (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 197 ). At the site a rich cemetery, containing 121 graves, has been excavated. Although half of the graves had been robbed in Antiquity, the finds were still remarkable. Most of the graves were rectangular pits, but there were also some cists and sarcophagi. In the graves were found weapons and other military equipment, and a large amount of Makedonian jewellery of exceptional quality. Most of the vessels, however, were imported ware from southern Greece. The finds date the cemetery to the period C6m to C5e ( Macedonians 162 with tables 153 -76 ). At the settlement have been found a floor with C8 pottery, mudbrick walls destroyed in C7 , successive building strata dating from C7 to c. 570 (Tiverios ( 1990 )).A gold ring,dating to C5m, is inscribed with the word δῶρον in Ionic script (Panayotou ( 1996 ) 150 n. 39 ). Chalestre is called a polis in the urban sense by Hekataios (fr. 146 ) and Herodotos ( 7 . 123 . 3 ). Hekataios calls it a πόλις Θρηίκων and juxtaposes the town with Therme, which is called a πόλις ' Ελλήνων Θρηίκων . The evidence suggests that it was a Thracian polis in close contact with the Greek world,in which case it should be deleted from this Inventory as a non-Greek polis . Hatzopoulos, however, thinks that Chalestre was probably a mixed settlement (( 1996 a ) 107 )."
549,Herakleia (Herakleotes),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.45,22.4,246,1310,"549 . Herakleia (Herakleotes) Not in Barr . Lat. 40 . 45 , long. 22 . 40 (cf. Gounaropoulou and Hatzopoulos ( 1985 ) 62 -71 ). Size of territory: ? Type: C: α ? The toponym ' Ηράκλεια is known only from late sources ( Demitsas 160 . 10 (Hell. or Roman)). The city-ethnic is ' Ηρακλεώτης ( SEG 27 299 (C4e)), attested at Pella. All sources concerning Herakleia are late (e.g. a second century ad milestone mentioning ηasper πόλις ' Ηρακλεωτῶν ( SEG 35 754 .A 12 -13 )), but the existence of a C4f city-ethnic indicates that the town existed in the Classical period (see Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 176 ), and Steph. Byz. mentions a ' Ηράκλεια Μακεδονίας , Α µ υacuteντου τουtilde Φιλίππου κτίσ µ α ( 304 . 3 ). Herakleia may have been situated on the eastern bank of the river Axios (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 176 ). A burial mound near modern Ag. Athanasios (northwest of Thessaloniki) turned out to be an extended Archaic and Heltic cemetery. It is probably the cemetery of Herakleia (if the site near the river Axios is Herakleia). In the excavated area ten graves were found; eight of them dated to C6 , one to C4s, and one to C3e. The Archaic graves are similar to those found at Sindos and Ag. Paraskevi. Most of the pottery was Corinthian, but an intact Chian chalice was also found (Tsibidou-Auloniti ( 1992 ))."
550,Lete (Letaios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.45,23.0,431,2225,"550 . Lete (Letaios) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 45 ; long. 23 . 00 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: β . The toponym is Λήτη ( SEG 36 331 . 19 ( 323 / 2 ); Steph. Byz. 413 . 19 , possibly quoting Theagenes (C3 ?)) or Λητή (Harp. Λ 19 , quoting Hyp. fr. 87 , Sauppe). The city-ethnic is Ληταῖος ( SEG 24 544 (C4 -C3 )). Lete is called a polis in late sources only ( Syll . ³ 700 (second century ad ); Harp. Λ 19 ), but polis status in the Archaic and Classical periods is indicated by the C6 -C5mint and the Nemean theorodokos ( infra ). The collective city-ethnic is used internally on Archaic coins ( infra ). The individual city-ethnic is used externally on a gravestone from Pella ( SEG 24 544 (C4 -C3 )). In the C4s list of Nemean theorodokoi Lete is placed after the heading Makedonia ( SEG 36 331 . 19 ), but it cannot have become a part of Makedonia proper until after c. 480 , since no city of Makedonia proper minted its own coins until C2 (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 172 ). Lete is recorded in the Nemean list of theorodokoi of 323 / 2 ( SEG 36 331 . 19 ). Lete struck silver coins on the so-called Babylonian standard c. 530 -480 . Denominations: stater, ⅛ stater, and 1½ obols. Types: obv . Silen and nymph; rev . incuse square; legend: sometimes ΛΕΤΑΙΟΝ (Head, HN ² 197 -98 ; Gaebler ( 1935 ) 67 -72 ; SNG Cop. Macedonia 191 -94 ). However, Kraay (( 1976 ) 148 -49 ) does not believe that all the coins attributed to Lete were actually issued by Lete: 'Another important coinage of this area . . . has long passed under the name of 'Lete' , on the strength of a tentative reading of an obscure coin-legend. Lete . . . certainly minted a few coins clearly inscribed with its ethnic, but it is unlikely to have been responsible for the considerable coinage under discussion.' See also Smith ( 2000 ). At the site of ancient Lete two cemeteries have been found, one consisting of four C4l graves and one of twenty C4m-C3e graves (Tsakalou-Tzanavari ( 1989 )). Judging from the onomastic material, Lete probably had a mixed Greco-barbarian population until its conquest by the Makedonians; the considerable influx of Makedonians that followed did not lead to the extinction of the native element (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 211 -13 )."
551,Sindos (Sindonaios?),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.4,22.45,216,1097,"551 . Sindos (Sindonaios?) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 40 , long. 22 . 45 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: β . The toponym is Σίνδος (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 3 ) or Σίνδοι (schol. Ap. Rhod. 4 . 4 . 322 ; Steph. Byz. 569 . 27 ). The corresponding city-ethnic may be Σινδοναῖος (Steph. Byz. 570 . 3 : Σινδοναῖοι , ΘρΩsubiotaάκιον έθνος , ωasperς ' Εκαταῖος εν Ευρώπηsubiotaη = Hecat. fr. 147 ). Sindos is called a polis in the urban sense by Hdt. 7 . 123 . 3 . Hdt. 7 . 123 . 3 locates Sindos in Mygdonia, in the Thermaic Gulf. Hatzopoulos thinks that Sindos was situated at modern Thessaloniki (( 1996 a ) 107 n. 3 ). Papazoglou ( 1988 ) 201 suggests that Sindos was one of the settlements that contributed to the foundation of Thessalonike in 316 / 15 . At modern Thessaloniki-at the so-called Toumbahave been found remains of buildings, built in several phases dating from C10 to C4 (Souereph ( 1990 ), ( 1992 )). The excavations clearly show that there was an important settlement at the site before the foundation of Thessalonike in 316 / 15 . Sindos was probably a mixed settlement (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 107 )."
552,Therme,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.35,22.55,629,3246,"552 . Therme Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 35 , long. 22 . 55 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: β . The toponym is Θέρ µ η , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 124 ). Apart from Steph. Byz. 310 . 1 , there is no attestation of the city-ethnic. Therme is called a polis in the urban sense by Hecat. fr. 146 (cf. Hansen ( 1997 b ) 19 ); Hdt. 7 . 124 ; and Ps.Skylax 66 (cf. Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 151 ). There is no evidence that it was a polis in the political sense as well. Theopomp.fr. 140 seems to have called it a Thracian polisma (cf. Hansen ( 2000 b ) 144 -45 ). Hdt. 7 . 123 . 3 locates Therme in Mygdonia, on the Thermaic Gulf. The exact location of Therme is unknown, although many scholars hold that it was the predecessor of Thessalonike (Vickers ( 1981 ) with refs.), and others that it was situated to the south of it, at Mikro Karabournaki (Borza ( 1990 ) 105 n. 21 ; Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 107 n. 4 ). According to Hdt. 7 . 124 , Therme was a base for the Persian fleet in 480 . In 432 Therme was captured by the Athenians (Thuc. 1 . 61 . 2 ), but it was given back to Perdikkas shortly after (Thuc. 2 . 29 . 6 ). Furthermore, Therme was one of the three places occupied by the pretender to the throne, Pausanias,in 368 (Aeschin. 2 . 27 ). Some Archaic coins attributed by Head, HN ² 203 to Therme (cf. Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 188 n. 196 ) have recently been reattributed to Argilos (Liampi ( 1994 )). Therme is believed by archaeologists to have been located near modern Karabournaki; Rhomaios examined the site in the 1920 s and found C5sherds of Rhodian, Corinthian and Attic pottery, as well as seventeen graves of unknown date (they had been robbed several times) and traces of habitation, also undated, along with prehistoric Makedonian pottery.Rhomaios assumed that the site was inhabited from C8l to C5s ( BCH 54 ( 1930 ) 497 -98 ). More recent investigations have confirmed Rhomaios'findings:remains of a settlement have been found during excavations, and the latest phase seems datable to c. 500 . The pottery, both imported and local, dates from C8 to C5 . Remains of C6l brick and stone walls of houses have been found (Tiverios et al . ( 1994 )). In 1998 the remains of a semi-subterranean dwelling were found; similar buildings have been found in other areas on the fringes of the Greek world,e.g.the Euxine (Tiverios et al . ( 1998 ) 225 ). For the sherds of the Mycenaean period and later, see Tiverios ( 1987 ). About 150 m to the east of the settlement a cemetery has been located,and so far twenty-eight graves dating to C6 -C5 have been excavated (Pandermali and Trakosopoulou ( 1994 )). Therme was called a πόλις ' Ελλήνων Θρηίκων by Hecat. fr. 146 = Steph. Byz. 679 . 5 -6 (cf. Theopomp. fr. 140 : ΘρΩsubiotaάκιον . . . πόλισ µ α ( apud Harp.)), even though it seems to have belonged to Makedonia all the time, except in 432 / 1 . Perhaps it was originally a mixed settlement that was taken over by the Makedonians at an early period (see Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 107 ). Therme is also mentioned by Ps.Skylax 66 , who specifically calls it a polis (on the distinction between polis and polis Hel in Ps.-Skylax, see FlenstedJensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 151 ; for a different interpretation, see Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 473 ). ## 2 .

553,Amphipolis (Amphipolites),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.5,23.5,1495,7059,"553 . Amphipolis (Amphipolites) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 50 , long. 23 . 50 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: α . The toponym is Α µ φίπολις , ηasper (Thuc. 1 . 106 . 4 ; T od 150 . 5 ( 357 )). The city-ethnic is Α µ φιπολίτης (Thuc. 4 . 104 . 1 ; Tod 111 . 20 ( 380 s)). Amphipolis is called a polis both in the urban sense (Thuc. 4 . 102 . 4 ; Isoc. 5 . 2 ; Dem. 12 . 22 ; Aeschin. 2 . 27 -28 ) and in the political sense (Thuc. 4 . 106 . 3 ; Dem. 1 . 5 , 8 ). The urban centre is called polisma at Thuc. 4 . 103 . 5 . The territory of Amphipolis (called chora ) is mentioned at Aeschin. 2 . 27 and Tod 150 . 4 (called ge ). The collective city-ethnic is used internally on C5l coins ( infra ), and in a decree of 357 (Tod 150 . 4 -5 ), and externally in a treaty between the Chalkidians and Amyntas (Tod 111 . 20 ). For the individual and external use, see ' Επισθένης Α µ φιπολίτης , the commander of the peltasts of the Ten Thousand (Xen. An . 1 . 10 . 7 ) and the Athenian C4 honorific decree for an Amphipolitan ( IG ii² 421 . 5 ). The site of Amphipolis was originally an Edonian settlement called ' Εννέα ' Οδοί . In 497 Aristagoras of Miletos tried in vain to settle the place (Thuc. 4 . 102 . 2 ; Diod. 12 . 68 . 3 ), and in 465 the Athenians made another abortive attempt to settle it with 10 , 000 colonists (Thuc. 1 . 100 . 3 , 4 . 102 . 2 ; Diod. 12 . 68 . 2 ; schol. Aeschin. 2 . 34 ). They did not succeed until 437 / 6 , when they founded a colony just south of Ennea Hodoi and called it Amphipolis (Thuc. 4 . 102 . 3 ; Diod. 12 . 68 . 2 ; schol. Aeschin. 2 . 34 ). Hagnon was the oecist. Later Brasidas was celebrated as the oecist of Amphipolis (Thuc. 5 . 11 . 1 , alluded to at Dem. 12 . 21 ; see Malkin ( 1987 ) 228 -32 , ( 1994 ) 136 -37 ). The population of Amphipolis consisted of Greeks from different areas of Greece (Thuc. 4 . 106 . 1 ), among them a group of Argilians (Thuc. 4 . 103 . 3 ) and one of Athenians (Diod. 12 . 32 . 2 ). Apparently some additional Chalkidian settlers ( έποικοι ), led by a certain Kleotimos, caused a stasis and had the majority of the population expelled (Arist. Pol . 1303 b 2 -3 , 1306 a 2 ). This may be connected with the fact that the Chalkidians held Amphipolis c. 363 (Dem. 23 . 149 ; see Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 101 ). Expulsion of Athenians is also mentioned at Dem. 12 . 21 . In 424 Brasidas marched against Amphipolis (Thuc. 4 . 103 ; Diod. 12 . 68 . 3 ); his arrival triggered a stasis between a ruling pro-Athenian faction and an anti-Athenian faction of 'traitors'; Brasidas won the town over by an agreement whereby the pro-Athenian faction was allowed to leave (Thuc. 4 . 103 . 5 -106 . 3 ). For the history of Amphipolis in the 420 s, see Hornblower ( 1996 ) 319 -42 , 435 -57 . Amphipolis was evidently an enemy of Makedonia and the Chalkidians c. 393 (Tod 111 . 19 ). In 370 / 69 the Spartans and other Greeks, along with Amyntas, voted that Amphipolis should be given back to the Athenians (Aeschin. 2 . 32 ), who accordingly sent Iphikrates to Amphipolis in the following year in order to take the city (Aeschin. 2 . 27 ), but he did not succeed. In the following years the Athenians made several attempts to take Amphipolis (see Papastavru ( 1936 ) 24 -31 with refs.). In 360 Philip withdrew the Makedonian garrison placed in Amphipolis by Perdikkas III and left the city autonomos (Diod. 16 . 3 . 3 ). He abandoned his claim to Amphipolis (Diod. 16 . 4 . 1 ), a measure which the Athenians later took to be a promise to restore Amphipolis to them (Dem. 2 . 6 , 23 . 116 ). However, in 357 he laid siege to Amphipolis (Dem. 23 . 116 ) and captured the city (Dem. 12 . 21 ; Diod. 16 . 8 . 2 ). ## 820 flensted -jensen Philon and Stratokles were exiled from Amphipolis in 357 / 6 (Tod 150 = Syll . ³ 194 ). Stratokles is probably the envoy who, along with Hierax (see Theopomp.fr. 42 ), was sent to Athens in 357 to request them to take over Amphipolis (Dem. 1 . 8 ). For the history of Amphipolis 395 -357 , see Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 230 -42 . Being originally an Athenian foundation, Amphipolis probably had a democratic constitution. Thuc. 4 . 104 . 4 mentions a strategos named Eukles who functioned as phylax tou choriou . There is no evidence that the constitution changed after Brasidas' conquest in 424 , although he appointed Klearidas as governor ( archon ) of the city (Thuc. 4 . 132 . 3 ). However,when Kleotimos brought in the Chalkidian settlers, Amphipolis seems to have been ruled by the wealthy ( euporoi ), and in order to obtain tyrannic powers, he attempted a coup d'état (Arist. Pol . 1305 b 40 -1306 a 4 ). Whether or not he succeeded is unknown, but a decree ( psephisma ) of 357 was passed by the demos ( έδοξεν τῶι δή µ ωι ), which points to a democratic constitution (Tod 150 = Syll . ³ 194 ). C4 deeds of sale show that an epistates served as eponymous official ( SEG 41 562 . 8 ), and Tod 150 . 17 ( 357 ) refers to a board of prostatai . For constitution and officials, see also Papastavru ( 1936 ) 47 -50 . A priest of Asklepios is mentioned in several C4m deeds of sale (Hatzopoulos ( 1991 ) = SEG 41 555 -66 ). A man from Amphipolis was granted proxenia at Kos in C4l ( Iscr. Cos ED 190 ). Amphipolis is recorded in the Epidaurian catalogue of theorodokoi of 360 / 59 ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 18 ) as well as in the Nemean of 323 / 2 ( SEG 36 331 B. 17 ). The urban centre of Amphipolis has been excavated, but, apart from the fortifications, most of the remains are Heltic or later (D. Lazaridis ( 1993 )). Thucydides mentions the agora ( 5 . 11 . 1 ) and the city wall of Amphipolis ( 4 . 102 . 4 , 104 . 1 ), along with the gates ( 4 . 104 . 4 ). There were houses in the proasteion (Thuc. 4 . 103 . 5 ; Diod. 12 . 68 . 1 ). The city walls have been excavated. They are built in isodomic or pseudo-isodomic masonry and stand to a height of 7 . 25 m in some places ( AAA 8 . 1 ( 1975 ) 56 -76 ). The circumference of the city wall is 7 , 450 m, and that of the acropolis 2 , 220 m (Lorber ( 1990 ) 9 ; cf. D. Lazaridis ( 1993 ) 24 -52 ). The city wall encloses an area of 250 ha, the acropolis wall an area of 37 ha. The gymnasion of Amphipolis goes back to C4 (K. Lazaridis ( 1988 ), ( 1989 )). There was a monument to Rhesos and a temple for his mother Kleio at Amphipolis (Marsyas, FGH 135 fr. 7 ; see Malkin ( 1987 ) 81 -84 ). A temple of Athena is mentioned by Thuc. 5 . 10 . 2 . A temple of Apollo and Strymon is recorded in Syll . ³ 194 . 15 . Lorber surveys the archaeological remains (( 1990 ) 7 -11 ) and the cults of Amphipolis (ibid. 11 -14 ). Amphipolis struck silver coins on the Phoenician standard (and rare gold coins on the Attic, c. 400 ) from c. 413 to c. 357 (Gaebler ( 1935 ) 30 ff; Head, HN ² 214 ff; SNG Cop. Macedonia 37 -41 ) or from 370 to 354 (Lorber ( 1990 ) 107 ). Denominations: tetradrachms, drachms, hemidrachms, tetrobols, triobols and obols. Types: obv . head of Apollo; rev . race-torch in a raised frame; legend: ΑΜΦΙΠΟΛΙΤΕΩΝ or ΑΜΦΙΠΟΛΙΤΩΝ (rare). Amphipolis struck bronze coins as well ( SNG Cop. Macedonia 42 -49 )."
554,Argilos (Argilios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.45,23.5,1062,5008,"554 . Argilos (Argilios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 45 , long. 23 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Αacuteργιλος (Hdt. 7 . 115 . 1 ) or Αacuteρκιλος ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 17 ( 359 )). The city-ethnic is Αργίλιος ( IG i³ 270 . iii . 21 ) or Αρκί ( λιος ) (C5e-C4 coins, infra ). Argilos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 7 . 115 . 1 ; Thuc. 4 . 103 . 4 ) and in the political sense (Thuc. 4 . 103 . 4 , 5 . 18 . 5 : Peace of Nikias). The collective use of the cityethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on C5e-C4 coins ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 56 ). For the individual and external use, see Thuc. 1 . 132 . 5 (r 467 ). In C5 Argilos was considered a colony of Andros (Thuc. 4 . 103 . 3 ). The existence of Argilos is not attested in written sources prior to 480 , but if it was an Andrian colony, it may have been founded in C7 , since it is generally assumed that Andros established its colonies c. 655 (Lauffer ( 1989 ) 114 , probably on the basis of Eusebius,who gives 655 as the foundation year of Akanthos and Stagiros, Chron . 95 b). According to Hdt. 7 . 115 . 1 , Argilos was located in Bisaltia. In the territory of Argilos, across the river from Amphipolis, was a place called Kerdylion (Thuc. 5 . 6 . 3 ). A site in the vicinity of Nea Kerdyllia has been identified with this Kerdylion. Here a section of a Classical circuit wall has been found along with a gate ( ArchDelt 41 ( 1986 ) Chron . 177 -78 ). At Vrasna, also in the territory of Argilos, a fivesided phrourion with towers has been excavated. The phrourion dates to C4 (one coin of Philip II was found inside it), and its perimeter was c. 70 m (Adam-Veleni ( 1992 )). Argilos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 22 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 9 ) a total of twelve times. In 454 / 3 it paid the enormous sum of 10½ tal. ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 22 ). Some scholars find it unbelievable that Argilos could have paid that much and want to correct the amount to 1½ tal. (Lewis in IG i³ ), while others think that the amount can be explained (Isaac ( 1986 ) 53 -54 ). From 446 / 5 ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 30 ) to 438 / 7 ( IG i³ 274 . vi . 15 ) Argilos paid 1 tal., and after that 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 54 ). Argilos is absent from the full panel of 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . ii . 37 -67 ), which may mean that it took part in the revolt of 432 , but it is listed in 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 24 ) and 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 9 ). It was probably assessed in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 177 : [ Αρ ] γί [ λιοι ]). Argilos followed Brasidas (Thuc. 4 . 103 . 4 ), along with the two other Andrian colonies in the area ( sc . Akanthos (no. 559 ) and Stagiros (no. 613 ); Sane (no. 600 ), the fourth Andrian colony, remained a loyal member of the Delian League).In the Peace of Nikias it is stipulated that Argilos be autonomos and liable to the tribute assessed by Aristeides (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 5 ). Argilos is recorded in the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi of c. 359 ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 17 ). There was an Aristotelian politeia of the Argilians (no. 23 = Heracl. Lemb. 75 ). A C4 deed of sale shows that an epistates served as eponymous official (Hatzopoulos ( 1991 ) 14 -19 = SEG 24 583 . 1 -2 , supposedly from Argilos: Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 192 ). Apparently a group of Argilians resided in Amphipolis and acquired citizenship there (Thuc. 4 . 103 . 4 ). Thucydides uses the verb ε µ πολιτευacuteω about them, but it is uncertain whether this means that they had retained their civil rights in Argilos or whether they had lost their citizenship in Argilos when they settled in Amphipolis (Hornblower ( 1996 ) 329 ). Argilos was situated on a hill about 4 km west of the Strymon estuary. On the southern side of the hill there were houses, of which the earliest date from C6m, and on the eastern side a cemetery. Parts of the city wall have been found near the coast. The earliest finds are sherds dated to C7m. According to the excavators, the city flourished in C6 -C5 , but it lost some of its territory to Amphipolis when that city was founded in 437 , and Argilos had ceased to exist by C3 . They also claim that Argilos was destroyed by Philip and that only the acropolis was inhabited after that. A large square building of the Heltic period may be the seat of some member of the royal Makedonian retinue (Bonias and Perrault ( 1996 )). East of the settlement three graves have been found, dating from C4l/C3e. Some late Archaic coins, formerly attributed to Therme (Head, HN ² 203 ), have recently been attributed to Argilos (Liampi ( 1994 )). Argilos struck silver coins in C5e and bronze coins in C4 .

The toponym is Τράϊλος ( IG i³ 77 . v . 25 ) or Τράγιλα ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 20 ( 359 )) or, later, Τράγιλος (Steph. Byz. 630 . 11 ); see Masson ( 1995 ). The cityethnic is Τραγίλιος ( Syll . ³ 239 B. 35 ( 364 / 3 )) or, on C5 coins, Τραίλιος ( infra ). The only source in which Traïlos is called a polis is Steph. Byz. 630 . 11 , but polis status in the Archaic and Classical periods is indicated by membership of the Delian League, the C5 -C4mint, and the appointment of a theorodokos in C4m ( infra ). The collective city-ethnic is used internally on coins ( infra ). The external individual use of the city-ethnic is found in CID ii 4 . i . 35 ( 360 ). Traïlos was the home town of the C4mythographer Asklepiades (( FGrHist 12 ) T 1 = Steph. Byz. 630 . 12 -13 ). Traïlos has been identified with the site at modern Aidonichori, c. 12 km north-west of Amphipolis.A C6l-C4m cemetery has been found, along with a large C4s-C3e building (Nikolaïdou-Patera ( 1989 ), ( 1990 )). See also Isaac (( 1986 ) 5 -6 ), who summarises the result of the excavations carried out in 1971 , and Koukouli-Chrysanthaki ( 1983 ). Traïlos may have been a member of the Delian League. It was assessed at 1 tal. in 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . v . 25 ), but it may also have been assessed in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iv . 112 -the toponym is restored, but the amount ( 1 tal.) is legible). Traïlos is recorded in the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi of 360 / 59 ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 20 ). Traïlos struck silver coins on the Phoenician standard in C5 and bronze coins in C4f. Denomination: hemiobol. Types: obv . corn-ear, or bunch of grapes, or head of Hermes; rev . incuse square with ΤΡΑΙ , or ΤΡΑΙΛΙΟΝ around a rose (Head, HN ² 217 ; Gaebler ( 1935 ) 131 -32 ; Robinson and Clement ( 1938 ); SNG Cop. Macedonia 445 -53 ). The onomastic material from Traïlos does not support the view that it was originally a barbarian town (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 214 , pace , e.g., Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 121 n. 5 ). ## 3 .

The toponym is Αιγή (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is Αιγάντιος ( IG i³ 269 . iii . 5 ). The only source in which Aige is explicitly called a polis is Steph. Byz. 38 . 9 -39 . 1 ; but at 7 . 123 . 1 Herodotos uses the pronoun αυaspertildeται about Aige and seven other poleis on Pallene, and it is an almost certain inference that the noun to be supplied is πόλεις . The collective city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 269 . iii . 5 ). Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 locates Aige on Pallene, between Neapolis and Therambos.According to Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 , Xerxes received ships and troops from Aige in 480 , which indicates that it may have been a polis at that time. Aige was probably one of Poteidaia's allies when that city fought against the Persians in 479 (Hdt. 8 . 128 ). Aige was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 17 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . iii . 9 ) a total of eighteen times, paying either 2 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 17 ) or 3 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 262 . i . 6 ). After C5 Aige is not heard of. It is possible that it was absorbed by one of its larger neighbours."
557,Aineia (Aineiates),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.3,22.5,733,3449,"557 . Aineia (Aineiates) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 30 , long. 22 . 50 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Αίνεια (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 ) or Αίνεα (Perlman ( 2000 ) 177 -78 , E. 1 b. 10 ( 360 / 59 )). The city-ethnic is Αινιάτης ( IG i³ 262 . iv . 12 ) or Αινεάτης ( IG i³ 278 . v . 18 ), or Αινειάτης ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 20 ), all attested in the Athenian tribute lists. On C5l/C4f coins the variants ΑΙΝΕΙΑΤΩΝ , ΑΙΝΕΗΤΩΝ and ΑΙΝΕΗΤΩΝ are found (Gaebler ( 1935 ) 22 ). Aineia is called a &lt;polis&gt; Hel in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 66 (cf. Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ). Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 -3 calls it a polis mainly in the urban, but probably also in the political sense (cf. Hansen ( 2000 a ) 175 -76 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins of C4 (Gaebler ( 1935 ) 22 ), and externally on the Athenian tribute lists (e.g. IG i³ 278 . v . 18 ). According to Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 , Aineia was a polis in Krousis which in 480 provided Xerxes with troops. Aineia was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is registered in the tribute lists from 451 / 50 ( IG i³ 262 . iv . 12 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 24 ) a total of sixteen times, once completely restored, paying 3 tal. ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 34 ) until 430 / 29 , when the tribute was lowered to 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 20 ). Aineia is recorded in the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi of 360 / 59 (Perlman ( 2000 ) 177 -78 , E. 1 b. 10 ). Aineia existed down to the time of Kassandros, when it was destroyed together with twenty-five other settlements, all synoecised into Thessalonike (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 1 . 49 . 4 ; Strabo 7 frr. 21 , 24 ). Livy, however, mentions Aineia three times in a C2 context ( 40 . 4 . 9 ; 45 . 27 . 4 , 30 . 4 ), and it is recorded in the list of Delphic theorodokoi of 230 -220 ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) 18 , iii . 75 ). The urban centre of Aineia must have been at modern Nea Michaniona, where there are abundant sherds and other remains of C5 -C4 (Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 143 ). A rescue excavation has revealed twenty graves, all except one dating to C4l, the exception being a C5 burial; between 1979 and 1982 three burial mounds were excavated; they belong to a wellknown cemetery of the Archaic and Classical periods (Tsigarida ( 1994 )). Aineia struck silver coins on the Euboic standard from C6l to c. 424 , and on the Phoenician standard from c. 424 to c. 350 . Denominations: tetradrachms, tetrobols and diobols. Types: obv . Aineias, Anchises, Kreusa and Askanios; legend: ΑΙΝΕΑΣ ; rev . incuse square. Later coins have obv . head of Athena, or head of Aineias; rev . bull; legend: ΑΙΝΕΑΣ or ΑΙΝΕ ( Ι ) ΑΤΩΝ , or ΑΙΝΕΗΤΩΝ . In C4f Aineia struck bronze coins with the same types and legends (Head, HN ² 214 ; Gaebler ( 1935 ) 20 -22 ; SNG Cop. Macedonia 33 -35 ). Aineia was said to have been founded by Aineias. C6l coins depict Aineias carrying Anchises on his shoulders, behind Kreusa, who carries a small girl on her shoulders (Gaebler ( 1935 ) 20 ; cf. Kraay ( 1976 ) 134 with no. 469 ). The legend on the coin is, remarkably, ΑΙΝΕΑΣ , interpreted as the name of the city Aineia in the genitive (Gaebler ( 1935 ) 21 ), although it could also be the name Aineias in the nominative. Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom. 1 . 47 . 6 , 48 . 1 , 49 . 4 also credits Aineias with the foundation of Aineia, and he evidently has this piece of information from Hellanikos ( FGrHist 4 ) fr. 31 ."

' s recording of Aioleion south of Spartolos (no. 612 ) and north of Pleume (no. 595 ) is just a guess; see Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 145 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: α ? The toponym is h αιόλειον ( IG i³ 76 . 53 ( c. 422 ) = Tod 68 ; restored: h αιό [ λειον ]-though h αιο [ λῖται ] is equally possible) or Αιόλειον (Theopomp. fr. 144 , apud Steph. Byz. 53 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is Αιολίτης ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 7 ). Aioleion is listed after the heading αιasperacuteδε πόλες in a treaty of c. 422 ( IG i³ 76 . 44 , 53 ), and in the Athenian tribute lists the city-ethnic occurs twice after the heading πόλεις αυταιgrave φόρον ταξά µ εναι ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 5 -7 , 279 . ii . 76 -77 and 84 ) and once after the heading ταῖσδε ( sc . πόλεσιν ) έταξαν οιasper τάκται ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 34 -36 , 42 ); in all four cases polis is used in the political sense. At Theopomp. fr. 144 Aioleion is attested as a polis in the political and urban senses simultaneously. The collective city-ethnic is used externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 7 ). Aioleion was a Bottiaian polis (Flensted-Jensen ( 1995 ) 117 -18 ), but its exact location is unknown. C. 422 the Bottiaians entered into an alliance with the Athenians (Tod 68 = IG i³ 76 ). The same inscription seems to show that the Bottiaians had formed a confederacy at that time (Flensted- Jensen ( 1995 ) 126 -28 ). If they did, Aioleion must have been one of the members (cf. IG i³ 76 . 53 ). Aioleion was a member of the Delian League, and it is recorded in the tribute lists three times, in 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 7 ), 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 84 ) and 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 42 ), paying 500 dr. in all three years. It is absent from the full panel of 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . ii . 37 -67 ) but was assessed for tribute in 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . v . 17 ) ( 500 dr.). In C4 Aioleion may have been a member of the Chalkidian Federation (FlenstedJensen ( 1995 ) 117 )."
559,Akanthos (Akanthios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.25,23.5,1466,7381,"559 . Akanthos (Akanthios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 25 , long. 23 . 50 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Αacuteκανθος , ηasper (Thuc. 4 . 114 . 3 ; IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 22 ( 360 / 59 )). The city-ethnic is Ακάνθιος (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 11 ; IG i³ 266 . ii . 29 ). Akanthos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Ps.-Skylax 66 ; cf. Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ) and in the political sense (Thuc. 4 . 85 . 6 , 5 . 18 . 5 : Peace of Nikias). At Thuc. 5 . 18 . 6 : Peace of Nikias, the territorial sense is a connotation, and at Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 11 polis is used in the urban and political senses combined (Hansen ( 2000 a ) 210 ). The collective city-ethnic is used internally on C5 coins ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 29 ). The individual cityethnic is used externally by Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 12 . Patris is found in Amphis fr. 36 , KA. Munro ( 1896 ) 313 describes a fragment of an undated inscription which is probably a boundary stone; only ΟΡ ∆Η ΑΚ is left; it could be restored οasperacuteρος δή µ ου Ακάνθιων , paceCIG add. 2007 k,where it is interpreted οasperacuteρος ∆ή µ ητρος Ακανθίας . Akanthos may have been a colony of Andros (Thuc. 4 . 84 . 1 ; Strabo 7 fr. 31 ; Ps.-Skymnos 647 ), probably founded in C7e (Panayotou ( 1991 ) 127 ). Although one C5e graffito found at Akanthos was inscribed in the Andrian alphabet ( SEG 36 580 ), a preliminary examination of the grave material from Akanthos does not in itself indicate that Akanthos was an Andrian colony (H. Trakosopoulou per litt. ). The first time Akanthos is mentioned in a literary source is in connection with Xerxes' march in 480 ; from Hdt. 7 . 116 it appears that Akanthos entertained Xerxes and his army in 480 . Herodotos does not call Akanthos a polis , but Xerxes declared that there existed xenia between Akanthos and himself, which indicates status as a political unit. Akanthos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 34 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 13 ) a total of eleven times, paying 5 tal. in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 34 ) (amount not implausibly restored) and thereafter 3 tal. ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 29 ). In 424 Brasidas made an expedition against Akanthos (Thuc. 4 . 84 ). His arrival triggered a stasis between two opposing factions: Chalkidian supporters of Brasidas and the demos (Thuc. 4 . 84 . 2 ). The Akanthians voted to revolt against the Athenians and make a treaty with Brasidas (Thuc. 4 . 88 . 1 ; cf. Syll . ³ 79 ). According to Diod. 12 . 67 . 2 , Akanthos was the first town that Brasidas persuaded to break away from Athens. In 423 Akanthos sent troops into Lynkestis with Brasidas (Thuc. 4 . 123 . 1 ). In the Peace of Nikias it is stipulated that Akanthos be autonomos and pay the tribute as fixed by Aristeides (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 5 ). The Akanthians were enemies of the Chalkidians in the 380 s, according to the second of the treaties between Amyntas III and the Chalkidians ( Syll . ³ 135 ; Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 122 ff). That Akanthos was not a member of the Chalkidian Federation is also clear from Xenophon's description at Hell . 5 . 2 . 11 of how in 382 Akanthos sent envoys to Sparta to obtain aid from Sparta in order to avoid being incorporated into the expanding Chalkidian Federation. It is highly probable that Ass(er)a (no. 564 ), Akanthos' nearest neighbour to the west, was now a member of the Chalkidian Federation (see infra ). Apparently, Akanthos was a not unimportant town in 382 : Xenophon calls Akanthos and Apollonia 'the largest of the poleis around Olynthos' , and emphasises that the Akanthians still had their patrioi nomoi and called themselves autopolitai ( Hell . 5 . 2 . 14 ). About 349 Akanthos sent envoys to Athens to ask for help against Philip ( IG ii² 210 + 259 ; Schweigert ( 1937 ) 329 -32 ). Akanthos was not one of the poleis in the Chalkidic peninsula destroyed by Philip. Not only does it appear on the C3l Delphic list of theorodokoi ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 86 ), but it is also mentioned by Livy ( 31 . 45 . 16 (r 200 )), and the cemetery at Akanthos was in use continuously from the Archaic through to the Roman period. Since the treaty with Brasidas in 424 was decided by a secret vote (Thuc. 4 . 88 . 1 ) taken among the plethos (Thuc. 4 . 84 . 2 ), Akanthos probably had a democratic constitution, at least at the time of the Peloponnesian War (Grayson ( 1972 ) 64 ). Akanthos is recorded in the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi in 360 / 59 ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 22 ). The Akanthians had a treasury in Delphi erected in C6 and rebuilt in 423 ( Syll . ³ 79 ; Plut. Lys . 1 . 1 ; Bommelaer ( 1991 ) no. 303 ). The acropolis of Akanthos was situated on a hill overlooking the sea and the cemetery, which was situated near the coast. The site is partly covered by modern Ierissos. On the acropolis not much has been found: there are remains of walls believed to be the walls surrounding the acropolis. They were built in two phases; the oldest part is on the east side of the hill. A stretch of c. 30 m, c. 8 m in height, has been found. The next phase is either late Classical or early Heltic. On the south part of the hill there are remains of a square tower or possibly a gate (Trakosopoulou-Salakidou ( 1996 ) 299 -300 ). On top of the hill are the remains of a temple, which is contemporary with the oldest part of the wall, i.e. probably early Classical (ibid. 301 -2 ). Remains of one other, early Heltic, building have been found: the quality and decoration of the building suggest that it may have been a prytaneion ( ArchDelt 39 ( 1984 ) Chron . 223 ). The cemetery has hitherto yielded more than 9 , 000 graves, covering the period C7l to the third century ad . The majority of the graves are from the Classical period (TrakosopoulouSalakidou ( 1996 ) 297 ff). In 1998 some 400 graves which had been uncovered in 1979 werepublished (Kaltsas ( 1998 )). The area covered by the cemetery is estimated to be at least 60 km ² . The earliest pottery is C7l Ionian pottery along with pottery from Aiolis and the islands along the coast of Asia Minor. From C6m Attic pottery is the most common type, Corinthian the second most common. Of interest are three sherds from Panathenaic amphoras, showing that Akanthians had participated in and been victorious in the Panathenaic Games. Furthermore, a C5 bronze strigil inscribed with ∆ΕΜΟΣΙΗ has been found. It has been suggested that the strigil 'belonged to the city of Akanthos, and had probably been registered in the gymnasium under the number five'( Macedonians ( 1994 ) 76 pl. 9 ). Akanthos struck silver coins on the Euboic standard from c. 500 (or perhaps already from c. 530 ; see Desneux ( 1949 )) to c. 424 and on the Phoenician standard from c. 424 to c. 350 . Denominations: tetradrachms, tetrobols, triobols, diobols and obols.

The city-ethnic is Ακρόθωιος ( IG i³ 77 . v . 33 -34 ) or Ακροθώτης (Ps.-Skylax 66 ). Hdt. 7 . 22 . 3 and Ps.-Skylax 66 (cf. Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ) call Akrothooi a polis in the urban sense, whereas Thuc. 4 . 109 . 3 -5 probably uses polis in the political sense, using polisma about the settlement. The collective use of the cityethnic is attested internally in a C2 proxeny decree passed by the Akrothonians' boule and demos ( SEG 46 710 ) and externally in the Athenian assessment decree of 422 ( infra ). Akrothooi was located on Athos (Hdt. 7 . 22 . 3 ; Thuc. 4 . 109 . 3 ). It was probably a member of the Delian League, because it revolted from Athens and joined Brasidas in 423 (Thuc. 4 . 109 . 4 ), but it never occurs in the tribute lists, only in the assessment decree of 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . v . 33 -34 ). Strabo ( 7 frr. 33 , 35 ) says that the five poleis on Athos were settled by Pelasgians from Lemnos. According to Thuc. 4 . 109 . 3 -4 , Akrothooi had a mixed (i.e. barbarian-Hellenic) bilingual population, but about a century later it is called a &lt;polis&gt; Hel by Ps.-Skylax 66 (Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 151 )."

The toponym is Ανθε µ ουtildeς (Aeschin. 2 . 27 ), οasper (Thuc. 2 . 99 . 6 ) or ηasper (Dem. 6 . 20 ). The city-ethnic is Ανθε µ ουacuteντιος (Harp. Α 143 ) or Ανθε µ ουacuteσιος (Steph. Byz. 96 . 8 ; cf. Arr. Anab . 2 . 9 . 3 ). Anthemous is classified as a polis in late lexicographers only: viz . Harp. Α 143 ; Steph. Byz. 96 . 7 ; Suda Α 2491 ; and Hsch. Α 5118 . But in Aeschin. 2 . 27 Anthemous is juxtaposed with Therme and Strepsa, both of which were poleis : ειληφότος δεgrave Ανθε µ ουtildeντα καιgrave Θέρ µ αν καιgrave Στρέψαν καιgrave άλλ ' άττα χωρία ( sc . Παυσανίου ). For chorion used about a polis , see Hansen ( 1995 ) 44 n. 167 . Thus, on analogy with Therme and Strepsa, Anthemous may have been a Classical polis . Hatzopoulos and Loukopoulou ( 1987 ) 59 n. 155 locate Anthemous near the church of Ag. Paraskevi 3 . 5 km to the south of modern Galatista (cf. Wace ( 1913 -14 ); Edson ( 1955 ) 171 -72 ). At the site near Galatista a number of late inscriptions (the earliest being from c. 180 ) have been found,among them two decrees and an ephebic list (Hatzopoulos and Loukopoulou ( 1987 ) 34 -67 ). Hdt. 5 . 94 . 1 and Thuc. 2 . 99 . 6 , 100 . 4 both know Anthemous, but clearly as a district of Makedonia. From Aeschin. 2 . 27 ( χωρίον ) it appears that Anthemous was an urban centre (or perhaps a fortress). In C4 Anthemous was fought over by the Makedonians and the Chalkidians, and belonged to the Chalkidians at least once (Dem. 6 . 20 ; Diod. 14 . 92 . 3 (r 393 ), 15 . 19 . 2 (r 383 )). Anthemous provided Alexander with an ile (Arr. Anab . 2 . 9 . 3 ). The sources seem to indicate that Anthemous was originally a district which belonged to the Makedonian king, and that the town Anthemous emerged during C4 ."
563,Aphytis (Aphytaios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.05,23.3,1161,5460,"563 . Aphytis (Aphytaios) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 05 , long. 23 . 30 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Αacuteφυτις , ηasper ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 24 ( 360 / 59 ); Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 19 ; Paus. 3 . 18 . 3 ), gen. ιος (Thuc. 1 . 64 . 2 ), -εως (Theopomp. fr. 141 ). Steph. Byz. ( 151 . 1 ) gives Αφυacuteτη ηgrave Αacuteφυτις ηgrave Αacuteφυτος . The cityethnic is Αφυταῖος ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 10 ). In Ps.-Skylax 66 Aphytis is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε εν τηsubiotaηtilde Παλλήνηsubiotaη ' Ελληνίδες , where polis is used in the urban sense. At 7 . 123 . 1 Herodotos uses the pronoun αυaspertildeται about Aphytis and seven other poleis on Pallene, and it is an almost certain inference that the noun to be supplied is πόλεις . For polis in the political sense, see Arist. Pol . 1319 a 10 and 14 , where Aphytis is listed as one of two examples after the heading εν πολλαῖς πόλεσι νενο µ οθετη µ ένον . The collective city-ethnic is used externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 10 ), and internally on coins ( infra ). For the individual and external use of the city-ethnic, see IG i³ 1032 . vi . 83 , 99 . According to Hdt. 7 . 123 , Aphytis was located on Pallene between Poteidaia and Neapolis (cf.Thuc. 1 . 64 . 2 ; Strabo 7 fr. 27 ), i.e. at modern Athytos. Arist. Pol . 1319 a 15 -16 states that the Aphytaians had a small territory even though the population was large. Aphytis supplied Xerxes with troops and ships in 480 , which indicates that at that time it was a polis in the political sense (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 ). Aphytis was a member of the Delian League and seems to have been a loyal member for the whole period: it belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . i . 2 ); it is present in the full panel of 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 10 ) and also appears on the last list of 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . iii . 5 ). It appears a total of sixteen times, once completely restored, paying 3 tal. from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . i . 2 ) to 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 24 ), 1 tal. from 446 / 5 ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 22 ) to 440 / 39 ( IG i³ 272 . i . 47 ), and 3 tal. again from 435 / 4 ( IG i³ 277 . v . 14 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 11 ). It was assessed in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 168 ). In an area of general rebellion, Aphytis remained a loyal Athenian ally: it served as an Athenian base in 432 (Thuc. 1 . 64 . 2 ), and it was also rewarded for its loyalty: an Athenian decree ( IG i³ 62 ( c. 428 / 7 )) granted Aphytis the privilege of importing a certain amount of grain. It appears from the inscription that there were (Athenian?) archontes in Aphytis (Meritt ( 1944 ) 211 -29 ), and that envoys were sent from Aphytis to Athens c. 428 ( IG i³ 63 . 8 ). Aphytis was besieged, but not conquered, by Lysander in 405 / 4 (Paus. 3 . 18 . 3 ). The continued importance of Aphytis is apparent from the fact that it is recorded in the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 24 ( 360 / 59 )). Aphytis was probably synoecised into Kassandreia (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 121 , 199 -200 , 255 ). There was an Aristotelian politeia of the Aphytaians (no. 29 = Heracl. Lemb. 72 ). There was a census requirement for citizenship in C4s, but it was so low that it was passed even by the poor (Arist. Pol . 1319 a 14 -19 ). There was a temple of Dionysos at Aphytis (Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 19 ), and according to Paus. 3 . 18 . 3 the Aphytaians worshipped Ammon, whose head adorns their coins ( infra ). Excavations have revealed the ruins of a C4s temple, presumably of Zeus Ammon ( AAA 4 ( 1971 ) 356 -67 ; BCH 96 ( 1972 ) 730 , 736 ). Furthermore, south of the temple was found a sanctuary of Dionysos (an inscribed C5sherd reads ∆ι ] ονυσο ( SEG 30 586 )) and the Nymphs,inside which were sherds from C8s onwards. For the archaeological remains at modern Athytos,dating from C8s to the Classical period, see ArchDelt 32 ( 1977 ) Chron . 202 ; ArchDelt 34 ( 1979 ) Chron . 279 . Parts of a defence wall from the Classical period have been found ( ArchDelt 32 ( 1977 ) Chron . 202 with photo). Inside the sanctuary of Dionysos were found C8s pottery, which indicates that Aphytis was founded in C8s ( AAA 4 ( 1971 ) 356 -77 ). At Nea Kallithea, 3 km south of Athytos, have been found sherds etc., probably from the Classical period ( ArchDelt 24 ( 1969 ) Chron . 312 ). Twenty-one graves dating from C6m-C5l have been found at Aphytis (Misaïlidou-Despotidou ( 2001 )). Aphytis struck coins on the Phoenician standard from C5m (Gaebler ( 1935 ) 44 -46 ; Robinson and Clement ( 1938 ) 273 ), or from c. 424 ( ArchDelt 41 ( 1986 ) Chron . 148 ) to C4m. Head, however, does not believe that Aphytis struck coins while a member of the Delian League, and dates all coins of Aphytis to the period before 358 ( HN ² 209 -10 ). ( 1 ) Silver, C5 : denomination: tetrobols. Types: obv . head of Zeus Ammon, or Ares helmeted; rev . kantharos, or eagle(s), or linear square with vine; legend: ΑΦΥ or ΑΦΥΤΑΙΟΝ . ( 2 ) Bronze, C4f.

According to Theopomp. fr. 141 ( apud Steph. Byz. 698 . 15 ), Aphytis founded a place called Chytropolis.Stephanos calls it a chorion . Its location is unknown, but Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 254 suggests that it may have been located in the territory of Aphytis."
564,Ass(er)a (Asserites),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.2,23.5,521,2688,"564 . Ass(er)a (Asserites) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 20 , long. 23 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Αacuteσσα (Hdt. 7 . 122 ), or Αacuteσσηρα , τά (Theopomp. fr. 147 apud Steph. Byz. 136 . 1 ). Stephanos Byzantios has two entries: ' Ασσα , πόλις προgraveς τΩsubiotaῶ ΑacuteθΩsubiotaω . ' Ηρόδοτος εasperβδό µ ηsubiotaη ( 135 . 18 ) and Αacuteσσηρα , ουδετέρως , πόλις Χαλκιδπεων , Θεόπο µ πος εικοστηsubiotaηtilde τετάρτηsubiotaη ( 136 . 1 ). Either Assa and Assera are two different places, or Stephanos did not know that Herodotos and Theopompos referred to the same place. The city-ethnic is either h ασσερίτης or Ασσερίτης , both recorded in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 26 and IG i³ 270 . iii . 16 ). At Hdt. 7 . 122 Ass(er)a is twice called a polis , first in the urban sense, but the information that Ass(er)a was one of the poleis which supplied Xerxes with troops in 480 indicates that polis is used in the political sense as well. Furthermore, he locates Ass(er)a in the bay of Singos; cf. Steph. Byz. 135 . 18 : πόλις προgraveς τΩsubiotaῶ ΑacuteθΩsubiotaω . The territory of Ass(er)a, Ασσηρῖτις (some MSS have Ασσυρῖτις ) is mentioned by Arist. Hist. an . 519 a 15 . He says that a river named Ψυχρός ran through the territory, and that the territory was situated εν τηsubiotaηtilde Χαλκιδικηtilde ; cf. Steph. Byz. 136 . 1 , who calls Ass(er)a a πόλις Χαλκιδέων , perhaps quoting Theopompos fr. 147 . The collective city-ethnic is used externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 26 ). Scholars seem to agree that the inhabitants of Ass(er)a were the Asseritans known from the Athenian tribute lists (e.g. Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 163 ). The Asseritans were members of the Delian League: they belonged to the Thracian district and are recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . v . 7 -8 ) to 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 72 ) a total of fourteen times. In the first year they paid together with the Olynthians (no. 588 ) and the Skablaians (no. 607 ). Thereafter they paid separately. They paid 2 , 400 dr. ( IG i³ 262 . iii . 22 ) until 438 / 7 , when they paid 3 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 274 . vi . 14 ). Since the Asseritans are not recorded in the tribute lists after 432 / 1 , it may be inferred that they participated in the Revolt of 432 , along with several other towns in the area (Thuc. 1 . 58 ). It is not known whether Ass(er)a was also a member of the Chalkidian Federation, but its location, and the fact that Aristotle says that its territory lay εν τηsubiotaηtilde Χαλκιδικηsubiotaηtilde ( supra ), and that Theopompos probably called it πόλις Χαλκιδέων ( supra ), suggest membership of the Chalkidian Federation."
565,Charadrous,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,62,340,"565 . Charadrous Map 51 . Unlocated. Type: A: β ? The toponym is Χαραδρουtildeς (Ps.-Skylax 66 ). Charadrous is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 66 (Flensted- Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ), who lists Charadrous between Akrothooi (no. 560 ) and Olophyxos (no. 587 ) on Akte. Charadrous is not mentioned in any other source."
566,(Chedrolioi),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,306,1324,"566 . (Chedrolioi) Map 50 . Unlocated. Type: [A]: α ? The toponym is not attested, unless the restoration suggested by Hatzopoulos and Loukopoulou ( 1992 ) 126 -27 is correct ( SEG 40 542 , comm. to ll. 9 -10 ), pace Vokotopoulou ( 1996 ) 215 ). They suggest that Γ [ έδ ] ρωλον is a 'forme macédonienne de Χέδρωλον ' (cf. Hatzopoulos ( 1987 ) on the development of χ = γ in Makedonia). The city-ethnic is h εδρόλιος ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 3 ) or Χεδρόλιος ( IG i³ 277 . vi . 25 ). In 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 5 -6 , 16 , completely restored) and 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 76 -77 , 88 ) the Chedrolians are recorded under the heading πόλες αυταιgrave ταχσά µ εναι . The Chedrolians were members of the Delian League. They belonged to the Thracian district and are recorded in the tribute lists for the first time in 448 / 7 ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 3 ), then in 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 33 ), 435 / 4 ( IG i³ 277 . vi . 25 , as άτακτοι 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 16 ), and the last time in 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 88 ), paying first 500 and later 1 , 000 dr. Since the Chedrolians are absent from the full panel of 432 / 1 , it may be inferred that they revolted in 432 , along with Poteidaia (no. 598 ), the Chalkidians and the Bottiaians (Thuc. 1 . 58 . 2 ), and thus, that they lived somewhere in the Chalkidic peninsula."
567,Chytropolis (Chytropolites),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,97,580,"567 . Chytropolis (Chytropolites) Map 51 . Unlocated.Type: C: α . The toponym is Χυρόπολις (Theopomp. fr. 141 apud Steph. Byz. 698 . 16 -18 ); the city-ethnic is Χυτροπολίτης (ibid.). According to Stephanos, Chytropolis was called a chorion by Theopompos, but Theopompos also mentioned that it was settled ( απΩsubiotaωκισ µ ένον ) by Aphytis. Furthermore, he called the inhabitants Chytropolitai . It is difficult to determine whether Chytropolis was a polis , and if so, where it was located. Zahrnt (( 1971 ) 254 ) suggests that it was situated within the territory of Aphytis."
568,Dikaia (Dikaiopolites),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.3,22.55,643,2927,"568 . Dikaia (Dikaiopolites) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 30 , long. 22 . 55 . Size of territory: ? Type: [A]: α . The toponym is ∆ίκαια ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 27 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) no. 392 ). The city-ethnic is ∆ικαιοπολίτης ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 55 -56 ). The Dikaiopolitai are listed once under the heading Ηαίδε το ˜ ν πόλεον in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 51 , 55 -56 , restored in IG i³ 281 . ii . 31 ff) and again under the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε as members of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 .B. 9 ); in both contexts polis is used in the political sense. The collective city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 55 -56 ). In the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi , Dikaia is listed between Aineia and Poteidaia ( IG ii² . 1 94 . i .b. 11 ( 360 / 59 )), and Pliny mentions it after Therme ( HN 4 . 36 ). It is not, however, mentioned by Herodotos or Ps.-Skylax in their descriptions of the coast of the Chalkidic peninsula, so it may be inferred that Dikaia was situated inland, somewhere in the north-western part of the Chalkidic peninsula; see also Viviers ( 1987 ) 194 -95 . Dikaia was colonised from Eretria ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 55 -56 ) and the earliest coins of Dikaia bear Eretrian types (bull/octopus; see Allan ( 1940 ) 34 ). Dikaia was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 19 -20 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 55 -56 ) a total of sixteen times, once completely restored. It is absent from the full panel of 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . ii . 37 -67 ), which may indicate that it participated in the Revolt of 432 (Thuc. 1 . 58 ); but it is recorded in the lists of 430 / 29 and 429 / 8 after the heading αιasperacuteδε τῶν πόλεων αυτηgraveν τηgraveν απαρχηgraveν απήγαγον ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 35 , 282 . ii . 55 -56 ), paying 4 tal. in 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 19 -20 ) and 5 tal. in 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . ix . 8 , ethnic partly restored). In 435 / 4 it paid 1 tal. ( IG i³ 277 . vi . 15 -16 ). In 430 / 29 and in 429 / 8 , however, it paid the quota only, i.e. 100 dr. In all other years the amount is restored by the editors. Dikaia became a member of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 .B. 9 ; Kahrstedt ( 1936 ) 440 ) and is also recorded in the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi of 360 / 59 ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 11 ). Dikaia struck silver coins on the Euboic standard from c. 500 to c. 350 . Denominations: tetradrachms, tetrobols, diobols and obols. ( 1 ) 500 -450 . Types: obv . cow, or cock: legend: occasionally ∆Ι , ∆ΙΚΑ or ∆ΙΚΑΙ ; rev . octopus in incuse square. Some coins have the city's name in full: ∆ΙΚΑΙΑ . There are several other types. ( 2 ) C4f. Types: obv . head of Athena, or female head; rev . bull; legend: ∆ΙΚΑΙΟΠΟΛΙΤΩΝ (Head, HN ² 213 -14 ; Gaebler ( 1935 ) 59 ; SNG Cop. Macedonia 156 )."
569,Dion (Dieus),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.2,24.1,526,2419,"569 . Dion (Dieus) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 20 , long. 24 . 10 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A: β . The toponym is ∆ῖον , τοgrave (Hdt. 7 . 22 . 3 ; Thuc. 4 . 109 . 3 ). The city-ethnic is ∆ιευacuteς ( IG i³ 269 . ii . 35 ; Thuc. 5 . 35 . 1 ). Dion is called a polis in the urban sense by Hdt. 7 . 22 . 3 and Ps.-Skylax 66 (Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ), whereas Thuc. 4 . 109 . 3 -5 probably uses polis in the political sense,using polisma about the settlement.The collective and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in the Athenian tribute lists (e.g. IG i³ 269 . ii . 35 ). Dion was situated on Athos ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 59 ; Hdt. 7 . 22 . 3 ; Thuc. 4 . 109 . 3 ). Dion was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 26 , restored) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 22 ) a total of seventeen times, three times completely restored, paying 1 tal. throughout the period ( IG i³ 269 . ii . 35 ). In 454 / 3 it formed a syntelic group with Sane and Olophyxos. During the Peloponnesian War Dion withstood an attack from Brasidas in 423 , and consequently its territory was ravaged (Thuc. 4 . 109 . 5 ). The incident indicates that Dion was fortified. In 421 Dion took Thyssos, which was situated about 10 km from Dion on the opposite coast of the peninsula (Thuc. 5 . 35 . 1 ). Thyssos was an Athenian ally at that time, and Dion may have been so too, since it is known that it did not revolt against Athens and join the Chalkidians until 417 (Thuc. 5 . 82 . 1 ). Dion was also a member of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 .B. 32 -33 ). C. 349 Dion may have sent envoys to Athens (the text is restored ∆ι [ ηtildeς ], l. 4 ) to ask for help against Philip ( IG ii² 210 + 259 ; Schweigert ( 1937 ) 329 -32 ). A C4 coin found in 1928 may be attributed to Dion: obv . Athena; rev . tripod; legend: ∆ΙΕΩΝ . It is uncertain whether the coin was issued in Dion in Pieria or Dion on Akte, but Robinson and Clement prefer Dion on Akte (( 1938 ) 282 ; cf. Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 172 ). According to Strabo ( 7 frr. 33 , 35 ), Dion and the four other poleis of Athos were founded by Pelasgians from Lemnos. Thuc. 4 . 109 . 3 informs us that in his day Dion had a mixed (i.e. barbarian-Hellenic) bilingual population, but a century later Dion is called a &lt;polis&gt; Hel by Ps.-Skylax 66 (Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1998 ) 151 )."
570,Eion,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,175,900,"570 . Eion Not in Barr . Maps 50 -51 . Unlocated. Size of territory: ? Type: C: α . Only the toponym ' Ηιών is known (Thuc. 4 . 7 ). Virtually nothing is known of Eion, which Thuc. 4 . 7 calls a Μενδαίων αποικία , perhaps indicating that it was a polis . It is not the same as its better-known namesake on the Thracian coast: Steph. Byz. distinguishes between the two and calls this one πόλις εν χερρονήσΩsubiotaω , ωasperς Θουκυδίδης and then adds: έστι καιgrave άλλη προgraveς τηsubiotaηtilde ΠιερίΩsubiotaα (cf. Eust. Il . 2 . 92 ). It is clear from Thuc. 4 . 7 that Eion was an enemy of the Athenians in 425 , but whether that means that it was once a member of the Delian League and had revolted in 432 , or that it had never been a member, is unknown.It never occurs in the Athenian tribute lists.In 425 the Athenians took Eion by treachery,which indicates that it was fortified (Thuc. 4 . 7 )."
571,Gale(psos) (Galaios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.1,23.4,829,4051,"571 . Gale(psos) (Galaios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 10 , long. 23 . 40 . Size of territory: 2 or 3 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Γαληψός (Hdt. 7 . 122 ; cf. Kinch ( 1894 ) 149 ). The city-ethnic is Γαλαῖος ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 8 ), which may be a derivative of a toponym * Γάλη ; if the coins discussed below belong to the present community,they attest the city-ethnic Γαλήψιος . It is possible that Herodotos confounded the name of *Gale with that of Galepsos (no. 631 ) in the Thasian peraia (Thuc. 4 . 107 . 4 ), so that the toponym is in fact *Gale and not Galepsos (Kinch ( 1894 ) 149 , followed by Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 178 , pace Lepper ( 1962 ) 35 ); there may, however, be numismatic evidence in support of Herodotos' form if the coins inscribed ΓΑΛΗΨΙΩΝ ( infra ) were struck by the present community.Hdt. 7 . 122 calls Gale(psos) a polis principally in the urban,but probably also in the political sense. The political sense is attested in IG i³ 278 . vi . 5 , 8 and 279 . ii . 76 , 78 , where the Galaians are listed under the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 8 ). The undated Athenian grave inscription with the ethnikon Galepsios ( SEG 32 297 ) probably belongs to Galepsos (no. 631 ) in the Thasian peraia . According to Hdt. 7 . 122 , Gale(psos) was situated on Sithonia between Torone and Sermylia. Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 178 locates Gal(epsos) south of Neos Marmaras, where a pithos grave containing Archaic Attic and Corinthian pottery has been found ( ArchDelt 42 ( 1987 ) Chron . 371 ). For a sanctuary presumably in its territory, see supra 815 on Parthenopolis. Gale(psos) supplied Xerxes with troops and ships in 480 (Hdt. 7 . 122 ). It was a member of the Delian League. The Galaians belonged to the Thracian district and are recorded for the first time in 436 / 5 ( IG i³ 276 . v . 26 ) and in the subsequent three years. In 435 / 4 the Galaians are recorded as άτακτοι ( IG i³ 277 . v . 31 ). In 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 8 ) and in 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 78 ) they are listed after the heading πόλεις αυταιgrave φόρον ταξά µ εναι , paying 500 dr. in 436 / 5 and 435 / 4 , and 3 , 000 dr. in 434 / 3 and 433 / 2 . Since Gale(psos) is not recorded in the lists after 432 / 1 , it may have participated in the Revolt of 432 (Thuc. 1 . 58 . 2 ) and was presumably one of the poleis that took part in the synoecism of Olynthos (no. 588 ) in 432 (Thuc. 1 . 58 . 2 ; Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 54 ). The wording of Thuc. 1 . 58 . 2 ( πόλεις . . . καταβαλόντας and καθαιρουtildeντες ταgraveς πόλεις ) suggests that the city was destroyed in connection with the synoecism. It was assessed at 10 dr. in 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . v . 24 ). In the early 1970 s a bronze coin (a) was found at the presumed site of Gale(psos) (Demetriadi ( 1974 )). Type: obv . young male head; rev . forepart of goat looking back; legend: ΓΑΛΗΨΙΩΝ . One other specimen (b), bought from a coin dealer, is known. The coins have been dated tentatively to C4f. The provenance of the coin found on Sithonia is the reason why these two coins have been attributed to the Gale(psos) under discussion and not to its namesake in the Thasian peraia (no. 631 ). Demetriadi ( 1974 ) claims that no coins from the Thracian Gale(psos) are known. However, in 1936 Bon published a coin (c) found during the excavations of Thasos and now (at least in 1936 ) in the Numismatic Museum in Athens,which she claims was struck at Galepsos (no. 631 ) in the Thasian peraia . There is absolutely no doubt that Bon and Demetriadi describe the same coin type. The diameters of (a) and (b) are 14 and 15 mm respectively, and the diameter of (c) is 13 mm. All three have on the obv . an identical head of a young man (Dionysos?) wearing an ivy wreath. On the rev ., coins (b) and (c) have the forepart of a goat (again the types are identical) facing l., and on (a) the goat faces r. All three have the legend ΓΑΛΗΨΙΩΝ . Hatzopoulos attributes the coins to Galepsos in the Thasian peraia (in conversation)."
572,Gigonos,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.2,23.0,226,1012,"572 . Gigonos Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 20 , long. 23 . 00 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A: α ? The toponym is Γίγωνος (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 ; IG i³ 278 . vi . 32 ). Apparently the C2 author Artemidoros called it Γιγωνίς , ηasper (Steph. Byz. 208 . 2 ). Apart from Steph. Byz. 208 . 1 there is no attestation of the cityethnic. Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 -3 calls Gigonos a polis in the urban and political senses combined (cf. Hansen ( 2000 a ) 175 -76 ), and the political sense is attested in IG i³ 278 . vi . 19 , 32 , where Gigonos is listed under the heading πόλες . According to Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 , Gigonos was located in Krousis. Gigonos was a member of the Delian League, but is recorded only once in the tribute lists, in 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 32 ), paying along with the Tindaians (no. 619 ), Kithas (no. 579 ), Smila (no. 611 ) and Haisa (no. 573 ), under the heading πόλεις αaspergraveς οιasper ιδιω ˜ ται ενέγραψαν φόρον φέρειν . It was perhaps assessed in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iv . 84 , completely restored)."
573,Haisa,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.2,23.05,403,1860,"573 . Haisa Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 20 , long. 23 . 05 . Size of territory: 1 ? Type: A: α . The toponym is h αῖσα ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 33 ). Apart from Steph. Byz. 54 . 11 , there is no attestation of the city-ethnic. Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 mentions a polis Λίσαι in Krousis. Lisai is not known from any other source, and it is commonly assumed that ∆ίσαι is a scribal error for Αιaspertildeσα (Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 145 ). If so, Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 -3 calls Haisa a polis mainly in the urban,but probably also in the political sense (cf. Hansen ( 2000 a ) 175 -76 ). In the Athenian tribute lists Haisa is recorded under the heading πόλεις αaspergraveς οιasper ιδιο ∼ ται ενέγραψαν φόρον φέρειν ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 18 -21 , 33 ), where polis is used in the political sense. Haisa was a member of the Delian League. However, it occurs only once in the tribute lists: viz . in 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 33 ), where it pays along with the Tindaians (no. 619 ), Kithas (no. 579 ), Smila (no. 611 ) and Gigonos (no. 572 ). They pay 3 , 000 dr.altogether.The toponym is completely restored in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iv . 85 ), but the amount ( 3 , 000 dr.) is legible. Haisa may have been listed in the assessment decree of 422 / 1 (the heading in IG i³ 77 . v . 41 -42 is restored [ πόλε ] ς [ Κροσσί ] δος ). Excavations at Nea Kallikrateia have revealed potsherds from the early Iron Age and the Geometric period ( ArchDelt 31 ( 1976 ) Chron . 247 ), and remains of a C5settlement ( ArchDelt 29 ( 1973 -74 ) Chron . 697 , 677 -78 ). According to the excavators, the site is a colony of at least C8l. It was occupied until the beginning of Christian times. The site has not yet been positively identified with Haisa ( ArchDelt 32 ( 1977 ) Chron . 202 ). Additional finds (C5 graves) are mentioned in ArchDelt 33 ( 1978 ) Chron . 236 , 34 ( 1979 ) Chron . 279 ."
574,Istasos,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,75,345,"574 . Istasos Map 51 . Unlocated. Type: C:? The toponym is /acuteΙστασος ( IG i³ 77 . v . 16 ). Istasos may have been a member of the Delian League. In 422 / 1 it was assessed at 500 dr. ( IG i³ 77 . v . 16 ), but is unattested in the tribute lists. The editors of the Athenian tribute lists ( ATL i. 538 ) identify Istasos with Pistasos (s.v.)."
575,Kalindoia,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.35,23.2,321,1570,"575 . Kalindoia Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 35 , long. 23 . 20 . Size of territory: ? Type: [A]: α . The toponym is Καλίνδοια ( IG i³ 76 . 45 = Tod 68 ( 422 ); IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 13 ( 360 / 59 )); Steph. Byz. 75 . 7 gives Αλίνδοια . Apart from Steph. Byz. 75 . 8 , there is no attestation of the city-ethnic. Kalindoia is listed under the heading αιasperacuteδε πόλες in a treaty of c. 422 ( IG i³ 76 . 44 , 45 ), where polis is used in the political sense. Kalindoia was situated in northern Bottike, perhaps on the border with Mygdonia,but it was clearly a Bottiaian polis (Flensted-Jensen ( 1995 ) 112 -15 ). C. 422 the Bottiaians entered into an alliance with the Athenians (Tod 68 = IG i³ 76 ). The same inscription seems to show that the Bottiaians had formed a confederacy at that time (Flensted-Jensen ( 1995 ) 126 -28 ). If they had, Kalindoia must have been one of the members (cf. Tod 68 . 46 ). Kalindoia is recorded in the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi of 360 / 59 ( IG iv² . 1 94 i .b. 13 ). The name of the theorodokos was Παυσανίας , who was probably the pretender to the Makedonian throne in 368 / 7 (Aeschin. 2 . 27 ) and in 360 / 59 (Diod. 16 . 2 . 6 ). He may also be the Pausanias who issued his own coins (M.C.J.Miller ( 1986 )). In 323 Kalindoia and three neighbouring territories were given to the Makedonians by Alexander ( SEG 36 626 . 4 -8 ). At modern Kalamoto (possibly the site of Kalindoia) pottery from the Classical through the Roman periods has been found, along with seven pits containing Archaic sherds (Sismanides and Keramaris ( 1992 ))."
576,Kamakai,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,265,1236,"576 . Kamakai Map 50 . Unlocated. Type: A:? The toponym is Κα µ ακαί ( IG i³ 285 . iii . 11 (C5 )) or [ Κ ] ε µ ακαί ( IG i³ 76 . 47 = Tod 68 . 48 ( 422 )). The city-ethnic is not recorded in any source. Kamakai is listed under the heading αιasperacuteδε πόλες in a treaty of c. 422 ( IG i³ 76 . 44 , 47 ), where polis is used in the political sense. Kamakai was a Bottiaian polis situated in the vicinity of Kalindoia, i.e. probably in northern Bottike (FlenstedJensen ( 1995 ) 116 -17 ). The name of its territory was Κα µ ακαία ( SEG 36 626 . 9 ). C. 422 the Bottiaians entered into an alliance with the Athenians (Tod 68 = IG i³ 76 ). The same inscription seems to show that the Bottiaians had formed a confederacy at that time (Flensted-Jensen ( 1995 ) 126 -28 ). If so, Kamakai must have been one of the members (cf. T od 68 . 48 ). Its territory was given to the Makedonians in 323 / 2 by Alexander ( SEG 36 626 . 4 -8 ). Kamakai was a member of the Delian League;it belonged to the Thracian district,but it is recorded only once in the tribute lists, namely in 421 / 20 ( IG i³ 285 . iii . 11 ), paying only 600 dr. About the same time the Bottiaians had probably formed a confederacy of which Kamakai was a member ( IG i³ 76 )."
577,Kampsa,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,253,1217,"577 . Kampsa Map 50 . Unlocated. Type: A: α ? The toponym is Κά µ ψα (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 ) or Κάψα (Steph. Byz. 370 . 18 ). ΚΑ is the legend on coins of C5e (Head, HN ² 212 ) and may represent the city-ethnic * Κα µ ψαῖος or * Καψαῖος , the latter being the city-ethnic suggested by Steph. Byz. 370 . 19 . Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 -3 calls Kampsa a polis mainly in the urban sense,but probably in the political sense too (cf. Hansen ( 2000 a ) 175 -76 ). Kampsa was located in Krousis (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 ). Some scholars have argued that the Skapsaians recorded in the Athenian tribute lists are the inhabitants of Kampsa (Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 232 , followed by Barr .). Kampsa may have struck silver coins before 480 (on the attribution to Kampsa, see Flensted-Jensen ( 1997 ) 122 -25 ). Denomination: tetrobols. Types: obv . ithyphallic ass and kylix; rev . mill-sail pattern and ΚΑ in two of four triangles (Head, HN ² 212 ; Gaebler ( 1935 ) 66 -67 ; SNG Cop.Macedonia 146 ). For the type, see Wroth ( 1900 ) 275 -76 ). The reverse punch is the same as that used for some of the coins of Mende (Gaebler ( 1935 ) 66 -67 ). Likewise, an ithyphallic ass is also depicted on the earliest coins of Mende, though it is not the same die."
578,Kissos (Kisseites),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,182,1014,"578 . Kissos (Kisseites) Unlocated. Type: C: α ? The toponym is Κισσός (Strabo 7 frr. 21 , 24 ). The city-ethnic is Κισσείτης ( SEG 40542 . 14 (C4 )). The only literary source to mention Kissos is Strabo, who says (frr. 21 , 24 ) that Kassandros founded Thessalonike by synoecising Kissos and other polismata and polichnia respectively.However,the city-ethnic is known from an inscription ( SEG 40 542 ) which can be dated either to c. 350 and assigned to northwestern Chalkidike (Hatzopoulou and Loukopoulou ( 1992 ) 123 -45 ), or to 294 / 3 and assigned to south-eastern Chalkidike (Vokotopoulou ( 1996 )). The inscription concerns the boundaries of various communities. An ancient settlement at the top of Mt. Chortiatis in north-western Chalkidike has been investigated by Bakalakis ( 1956 ). It consists of a circuit wall ( 250 × 40 m) with remains of houses. The pottery found at the settlement dates it to C4 . Hammond thinks that this must be ancient Kissos (Hammond ( 1972 ) 187 ; cf. Edson ( 1947 ) 89 )."
579,Kithas,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.25,23.05,165,776,"579 . Kithas Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 25 , long. 23 . 05 . Size of territory: ? Type: A:? Only the toponym Κίθας is known, from an Athenian tribute list in which Kithas is recorded under the heading πόλεις αaspergraveς οιasper ιδιῶται ενέγραψαν φόρον φέρειν ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 18 -21 , 30 ), where polis is used in the political sense. Kithas may have been a Bottiaian polis (FlenstedJensen ( 1995 ) 123 -24 ). Kithas was a member of the Delian League. However, it is recorded only once in the tribute lists, in 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 30 ), paying 3 , 000 dr. along with the Tindaians (no. 619 ), Smila (no. 611 ), Gigonos (no. 572 ) and Haisa (no. 573 ). The toponym is completely restored (but the amount is legible) in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iv . 83 )."
580,Kleonai,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.1,24.15,666,3209,"580 . Kleonai Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 10 , long. 24 . 15 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A: β . The toponym is Κλεωναί , αιasper (Hdt. 7 . 22 . 3 ; IG i³ 278 . vi . 23 (C5 )). Hdt. 7 . 22 . 3 and Ps.-Skylax 66 (cf. Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ) call Kleonai a polis in the urban sense, whereas Thuc. 4 . 109 . 3 -5 probably uses polis in the political sense, using polisma about the settlement.In the Athenian tribute lists Kleonai is twice recorded under the heading πόλεις ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 18 -21 , 23 and 279 .II. 89 -92 , 93 ). Hdt. 7 . 22 . 3 locates it on Athos. Kleonai was a member of the Delian League. It is recorded four times, in 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 23 ), 433 / 2 ( 279 . ii . 93 ), 430 / 29 ( 281 . iii . 62 , completely restored) and 429 / 8 ( 282 . ii . 49 ), always with its toponym. In 434 / 3 and 433 / 2 it is listed under the heading πόλεις αaspergraveς οιasper ιδιῶται ενέγραψαν φόρον φέρειν ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 23 , 279 . ii . 93 ), in 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 62 ) under the heading ταῖσδε ηasper βουληgrave καιgrave οιasper πεντακόσιοι καιgrave χιasperλιοι έταξαν (but here the name is completely, and the amount partly, restored), and in 429 / 8 under the heading ταῖσδε βουληgrave συgraveν τΩsubiotaῶ δικαστηρίΩsubiotaω έταξαν ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 49 ; the amount is completely, and the name partly, restored; it seems plausible, however, that Κ [..] ον [..] should be restored Κ [ λε ] ον [ αί ]). Kleonai paid 500 dr. in all four years. The editors of the Athenian tribute lists have suggested that the poleis listed after the headings αυταί and ιδιῶται wereeither cases of apotaxis or they were isolated or peripheral towns that had not been members of the Delian League ( ATL i. 455 ). If Kleonai was a case of apotaxis , we must assume that it had previously paid along with one of the poleis in its immediate vicinity-for instance Thyssos (no. 618 ), Dion (no. 569 ) or Olophyxos (no. 587 )-and we could reasonably (albeit not necessarily) have expected the payments by these towns to be lower in 434 . But there are no such changes in the payments of Thyssos, Dion or Olophyxos, so it is equally likely that Kleonai belongs to the group of poleis which were isolated and peripheral. The year 434 / 3 was probably the first year of a new assessment period, but Kleonai was not assessed by the normal procedure: it was added to the list of those already assessed. The same thing happened in the following year ( 433 / 2 ), but in 430 / 29 it was assessed by the boule and a court of 1 , 500 . The editors of the tribute lists interpret this as a sanctioning of Kleonai's assessment ( ATL i. 457 ). In 424 / 3 it joined Brasidas (Thuc. 4 . 109 . 4 ), but in 422 / 1 it was assessed at 100 dr. ( IG i³ 77 . v . 14 ). According to Aristotle (Heracl. Lemb. 62 ), Kleonai was colonised by Chalkidians from Elymnios (in Euboia = no. 365 ; see Bakhuizen ( 1976 ) 15 ), whereas Strabo ( 7 fr. 35 ) says that Pelasgians from Lemnos settled the five poleis on Athos. Thuc. 4 . 109 . 3 says that Kleonai had a mixed bilingual (i.e. Hellenic-barbarian) population, but about a century later Ps.-Skylax 66 calls it a polis Hel (Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 151 )."
581,Kombreia,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,206,1030,"581 . Kombreia Map 50 . Unlocated. Type: A:? The toponym is Κώ µ βρεια (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 ). Kinch ( 1894 ) 152 has suggested that the ending βρεια is the Thracian word βρια (meaning 'town') found in, e.g., Selymbria (see Detschew ( 1957 ) s.v. -bria), and some MSS do in fact have Κω µ βρία . The city-ethnic is Κο µ βρεάτης ( SEG 38 681 . 14 , an ephebic inscription of the first century ad ; see Papazoglou ( 1988 ) 419 ). It is significant that the city-ethnic occurs several centuries later than the latest reference to the town. This may mean that the town existed from c. 500 until the first century ad , but it may also mean that the (former) city-ethnic was used as a name, just as the city-ethnic ' Ολυacuteνθιος is attested long after the city Olynthos was destroyed (s.v. Olynthos). Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 -3 calls Kombreia a polis mainly in the urban sense, but probably in the political sense too (cf. Hansen ( 2000 a ) 175 -76 ). Kombreia was situated in Krousis and provided Xerxes with troops in 480 (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 )."
582,Lipaxos,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,117,536,"582 . Lipaxos Map 50 . Unlocated. Type: A:? The toponym is Λίπαξος (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 ). Apart from Steph. Byz. 418 . 7 , the city-ethnic is not attested. Hecat. fr. 149 ( apud Steph. Byz. 418 . 7 ) mentioned Lipaxos, but it is not clear whether he also called it a polis (cf. Hansen ( 1997 b )). Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 -3 calls Lipaxos a polis mainly in the urban sense, but probably in the political sense too (cf. Hansen ( 2000 a ) 175 -76 ). Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 locates Lipaxos in Krousis and says that it supplied Xerxes with troops in 480 ."
583,Mekyberna (Mekybernaios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.15,23.25,820,3903,"583 . Mekyberna (Mekybernaios) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 15 , long. 23 . 25 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Μηκυacuteβερνα , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 122 ; Harp. Μ 31 ) or Μηκυacuteπερνα (Strabo 7 fr. 29 ). The city-ethnic is Μηκυβερναῖος (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 6 ) or Μεκυπερναῖος ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 15 ; cf. Strabo 7 fr. 29 , who gives the corresponding toponym). Mekyberna is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.Skylax 66 (Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ) and in the urban and political senses combined by Hdt. 7 . 122 . At Thuc. 5 . 18 . 6 (Peace of Nikias) the territorial sense is a connotation. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists (e.g. IG i³ 263 . iii . 15 ). Hdt. 7 . 122 locates Mekyberna between Sermylia (no. 604 ) and Olynthos (no. 588 ) on Sithonia. According to Harp. Μ 31 , it was located 20 stades ( 3 . 6 km) from Olynthos, and excavations confirm this (Mylonas ( 1943 ) 78 ). It is not known who founded Mekyberna or when it was founded. The earliest attestation of Mekyberna is in Hecat. fr. 150 ; but the settlement identified with Mekyberna goes back to the early Archaic period ( infra ). Mekyberna supplied troops and ships to Xerxes in 480 (Hdt. 7 . 122 ). Mekyberna was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . v . 10 ), in which year it formed a syntelic group along with Stolos (no. 614 ) and the Polichnitans (no. 596 ). It is recorded for the last time in the list of 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 46 ), which probably means that it took part in the Revolt of 432 (Thuc. 1 . 58 ). It was assessed for tribute in 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . v . 23 , 10 dr.). Mekyberna is recorded in the tribute lists sixteen times, twice completely restored, paying 1 tal. in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 15 ) and in 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 12 ), 4 , 000 dr. from 446 / 5 ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 23 ) to 440 / 39 ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 45 ), and 1 tal. again from 436 / 5 ( IG i³ 277 . v . 19 ) to 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 46 ). According to the Peace of Nikias (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 6 ), the Mekybernaians, the Sanians (no. 600 ) and the Singaians (no. 605 ) were to live in their own poleis ( οικεῖν ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εasperαυτῶν )-many take this to mean that Mekyberna had taken part in the synoecism of Olynthos in 432 (in which connection it was probably razed; cf. the wording of Thuc. 1 . 58 . 2 : πόλεις . . . καταβαλόντας and καθαιρουtildeντες ταgraveς πόλεις ) and was now to be re-established as a polis (Demand ( 1990 ) 76 -77 ). Mekyberna was garrisoned by the Athenians, but in 420 it was captured by the Olynthians (Thuc. 5 . 39 . 1 ; cf. Diod. 12 . 77 . 5 ). In 349 , before attacking Olynthos, Philip captured Mekyberna by treachery (Diod. 16 . 53 . 2 ). Robinson (Robinson and Clement ( 1938 ) 373 -74 ; cf. Robinson ( 1952 ) 403 ) thinks that the city was not destroyed by Philip, and that it was still inhabited in Alexander's time (down to Kassandros). Ps.-Skymnos 641 refers to it as no longer in existence. Strabo ( 7 fr. 29 ) calls Mekyberna epineion Olynthou , which may be insignificant, but an underwater survey has shown that it is very likely that Mekyberna was actually the harbour town of Olynthos ( AAA 21 ( 1988 ) 102 -1 ; see also Mylonas ( 1943 ) 78 ). The ancient site near the harbour dates to the period 432 -316 . During the excavations of Olynthos, Robinson ( 1935 ) 229 -31 found 'the Hippodamian plan of the town [Mekyberna]' , along with shops and houses. Seven streets have been found,unpaved and c. 2 . 5 m wide (Mylonas ( 1943 ) 82 ). The houses differ very much in size, layout, etc. from those excavated at Olynthos (ibid. 84 ). Contrary to what has been found at Olynthos, there were no drainage alleys at Mekyberna (ibid.). The settlement goes back to the early Archaic period (ibid. 86 )."
584,Mende (Mendaios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.0,23.25,1511,7315,"584 . Mende (Mendaios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 00 , long. 23 . 25 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Μένδη , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 ; Thuc. 4 . 121 . 2 ) or Μένδα ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 26 ( 360 / 59 )). The city-ethnic is Μενδαῖος ( SEG 13 313 (C4 )). On Archaic coins it is sometimes ΜΙΝ∆ΑΟΝ or ΜΙΝ∆ΑΙΟΝ (Gaebler ( 1935 ) 73 -74 ). Mende is attested as a polis both in the urban sense (Thuc. 4 . 129 . 3 ) and in the political sense (Thuc. 4 . 121 . 2 ; Arist. Oec . 1350 a 8 , 14 ); in Ps.-Skylax 66 Mende is the second of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε εν τηsubiotaηtilde Παλλήνηsubiotaη ' Ελληνίδες , where polis is used in the urban sense. The collective use of the cityethnic is attested internally on coins of C5f ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists (e.g. IG i³ 270 . iii . 20 ) and in literary sources (Thuc. 4 . 123 . 2 ; Arist. Oec . 1350 a 6 ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally on a C4m Megarian gravestone ( SEG 13 313 ) and in Plato's reference to Αντί µ οιρος οasper Μενδαῖος ( Prt . 315 E). The territory, called γηtilde , is mentioned by Thuc. 4 . 130 . 2 , who says that it bordered on that of Skione (no. 609 ) and was ravaged by Nikias. Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 locates Mende on Pallene between Skione and Sane (no. 601 ) (cf. Ps.-Skylax 66 ).About 4 km from Mende, on a promontory, a sanctuary of Poseidon was found in 1989 , with building remains of C6l-C5 and pottery of C6e (Vokotopoulou ( 1989 ), ( 1990 a ), ( 1991 )). It is probably identical with the Ποσειδώνιον situated in the territory of Mende (Thuc. 4 . 129 . 3 ). No literary source gives the date of the colonisation of Mende, but according to the sources the site was a colony from Eretria (Thuc. 4 . 123 . 1 ; cf. Harp. s.v. Μένδη ). This is supported by the archaeological remains: the late Mycenaean and early Geometric pottery found at the site of ancient Mende is similar to that found at Lefkandi ( ArchDelt 42 ( 1987 ) Chron . 368 -69 , pace Papadopoulos ( 1996 )). Furthermore, peculiar stone-paved circles (diameter 1 . 80 m), similar to those found at Lefkandi, have been found inside house Η , which dates to C8 , along with pendant semicircle skyphoi ( ArchDelt 45 ( 1990 ) Chron . 315 and fig. 141 a; Vokotopoulou ( 1990 a )). Most scholars think that Mende was founded in C8 (Boardman ( 1980 ) 229 ). However, it seems that the site of Mende was occupied long before the colonisation took place, and that it had links with Euboia from a very early period. For interpretations of the finds, see Snodgrass ( 1994 ) and Papadopoulos ( 1996 ) 163 -65 . According to Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 , Mende supplied troops and ships to Xerxes in 480 . Mende was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 15 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . iii . 10 ) a total of nineteen times,paying between 5 tal. ( IG i³ 268 . iii . 5 ) and 15 tal. ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 15 ), but mostly 8 tal. ( IG i³ 262 . i . 7 ). In 423 Mende joined Brasidas, even though Athens and Sparta had already concluded an armistice (Thuc. 4 . 123 ; cf. Diod. 12 . 72 . 7 ). The uprising was instigated by an oligarchic faction which seems to have forced the majority to accept the defection (Thuc. 4 . 123 . 2 , cf. 4 . 121 . 2 ); an oligarchic constitution was adopted ( 4 . 130 . 7 ); a Peloponnesian garrison was placed in the city; and Brasidas had the women and children sent to Olynthos (no. 588 ) (Thuc. 4 . 123 . 4 ). The Athenians sent a force of 50 triremes, 1 , 000 hoplites and a higher number of light-armed soldiers against Mende ( 4 . 129 . 2 ). They took the proasteion , ravaged the territory, and eventually captured the city, when the Mendaian demos took up arms against the oligarchs and the Peloponnesian garrison and opened the gates (Thuc. 4 . 129 -30 ). Having arranged a siege of the oligarchs and the Peloponnesians ( 4 . 131 . 3 ), who made a last stand on the acropolis, the Athenians left a garrison in Mende, ordering that the Mendaians restore their (democratic) constitution and prosecute the leaders of the Revolt (Thuc. 4 . 130 . 7 ; Gehrke, Stasis 111 -12 ). From the treaty of the 380 s between Amyntas III and the Chalkidians, it appears that the Mendaians were enemies of the Chalkidians ( Syll . ³ 135 . 19 = Tod 111 ), and Mende is known to have been at war with Olynthos at some point in C4 (Arist. Oec . 1350 a 11 -14 ). Mende was probably not destroyed by Philip, but it may have lost its polis status. It is called a vicus maritimus of Kassandreia c. 200 (Livy 31 . 45 . 14 ). In C4e Theotimides, a citizen of Mende was granted proxenia by Elis (no. 251 ) ( SEG 15 241 ). About the same time, perhaps a little earlier, some Mendaians were granted proxenia in Delphi (no. 177 ) ( SEG 31 557 ; BCH 105 ( 1981 ) 433 -40 ). Mende is recorded in the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi of 360 / 59 ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 26 ). Thuc. 4 . 130 . 6 -7 and 131 . 3 mentions that Mende had a fortified acropolis. A Geometric wall surrounding the presumed acropolis of Mende has been found ( AR ( 1992 -93 ) 54 ). Thucydides also mentions the walls ( 4 . 130 . 3 ) and gates ( 4 . 130 . 2 , 5 ) of Mende,along with the proasteion ( 4 . 130 . 1 ). The harbours of Mende are mentioned at Arist. Oec . 1350 a 6 . Excavations at Mende have revealed various remains: a destruction layer from C4m can perhaps be connected with the Makedonian invasion in 356 or 348 ( ArchDelt 41 ( 1986 ) Chron . 148 ). Pits (probably used for storage) filled with debris from the Mycenaean to the Geometric periods show that the site of Mende was inhabited from an early period ( ArchDelt 41 ( 1986 ) Chron . 149 ). Two houses have been excavated in the proasteion , which seems to have been occupied continuously from C8 to C4 ( ArchDelt 41 ( 1986 ) Chron . 147 , 42 ( 1987 ) Chron . 369 ). Underneath house Θ (C8m) were found six more habitation layers, the earliest of C9m (Vokotopoulou ( 1990 a )). A cemetery has been found near the coast. It was in use from C8l to C7l/C6e. By 1990 , 214 graves had been found. Mende struck silver coins on the Euboic standard c. 500 -c. 424 and on the Phoenician standard c. 424 -c. 358 . Denominations: tetradrachms, tetrobols, obols, hemiobols, tritemorias and tetartemoria. ( 1 ) Silver, 500 -450 : types: obv . ithyphallic ass with crow on back; legend: ΜΕΝ , ΜΙΝ , ΜΙΝ∆ΑΟΝ or ΜΙΝ∆ΑΙΟΝ (sometimes no legend); rev . various forms of incuse square.

For an interpretation of the types, see Knoblauch ( 1998 )). Mende colonised Neapolis (no. 586 ) ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 26 -27 ), which was situated c. 12 km from Mende on the opposite coast of Pallene, and Eion (no. 570 ) (Thuc. 4 . 7 ), the location of which is unknown."
585,Milkoros (Milkorios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,299,1423,"585 . Milkoros (Milkorios) Map 51 . Unlocated. Type: [A]:? The toponym Μίλκωρος is known only from Steph. Byz. 453 . 11 quoting Theopomp.fr. 152 , presumably referring to the year 347 (Shrimpton ( 1991 ) 240 ). The city-ethnic is Μιλτόριος ( IG i³ 277 . vi . 31 ) or Μιλκόριος ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 85 ). In the Athenian tribute lists of 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 5 -6 , 9 ) and 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 76 -77 , 85 ) the Milkorians are recorded after the heading πόλεις αυταιgrave φόρον ταξά µ εναι . Steph. Byz. 453 . 11 describes Milkoros as a Χαλκιδικηgrave πόλις εν ΘρΩsubiotaάκηsubiotaη . Hemay have used Theopompos (cf.fr. 152 ) as a source for this information, which is ambiguous, since 'Chalkidian' can refer to either (a) the geographical position of the Milkorians, (b) membership of the Chalkidian Federation, or (c) ethnic affiliation. The editors of the Athenian tribute lists state that Milkoros must be a member of the Chalkidic state but that its precise location is not known ( ATL i. 520 ). Milkoros was a member of the Delian League.It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded three times in the tribute lists, in 435 / 4 ( IG i³ 277 . vi . 31 , άτακτοι ), in 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 9 ) and in 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 85 ). Some scholars believe that it took part in the Revolt of 432 (e.g. Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 205 ). It paid 1 , 000 dr. in 435 / 4 , and 500 dr. in the following two years."
586,Neapolis (Neopolites),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.0,23.3,520,2473,"586 . Neapolis (Neopolites) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 00 , long. 23 . 30 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Νέη Πόλις (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 ), or Νεάπολις ( IG i³ 267 . ii . 29 ). The city-ethnic is Νεοπολίτης ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 28 ). The citizens are sometimes called Νεοπολῖται εκ Παλλένες ( IG i³ 262 . i . 9 -10 ) in order to distinguish them from the other Neopolitans in the Thasian peraia (see infra no. 634 ), and sometimes they are identified politically as the Νεοπολῖται Μενδαίον άποικοι ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 26 -27 ) or simply the Νεοπολῖται Μενδαίον ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 13 ). The classification of Neapolis as a polis seems to follow from the toponym, but at Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 polis is used explicitly about the community, in the urban and political senses simultaneously (cf. Hansen ( 2000 a ) 175 -76 ). The collective city-ethnic is used externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 26 -27 ). Neapolis was probably a colony from Mende (no. 584 ) ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 26 -27 ). Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 locates the city between Aphytis (no. 563 ) and Aige (no. 556 ) on Pallene and says that Neapolis supplied troops and ships to Xerxes in 480 . Neapolis was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 28 ) to, perhaps, 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . iii . 6 : in this case it is not certain whether the Neapolis listed is the Thasian Neapolis (no. 634 ) or Neapolis on Pallene) a total of twenty (or perhaps twenty-one) times,paying 3 , 000 dr.in all years ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 28 ). A settlement of C6 -C5 , at modern Polychronon,has been excavated since 1987 , and it has been suggested that Polychronon is ancient Neapolis ( AR ( 1988 -89 ) 73 , ( 1989 -90 ) 52 ), although it may also be Aige (Vokotopoulou ( 1993 ) 95 ). The following have been found at Polychronon: sherds from the Archaic and Classical periods, a C5 kiln, remains of C6 buildings, two cemeteries dating to C6l-C4m ( ArchDelt 42 ( 1987 ) Chron . 369 -70 ; Vokotopoulou ( 1990 b )). The place was probably abandoned in C4s ( ArchDelt 43 ( 1988 ) Chron . 364 ). An inscribed sherd, c. 500 , bears the word δε µ οσίε ( SEG 39 614 ; photo in Vokotopoulou et al . ( 1988 ) fig. 16 ). The ancient settlement was located on the slopes of a hill, and the houses were placed on terraces. The walls were either parallel to the terraces or vertical retaining walls (Vokotopoulou et al . ( 1989 ))."
587,Olophyxos (Olophyxios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.2,24.1,452,2065,"587 . Olophyxos (Olophyxios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 20 , long. 24 . 10 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A: β . The toponym is ' Ολόφυξος , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 22 . 3 ; schol. Ar. Av . 1042 ) or, once, ' Ολόφυξις (Strabo 7 fr. 33 ) or ' Ολυacuteφυξις (Ps.-Skylax 66 , emended to ' Ολόφυξος ). The city-ethnic is ' Ολοφυacuteχσιος ( IG i³ 268 . ii . 23 ; Ar. Av . 1041 ) or sometimes ' Ολοφυacuteχσιος εχς Αacuteθο ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 22 ). Hdt. 7 . 22 . 3 and Ps.-Skylax 66 (cf. Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ) call Olophyxos a polis in the urban sense, whereas Thuc. 4 . 109 . 3 -5 probably uses polis in the political sense, using polisma about the settlement. The collective city-ethnic is used internally on coins ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 268 . ii . 23 ). Olophyxos was located on Athos (Hdt. 7 . 22 . 3 ; Thuc. 4 . 109 . 3 ; IG i³ 281 . ii . 22 ). Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 184 , 208 suggests that it was situated at modern Vatopediou or Iviron (on the northern side of the peninsula). Olophyxos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 , paying together with Sane (no. 600 ) and Dion (no. 569 ) ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 25 -26 ) and then, paying separately, until 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 26 ) a total of sixteen times, three times completely restored, paying 2 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 262 . i . 26 ) except in 448 / 7 , when it paid 1 , 500 dr. ( IG i³ 264 . ii . 25 ). In 424 / 3 Olophyxos revolted from Athens at the instigation of Brasidas (Thuc. 4 . 109 . 4 ). Strabo says that Olophyxos and the other four poleis on Athos (nos. 560 , 569 , 580 , 618 ) were settled by Pelasgians from Lemnos ( 7 fr. 35 ). According to Thuc. 4 . 109 . 3 -4 , Olophyxos had a mixed (i.e. barbarian-Hellenic) bilingual population, but about a century later it is called a &lt;polis&gt; Hel by Ps.Skylax 66 (Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 151 ). Olophyxos struck bronze coins, c. 350 . Types: obv . female head; rev . eagle; legend: ΟΛΟΦΥΞΙΩΝ (Gaebler ( 1935 ) 83 -84 ; Head, HN ² 206 )."
588,Olynthos (Olynthios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.15,23.25,2641,13040,"588 . Olynthos (Olynthios) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 15 , long. 23 . 25 . Size of territory: 5 , after 432 c. 630 km ² , in C4larger. Type: A: α . The toponym is /acuteΟλυνθος , ηasper (Thuc. 1 . 63 . 1 ; Dem. 9 . 56 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ολυacuteνθιος (Dem. 1 . 7 ; SEG 21 982 (C4 )). Olynthos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 8 . 127 ; Thuc. 1 . 58 . 2 ; Dem. 9 . 11 ; Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 3 ; Ps.-Skylax 66 ; cf. Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ), and in the political sense (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 5 : Peace of Nikias; Dem. 3 . 7 ). At Thuc. 5 . 18 . 6 the territorial sense is a connotation. The collective city-ethnic is used externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 50 ), and internally on coins (Gaebler ( 1935 ) 84 ( c. 432 -420 )) and sling-bullets (Robinson ( 1941 ) no. 2220 ) with the legend ΟΛΥΝ . The individual city-ethnic is used externally in funerary inscriptions from Attika ( SEG 21 982 (C4l)) and Thasos (no. 526 ) ( IG xii . 8434 ( c. 400 )). The use of the city-ethnic is attested long after Olynthos was destroyed ( SEG 19 595 , from Thasos (C4 -C3 ); IG xii . 3 42 , from Telos (C2 ); Syll . ³ 751 , from Mytilene (C1 ); see Gude ( 1933 ) 39 -50 (a complete Prosopographia Olynthia ) and Papazoglou ( 1988 ) 426 -27 ). Demosthenes ( 1 . 5 , 9 . 56 ) and Hypereides (Hyp. fr. 80 , Sauppe) use patris about Olynthos, and Dem. 9 . 56 refers to the politai of Olynthos ( 9 . 56 ). The name of Olynthos' territory was ' Ολυνθία (Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 18 ; SEG 38 619 . 11 ( c. 285 ); Theophr. Caus. Pl. 1 . 20 . 4 ). After the synoecism in 432 (Thuc. 1 . 58 . 2 ) the size of the territory was perhaps 630 km ² , but in the 380 s it was much larger (Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 71 ). According to Dem. 19 . 263 , the military strength of Olynthos before the synoecism was 400 cavalry and in all some 5 , 000 men in service, corresponding to some 7 , 000 adult male citizens; see Hansen ( 1985 ) 9 -13 , 18 -20 . (Xenophon's figures for 382 ( Hell . 5 . 2 . 14 ) are corrupt. Demosthenes' 1 , 000 horse and 10 , 000 foot in 348 ( 19 . 266 ) are the army of the Chalkidic Confederacy, not that of Olynthos.) Given the growth of Olynthos in the following period,a total of 7 , 000 citizens before the synoecism matches Diodorus' information that, in 357 , Olynthos had a large population ( 16 . 8 . 4 ) and that, in 348 , it was a myriandros polis : i.e. a polis with 10 , 000 citizens ( 32 . 4 . 2 ). In the period 432 -380 the population living in the urban centre of Olynthos (see infra ) was probably less than 5 , 000 , and in 370 -348 less than 10 , 000 (Hansen ( 1997 a ) 30 ; cf. Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 72 ). Olynthos supplied Xerxes with troops and ships in 480 (Hdt. 7 . 122 ). Hdt. 8 . 127 says that Olynthos belonged to the Bottiaians before 479 , and that it was handed over to the Chalkidians in 479 . This is confirmed by the pottery found during the excavations of Olynthos. Above the destruction layer of 479 the sherds were Attic red-figure, but underneath the destruction layer was found pottery 'that bears no resemblance to the ware produced at the same time in Attica' (Robinson ( 1933 b ) 15 -16 ). In 424 Olynthos is called 'Chalkidian'by Thuc. 4 . 123 . 4 (see Hornblower ( 1997 )). Olynthos was a member of the Delian League.It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . v . 6 , forming a syntelic group with Ass(er)a (no. 564 ) and the Skablaians (no. 607 )) to 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 45 ) a total of eleven times, paying 2 tal. ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 30 ). In 432 the Chalkidians (represented by Olynthos in the tribute lists) revolted from Athens,along with Poteidaia (no. 598 ) and the Bottiaians, at the instigation of Perdikkas, who also suggested that the Chalkidians abandon their poleis on the coast and create a larger and stronger city at Olynthos (Thuc. 1 . 57 . 5 , 58 . 2 ; cf. Diod. 12 . 34 . 2 ). In the Peace of Nikias Olynthos is declared autonomos and liable to the tribute assessed by Aristeides (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 5 ). Olynthos was the leading member of the Chalkidian Federation, which was formed some time after 432 (West ( 1918 ) 31 and Larsen ( 1968 ) 62 suggest 432 ; Gude ( 1933 ) 23 and Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 80 ff after 400 ; cf. Demand ( 1990 ) 196 n. 28 ). It is uncertain whether the federation was formed simultaneously with the synoecism of Olynthos, or later. In official documents the name of the federation is οιasper Χαλκιδεῖς ( Syll . ³ 135 . 3 ), but in literature it is often οιasper ' Ολυacuteνθιοι (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 13 ). In the Corinthian War the Chalkidians seem to have fought on Athens' side (Isae. 5 . 46 ; Diod. 14 . 82 . 3 ). In the 380 s the Federation evidently covered the western part of the Chalkidic peninsula all the way to Pella (no. 543 ). Apollonia (no. 545 ) and Akanthos (no. 559 ) saw the Federation encroaching on their lands and sent envoys to Sparta to ask for help against it (Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 11 ff). This resulted in the so-called Olynthian War,after which the Chalkidians had to surrender to the Spartans (Xen. 5 . 3 . 1 -10 , 18 -19 , 26 ; Diod. 15 . 19 . 3 , 21 . 1 -23 . 3 ; siege mentioned by Isoc. 4 . 126 ; Diod. 15 . 23 . 3 with Stylianou ( 1998 ) 209 -26 ). The Federation was suppressed or dissolved, but formed again shortly after: the Chalkidians are listed as members of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 .B. 5 -6 ; cf. Dreher ( 1995 ) 186 -87 ). The original members of the Chalkidian Federation are not known, but possible candidates are Ass(er)a (no. 564 ), Gale(psos) (no. 571 ), Mekyberna (no. 583 ), Milkoros (no. 585 ), Piloros (no. 593 ), Singos (no. 605 ), Skablaioi (no. 607 ) and Stolos (no. 614 ). In 356 Philip II concluded an alliance with the Chalkidic Federation (Tod 158 ) whereby Poteidaia (no. 598 ), when conquered, and Anthemous (no. 562 ) were ceded to Olynthos (Dem. 2 . 7 , 20 ; 6 . 20 , 23 . 107 ; Diod. 16 . 8 . 3 -5 ). But in 349 the Olynthians concluded an alliance with Athens (Dem. 1 and 2 ; Philoch. fr. 49 ). Philip attacked Olynthos, won two battles and laid siege to the city. The Athenians sent three auxiliary forces; but in August 348 , Olynthos was betrayed to Philip by the leaders of its cavalry (Dem. 9 . 11 , 19 . 263 -67 ; Diod. 16 . 53 . 2 ; Philoch. frr. 49 -51 ; Suda Κ 356 ; see Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 324 n. 1 ). Olynthos experienced andrapodismos twice, in 479 and in 348 : when in 479 the Olynthians were suspected of revolting against the Persians, the inhabitants were killed and the city given to the Chalkidians (Hdt. 8 . 127 ). The town was probably burnt (Robinson ( 1933 b ) 15 ). The city was synoecised in 432 , when the coastal poleis in the neighbourhood of Olynthos were abandoned and the inhabitants moved to Olynthos (Thuc. 1 . 58 ; Moggi, Sin . 173 -88 ), thus causing the formerly small town to be enlarged (Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 74 -76 fig. 55 ). In the years after 379 the urban centre of Olynthos was considerably enlarged (ibid. 92 ), presumably the result of a new synoikismos by which more Chalkidians were moved to Olynthos (Dem. 19 . 263 ). Xenophon calls Olynthos 'the largest polis of Thrace'( Hell . 5 . 2 . 12 ). In 348 the city was completely destroyed by Philip (Dem. 9 . 26 , 9 . 56 ; Hyp. fr. 80 , Sauppe), and the inhabitants suffered andrapodismos once more (Diod. 16 . 53 . 3 ), although some of them evidently managed to flee, e.g. to Lemnian Myrina (no. 502 ) ( IG xii . 8 4 ). Diod. 19 . 52 . 2 (r 316 ) mentions surviving Olynthians too.According to Theophrastos ( apud Harp. 162 . 10 -11 ), the Olynthians living in Athens after the destruction of Olynthos were isoteleis . Even though it seems clear that Olynthos was razed to the ground in 348 , it must have been refounded, though not necessarily as a polis : a couple are recorded as living εν ' ΟλυacuteνθΩsubiotaω in the imperial period ( SEG 38 625 ), and Hatzopoulos ( 1988 b ) 64 -65 argues that Olynthos was a kome of Kassandreia at that time. The character of the Olynthian constitution is unknown: some scholars think that Olynthos was an oligarchy (Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 94 ; Larsen ( 1968 ) 58 ff, esp. 76 ), whereas others argue that it was a democracy (Gehrke, Stasis 124 ). Theopomp. fr. 143 mentions the boule , and Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 17 a popular assembly ( demos ) whose decisions are described as psephismata ( 5 . 2 . 15 ). Dem. 9 . 56 reports how the assembly ( οasper δηtilde µ ος οasper τῶν ' Ολυνθίων ) imposed a sentence of exile.Not much is known about Olynthian officials; but hipparchoi are known to have been elected by show of hands (Dem. 9 . 66 ). Olynthos is recorded in the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi of 360 / 59 ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 14 ). Olynthos is sometimes thought to represent the Chalkidian Federation in the list (e.g. Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 103 ). Hegias of Olynthos was granted citizenship by Ephesos (no. 844 ) in C4l/C3e ( SEG 39 1156 ). Olynthos was excavated in the 1930 s. The town was situated on a table-shaped hill,about 3 . 5 km from the coast.Down to c. 432 Olynthos was a relatively small town (it probably covered c. 6 ha: Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 74 ), occupying the southern part of the elevation on which the city was built. In 432 the city was greatly enlarged (to cover c. 27 ha) and during the first 20 years of C4 it was enlarged once more:this time houses were built outside the city walls (ibid. 76 -91 figs. 55 and 56 ). The old part of the city did not have a grid plan, but the new town was laid out in rectangular fashion in blocks of up to ten houses of the so-called pastas type (ibid. 34 -38 and figs. 23 and 24 ; Wycherley ( 1976 ) 187 -92 ). The elevation on which Olynthos was situated is about 600 m long, and runs almost exactly north-south. Nearly the whole north hill is divided into sections by streets (Robinson and Graham ( 1938 ) 18 ff). On the urban organisation of Olynthos, see also Cahill ( 2002 ). Not many public buildings have been identified, exceptions being the agora (Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 78 ), along with a C5l bouleuterion (Gneisz ( 1990 ) 341 , no. 48 (C5l)) and a public building that has been variously identified as a prytaneion (ibid. 342 , no. 49 (C5e)) or a bouleuterion (S. G. Miller ( 1978 ) 131 -32 ). The south room accommodated c. 250 persons (McDonald ( 1943 ) 236 ), which indicates that it may have been a dikasterion . The city walls of Olynthos are mentioned by Thuc. 1 . 63 . 2 and Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 5 , who also mentions towers. However, hardly anything is left.The city walls were built of mudbrick, mostly on a rubble foundation.No sherds or any other evidence useful for dating the wall have been found (Robinson and Graham ( 1938 ) 39 -44 ). There are a few remains of a free-standing fountain house with an underground aqueduct made of terracotta pipes. It is one of the best-preserved Greek aqueducts. Robinson argues that it was completed before 400 , or perhaps even before 420 , and that the source of the aqueduct was at modern Polygyros, about 15 km to the north-east of Olynthos (Robinson ( 1946 ) 95 -114 ; on the water management, see Crouch ( 1993 ) 171 -76 ). Remains of what may have been an Archaic temple (destroyed in 479 ) have been found (Robinson ( 1930 ) 16 -17 ). The excavations at Olynthos brought to light not only vases, mosaics, etc., but also more curious things, such as ear-picks, tweezers and fish-hooks (Robinson ( 1941 ) 354 -55 , 355 -56 , 365 -74 ). At least eight Panathenaic vases have been identified, indicating that Olynthians must have participated and been victorious in the Panathenaic Games (Robinson ( 1933 b ) 87 -90 nos. 97 -100 , ( 1950 ) 9 , 59 -66 nos. 11 -14 ). Around the city were three cemeteries (Robinson ( 1942 )). The largest is the so-called Riverside cemetery, containing 528 graves, the cemeteries to the east and north being much smaller. There were altogether 598 graves. The Riverside cemetery is the earliest of the three,although no grave can be dated earlier than C6l. Graves in the eastern cemetery date to C5l, and those in the northern one to C4f (ibid. 137 ). Six month names are known,principally from C4m deeds of sale (Hatzopoulos ( 1988 a ) 65 -66 , 80 ), attesting to a clear affinity between the Olynthian calendar and that of the Euboian cities (Trümpy, Monat . 42 -43 ). Olynthos started striking silver coins on the Phoenician standard c. 433 . Denominations: tetradrachms, octobols, tetrobols and diobols. Types: obv . horse; rev . eagle holding snake; legend: ΟΛ or ΟΛΥΝ . From 432 , or perhaps later, down to 348 , the coins have obv . head of Apollo; rev . a kithara; legend: ΧΑΛΚΙ∆ΕΩΝ . Some have magistrates' names on rev . The Chalkidians also struck gold and bronze coins in C4 (Head, HN ² 207 ; Gaebler ( 1935 ) 84 -89 ; Robinson and Clement ( 1938 ) 1 -210 ; Westermark ( 1988 ); SNG Cop. Macedonia 233 -49 ). Some C5f coins inscribed ΧΑΛΚ must be attributed to Chalkis ( LSAG 82 -83 , 364 ), rather than to Olynthos (no. 365 ) (Head, HN ² 207 )."
589,(Osbaioi),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,165,891,"589 . (Osbaioi) Map 50 . Unlocated. Type: C:? Only the city-ethnic is known: ' Οσβαῖος ( SEG 40 534 ( c. 400 )). The individual city-ethnic is used externally on a gravestone from Beroia ( SEG 40 534 ), and the collective city-ethnic is used externally(?) in an inscription concerning borders ( SEG 40 542 . 26 , 32 ). There is some dispute as to the provenance and date of this inscription. Vokotopoulou ( 1996 ) assigns it to south-eastern Chalkidike and dates it to 294 / 3 , whereas Hatzopoulos and Loukopoulou ( 1992 ) 123 -45 assign it to north-western Chalkidike and date it to c. 350 . Since the ethnic is known exclusively from these two inscriptions, there is no way of telling whether Osbaios is a sub-ethnic, a city-ethnic or a regional ethnic (for these distinctions, see Hansen ( 1996 ) esp. 182 -90 ), although Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 202 seems certain that it is a cityethnic."
590,Othoros (Othorios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,293,1317,"590 . Othoros (Othorios) Map 51 . Unlocated. Type: [A]:? The toponym is /acuteΟθορος ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 35 ). The city-ethnic is ' Οθόριος ( IG i³ 269 . iii . 27 ). In the Athenian tribute list of 434 / 3 Othoros is recorded after the heading πόλεις αaspergraveς οιasper ιδιο ∼ ται ενέγραψαν φόρον φέρειν ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 18 -21 , 35 ). The location of Othoros is not known. It disappears from the tribute lists in 434 / 3 , which indicates that Othoros took part in the Revolt of 432 (Thuc. 1 . 58 ) and was, therefore, situated somewhere on the Chalkidic peninsula (see Edson ( 1947 ) 99 ). However, the editors of the Athenian tribute lists think it may have been situated near Methone ( ATL i. 489 ). Othoros was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 448 / 7 ( IG i³ 264 . ii . 18 ) to 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 35 ) a total of nine times, three times completely restored. It is recorded once by toponym ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 35 ), and otherwise by cityethnic, paying between 500 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 35 ) and 700 dr. ( IG i³ 269 . iii . 27 ). In 435 / 4 the Othorians are recorded as ataktoi ( IG i³ 277 . vi . 24 ). In 422 / 1 Othoros was assessed for tribute of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 77 . v . 15 ). Othoros is not known from any other source."
591,Pharbelos (Pharbelios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,298,1333,"591 . Pharbelos (Pharbelios) Map 51 . Unlocated. Type: [A]:? The toponym is Φάρβηλος ( IG i³ 268 . ii . 24 ; Steph. Byz. 658 . 15 ). The city-ethnic is Φαρβέλιος ( IG i³ 268 . ii . 24 ). In the Athenian tribute lists of 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 5 -6 , 15 ) and 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 76 -77 , 86 ) the Pharbelians are recorded after the heading πόλες αυταιgrave ταχσά µ εναι . The Pharbelians were members of the Delian League. They belonged to the Thracian district and are recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . i . 15 ) to 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 86 ) a total of fourteen times, once completely restored, paying 1 , 000 dr. from 454 / 3 to 435 / 4 , but only 500 dr. in the two following years ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 15 , 279 . ii . 86 ). They were assessed for tribute in 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . v . 19 ), 500 dr. The fact that the Pharbelians did not pay tribute after 432 may indicate that they took part in the Revolt of 432 (Thuc. 1 . 58 . 2 ), and also that they lived in the Chalkidic peninsula ( ATL i. 560 ). Steph. Byz. 658 . 15 calls Pharbelos a polis Eretrieon . Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 251 thinks that the Pharbelos mentioned by Stephanos must be a locality in Euboia and different from Pharbelos in the Chalkidic peninsula. However, Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 358 argues that Pharbelos was a colony in Chalkidike funded by Eretrians."
592,(Phegontioi),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,257,1159,"592 . (Phegontioi) Map 50 . Unlocated. Type: B:? Only the city-ethnic is known: Φεγέτιος ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 18 ), Φεγέντιος ( IG i³ 268 . iii . 9 ) or Φεγόντιος ( IG i³ 267 . ii . 27 ), all three variants known from the Athenian tribute lists. The singular of the city-ethnic ( Φε [ γόντιον ]) was restored in SEG 10 53 ( c. 430 ) but not adopted in IG i³ 159 . Since the Phegetians disappear from the tribute lists after 432 , it is possible that they revolted along with Poteidaia (no. 598 ), the Bottiaians and the Chalkidians in that year (Thuc. 1 . 58 ), and therefore, that they lived somewhere on the Chalkidic peninsula,but it cannot be determined with any certainty. The Phegetians were members of the Delian League.They belonged to the Thracian district and are recorded from 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 262 . iii . 29 ) to 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 63 ) a total of thirteen times, paying 1 , 600 dr. from 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 262 . iii . 29 ) to 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 47 ) and thereafter 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 33 ). The fact that the Phegontians did not pay tribute after 432 may indicate that they took part in the Revolt of 432 (Thuc. 1 . 58 . 2 )."

The toponym is Πίλωρος (Hdt. 7 . 122 ; IG i³ 278 . vi . 22 ). Apart from Steph. Byz. 523 . 12 , there is no attestation of a city-ethnic. At Hdt. 7 . 122 Piloros is twice called a polis , first in the urban and then in the political sense. It was a member of the Delian League, but it is listed only once,in 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 22 ), under the heading πόλεις αaspergraveς οιasper ιδιῶται ενέγραψαν φόρον φέρειν ( 18 -21 , where polis is used in the political sense),paying 600 dr.Herodotos locates it in the bay of Singos along with Ass(er)a (no. 564 ), Singos (no. 605 ) and Sarte (no. 602 ). Piloros supplied Xerxes with troops in 480 (Hdt. 7 . 122 . 1 )."

Pistasos was a member of the Delian League, but it is recorded only once: viz . in 434 / 3 under the heading πόλεις αaspergraveς οιasper ιδιῶται ενέγραψαν φόρον φέρειν ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 19 -21 , 27 , where polis is used in the political sense), paying 500 dr. In ATL i. 538 Pistasos is identified with Istasos, listed in the Thracian district in the assessment decree of 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . v . 16 ) and assessed at 50 dr. For a critical view, see Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 213 ."

The toponym is Πλευacute µ ε ( IG i³ 77 . v . 35 ). The city-ethnic is Πλευ µ ευacuteς ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 17 ).

Pleume may have been a Bottiaian polis (Flensted-Jensen ( 1995 ) 124 -25 ). It is known exclusively from the Athenian tribute lists, where it is recorded twice ( supra ), paying 1 , 000 dr. Pleume is also recorded in the assessment decree of 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . v . 35 )."
596,(Polichnitai),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,238,1115,"596 . (Polichnitai) Unlocated, not in Barr . 51 . Type: C: α . No toponym is attested. The city-ethnic is Πολιχνῖται ( IG i³ 260 . viii . 17 ). The Polichnitans were members of the Delian League. They are recorded in the first two years of the tribute lists, 454 / 3 and 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 259 . v . 11 -12 , 260 . viii . 17 ). In the first year the Polichnitans were in a syntely with Stolos (no. 614 ) and Mekyberna (no. 583 ), paying 2 tal. and 1 , 880 dr. They are also recorded (as Πολιχνῖται παραgrave Στῶλον ) in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 77 . iii . 173 -74 ). The site of the Polichnitans has been identified tentatively with modern Smixi (Hatzopoulos ( 1988 a ) 70 -72 ), where a number of deeds of sale have been found ( SEG 37 575 -76 (C4m)). The name of the month Demetrion is attested in one of them ( SEG 37 576 . 5 ). Moreover, an eponymous priest is mentioned in 575 . 2 -3 (and possibly in 576 . 3 -4 ; the name, as restored, is Euphrantides son of Aristotimos, who is mentioned in a deed of sale from Torone, SEG 24 574 . 2 , and who was perhaps a priest of the Chalkidian Federation)."
597,Posideion,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,157,785,"597 . Posideion Map 51 . Unlocated, not in Barr . Type: C:? A Posideion is known from the tribute assessment list of 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . v . 32 ). It was assessed at 1 , 000 dr. and located in the Thracian phoros ; otherwise its location is unknown. There were two places in the Chalkidic peninsula called Pos(e)ideion. One is a promontory (modern Ποσείδι ) about 4 km from Mende (and in its territory); a sanctuary of Poseidon has been found there ( supra 832 ). The other is Ποσιδήιον mentioned by Hdt. 7 . 115 . 2 between Argilos (no. 554 ) and Akanthos (no. 559 ), probably the promontory c. 20 km north of Akanthos (not in Barr .). However, Zahrnt (( 1971 ) 214 ) does not believe that this area could have supported a polis that (possibly) paid 1 , 000 dr. to the Delian League."
598,Poteidaia (Poteidaiates),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.1,23.2,1992,9463,"598 . Poteidaia (Poteidaiates) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 10 , long. 23 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Ποτείδαια , ηasper (Hdt. 8 . 126 . 3 ; Thuc. 1 . 61 . 3 ; IG i³ 268 . iii . 14 ) and later Ποτίδαια (Isoc. 15 . 108 ; Ps.-Skylax 66 ; Diod. 12 . 46 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is Ποτειδαιήτης (Hdt. 8 . 129 . 2 ), Ποτειδεάτης (Thuc. 1 . 56 . 2 ; IG i³ 272 . ii . 50 ), Ποτειδαιάτης (ML 27 . 9 (the Serpent Column); Diod. 12 . 46 . 6 ) or Ποτειδαευacuteς ( IG ii² 10109 (C4m)). Poteidaia is called a polis both in the urban sense (Thuc. 1 . 62 . 1 ; Aen. Tact. 31 . 25 ; Ps.Skylax 66 ) and in the political sense (Thuc. 1 . 66 ; Isoc. 15 . 108 ; SEG 38 662 . 4 (C4f)). The collective city-ethnic is used internally (in abbreviated form) on C5 -C4 coins ( infra ), and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 50 ). The individual and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in a C4m sepulchral inscription from Attika ( IG ii² 10109 ). At Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 39 the toponym ηasper Ποτείδαια denotes the territory of Poteidaia. Thuc. 1 . 64 . 2 mentions that the territory ( ge ) of Poteidaia was ravaged by Phormion.Although Poteidaia was one of the most important poleis on the Chalkidic peninsula, its territory cannot have been larger than c. 65 km ² , since Olynthos (no. 588 ) was situated c. 11 km to the north, and Aphytis (no. 563 ) and Sane (no. 600 ) c. 14 and 15 km respectively to the south of it. Furthermore, the isthmus of Pallene is 900 m wide (Strabo 7 fr. 25 ) at its narrowest. Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 locates Poteidaia on Pallene next to Aphytis.Thuc. 1 . 56 . 2 and Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 15 place it on the isthmus of Pallene. Poteidaia was colonised from Corinth (no. 227 ) (Thuc. 1 . 56 . 2 , 66 . 1 ), and according to Nikolaos of Damaskos ( FGrHist 90 ) fr. 59 , the oecist was Euagoras, son of Periandros. Thus, it was probably founded c. 600 . Annual magistrates called επιδη µ ιουργοί were still sent from Corinth to Poteidaia in C5s (Thuc. 1 . 56 . 2 ), but there is no evidence that Poteidaia was ruled from Corinth (Graham ( 1964 ) 135 -37 ). Poteidaia sent donations to Delphi in C6l ( Syll . ³ 15 ; Alexander ( 1963 ) 29 -30 ), where it also had a treasury (Paus. 10 . 11 . 5 ; Alexander ( 1963 ) 25 -29 ; Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 140 -41 ). Poteidaia supplied troops and ships to Xerxes in 480 (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 ). Furthermore, it had 300 hoplites at Plataiai (Hdt. 9 . 28 . 3 ; ML 27 . 9 (the Serpent Column); see Alexander ( 1963 ) 34 -35 ; Paus. 5 . 23 . 2 Arist. Rh . 1396 a 20 ). Apparently Poteidaia entered into an alliance with the other towns of Pallene against the Persians in 479 (Hdt. 8 . 128 . 2 ). Poteidaia was a member of the Delian League (Thuc. 1 . 56 . 2 , 1 . 66 ). It was probably a member from the very beginning (it is recorded on the Serpent Column; see e.g. Sealey ( 1966 ) 243 ), but it does not appear in the tribute lists until 446 / 5 ( IG i³ 266 . iii . 7 ). Alexander ( 1963 ) 41 -42 suggests that Poteidaia supplied a quota of ships and only later a quota of tribute. After 446 / 5 Poteidaia occurs regularly in the lists until 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 70 ) a total of eleven times, twice completely restored.Poteidaia belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded sometimes by toponym ( IG i³ 268 . iii . 14 ), sometimes by city-ethnic ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 50 ), paying a phoros of 6 tal. down to 440 / 39 ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 50 ), but 15 tal. in 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 70 ). It revolted in 432 along with the Chalkidians and the Bottiaians (Thuc. 1 . 58 . 2 ), and consequently it is not recorded in the complete panels of 432 / 1 and 430 / 29 . However, it appears from Thuc. 4 . 120 . 3 that it belonged to the Athenians in 423 . In 432 , the Athenians requested that Poteidaia demolish part of its city wall, give hostages and refuse to accept the epidemiourgoi from Corinth ( supra ). Poteidaia sent envoys to Athens and Sparta simultaneously, and then countered the Athenian request by entering into an alliance with the Bottiaians and the Chalkidians and revolting against the Athenians (Thuc. 1 . 56 -58 ). Poteidaia was besieged by the Athenians from 432 until 430 (Thuc. 1 . 59 -67 , 2 . 58 ; Pl. Chrm . 153 A-B), when it capitulated (Thuc. 2 . 70 . 1 -3 ). The inhabitants left Poteidaia and went to Chalkidike and other places (Thuc. 2 . 70 . 4 ; cf. Diod. 12 . 46 . 6 ). The Athenians settled Poteidaia with 1 , 000 klerouchs (ML 66 : εποίκον ες Ποτείδαιαν ; Thuc. 2 . 70 . 4 ; Diod. 12 . 46 . 7 ), who in IG i³ 62 . 8 , 20 are referred to as οιasper έποικοι οιasper Αθηναίων οιasper Ποτείδαιαν έχοντες . In 423 there is evidence of stasis in Poteidaia (Thuc. 4 . 121 . 2 ), but Brasidas' attempt to conquer the city failed (Thuc. 4 . 135 . 1 ). According to Xen. Hell . 5 . 2 . 15 , 24 , Poteidaia was a member of the Chalkidian Federation in the 380 s. In 364 / 3 Timotheos captured Poteidaia (and Torone (no. 620 )) from the Chalkidian Federation (Isoc. 15 . 108 , 113 ; Din. 1 . 14 , 3 . 17 ; Diod. 15 . 81 . 6 ). Some pro-Athenian Poteidaians sent envoys to Athens to ask for additional settlers, and in 362 / 1 Poteidaia became once again a klerouchy ( IG ii² 114 = Tod 146 ) settled with a contingent called Αθηναῖοι οιasper εν ΠοτειδαίΩsubiotaα κατοικουtildeντες (Dem. 7 . 10 ). In 356 Philip forced Poteidaia to surrender to the Olynthians (no. 588 ) (Dem. 6 . 20 , 7 . 10 , 23 . 107 -8 ; cf. Diod. 16 . 8 . 3 -5 ). Philip let the Athenians leave Poteidaia, but exposed the Poteidaians to an andrapodismos : they were sold off as slaves, and the town and territory given to the Olynthians (Diod. 16 . 8 . 5 ). However, the city was not destroyed by Philip (Alexander ( 1963 ) 91 , pace West ( 1918 ) 133 n. 137 ). It appears from Dem. 20 . 61 that Poteidaia was still in existence in 355 and was now a Makedonian dependency. The presumption is that the town was given to a new stock of settlers, probably Olynthians (Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 361 ). Paus. 5 . 23 . 2 says that the Poteidaians were forced to leave their town twice, first under the Athenians, then under Philip. Kassandros brought them back to Poteidaia c. 316 , but changed the name of the town to Kassandreia (Diod. 19 . 52 . 2 ). We have no information about the status of Poteidaia in the years 356 -316 . Poteidaia may have had an oligarchic constitution,at least until 433 (Rhodes ( 1981 ) 299 ). There is no evidence of civic subdivisions in Poteidaia, apart from Athenian tribes and demes from the time of the first klerouchy ( AAA 7 ( 1974 ) 190 -98 ; Jones, POAG 266 -67 ). Being an Athenian klerouchy once again from 361 to 356 , Poteidaia is recorded in the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi of, probably, 360 / 59 ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 12 ) and functioned as a (dependent) polis as is attested in a proxeny decree dated to the years 359 -357 (Hatzopoulos ( 1988 b ) 55 -61 = SEG 38 662 ). The inscription was found in Ag. Mamas (between Olynthos and Poteidaia) and Hatzopoulos believes that it comes from Poteidaia rather than Olynthos. If that is so, there is evidence of a boule (l. 7 ), an ekklesia (l. 8 , heavily restored) and a tamias (l. 16 ), and the community is twice referred to as a polis in the political sense (ll. 4 , 13 ). Thuc. 1 . 56 . 2 mentions the city walls of Poteidaia. Alexander ( 1963 ) 3 writes that 'traces of ancient wall construction, apparently classical, were reported to have been found' , and during recent excavations parts of the C5 walls have been found along with C6sherds ( ArchDelt 40 ( 1985 ) Chron . 237 -38 ; 41 ( 1986 ) Chron . 147 ; Sismanides and Karaïskou ( 1992 ) 485 , 489 ; Koussoulakou ( 1997 ) 457 -58 ). Poteidaia must have been strongly fortified: in 479 it was able to withstand a siege for three months (Hdt. 8 . 126 -28 ; cf. Aen. Tact. 31 . 25 -27 and Polyaen. 7 . 33 . 1 ), and from 432 it was besieged by the Athenians for 2½ years (Thuc. 2 . 70 ). Not much of ancient Poteidaia is left; much material has been employed in later constructions (Alexander ( 1963 ) 1 -7 ; cf. Gomme ( 1945 ) 199 ). Two passages in Thucydides suggest that Poteidaia had two harbours, one to the east and one to the west (Thuc. 1 . 63 , 4 . 129 ; cf. Alexander ( 1963 ) 19 ). At some point in Antiquity there may have been a canal through the isthmus on which Poteidaia was situated. Strabo says that the isthmus of Pallene is διορωρυγ µ ένος ( 7 fr. 25 ). Hdt. 7 . 22 mentions the canal on Athos, but he does not mention any canal on Pallene, so it may have been dug later. There was a temple of Poseidon in the proasteion of Poteidaia in 479 (Hdt. 8 . 129 . 3 ; Thuc. 4 . 129 . 3 ). IG iv 673 is a C4 honorific inscription for a Nauplian victor in athletic contests. The name of Poteidaia is restored in line 6 , and if the restoration is correct, this is the only known example of games held in Poteidaia. Poteidaia struck silver coins on the Euboic standard from c. 550 (Alexander ( 1953 ), ( 1963 ) 50 ), C6l (Gaebler ( 1935 ) 103 -5 ; Robinson and Clement ( 1938 ) 307 ; SNG Cop. Macedonia 312 -316 ), or c. 500 (Head, HN ² 212 ) until c. 356 . Denominations: tetradrachms, tetrobols, diobols and tritemoria. ( 1 ) c. 500 -429 : types: obv .

Others have female head on the obv ., a sitting bull and legend on the rev . Poteidaia struck bronze coins in C4 as well."
599,Prassilos (Prassilios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,93,453,"599 . Prassilos (Prassilios) Unlocated. Type: B:? The toponym is Πράσσιλος ( IG i³ 285 . iii . 10 ). Steph. Byz. 534 . 11 has Πράξιλος (and the city-ethnic Πραξίλιος ). The city-ethnic is restored [ Πρα ] σσίλιος in a C4m inscription ( SEG 40 542 . 28 ). Prassilos may have been located in Bottike (FlenstedJensen ( 1995 ) 124 ). Prassilos was a member of the Delian League,but it is listed only once, in 421 / 0 ( IG i³ 285 . iii . 10 ), paying 900 dr."
600,Sane (Sanaios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.2,23.55,565,2691,"600 . Sane (Sanaios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 20 , long. 23 . 55 . Size of territory: 2 or 3 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Σάνη , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 22 ). The city-ethnic is Σαναῖος ( IG i³ 260 . viii . 19 ). Hdt. 7 . 22 . 3 calls Sane a Hellenic polis ( πόλις ' Ελλάς ), using polis in the urban sense, whereas Thuc. 4 . 109 . 3 -5 probably uses polis in the political sense, using polisma about the settlement. The collective city-ethnic is used externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 260 . viii . 19 ). In C5Sane was considered a colony from Andros (no. 475 ) (Thuc. 4 . 109 . 3 ). Plutarch ( Mor . 298 A), however, says that Sane was settled jointly by the Chalkidians (no. 365 ) and the Andrians. Sane was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 25 , completely restored) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . iii . 12 ) a total of nineteen times, four times completely restored, paying a phoros of 4 , 000 dr. from 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 100 ) to 442 / 1 ( IG i³ 270 . iii . 6 ). From 435 / 4 ( IG i³ 277 . vi . 27 ) to 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 74 ) it paid 1 tal., and in 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 27 ) just 1 , 000 dr. It is universally accepted that the Sane recorded in the tribute lists is Sane on Athos. But an inspection of its position in the tribute lists shows that it may equally well be Sane (no. 601 ) on Pallene, thus Hansen ( 2004 ). Sane withstood an attack from Brasidas in 424 , but its territory was ravaged (Thuc. 4 . 109 . 5 ). The incident indicates that Sane was fortified. Sane is mentioned in the Peace of Nikias (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 6 ). The passage runs as follows: Μηκυβερναίους δεgrave καιgrave Σαναίους καιgrave Σιγγαίους οικεῖν ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς /asper εαυτῶν , καθάπερ ' Ολυacuteνθιοι καιgrave Ακάνθιοι . This may be interpreted to mean that the Mekybernaians (no. 583 ), the Sanaians and the Singaians (no. 605 ) are to live in their own poleis , the Mekybernaians and the Singaians independently of Olynthos (no. 588 ), and the Sanaians independently of Akanthos (no. 559 ) (Gomme ( 1956 ) 672 ; cf. Hornblower ( 1996 ) 478 -79 ). Others want to emend the passage and write Γαλαίους instead of Σαναίους (West ( 1937 b ) 166 -73 , accepted by e.g. Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 220 ). Sane may have been incorporated into Ouranopolis, which was founded by Alexarchos c. 315 (Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 209 -10 ), or perhaps into Akanthos,since it is not mentioned by later sources. South-west of modern Nea Rhoda (in the territory of Sane?) an Archaic sanctuary has been found. The sanctuary was in use from the Archaic period to C3 (Vokotopoulou and Tsigarida ( 1992 ), ( 1993 ); Tsigarida ( 1996 ))."
601,Sane,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.05,23.2,309,1522,"601 . Sane Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 05 , long. 23 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Σάνη , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is not attested. At 7 . 123 . 1 Herodotos uses the pronoun αυaspertildeται about eight poleis on Pallene, and it is an almost certain inference that the noun to be supplied is πόλεις . He mentions Sane after Mende (no. 584 ) and locates it on Pallene. Furthermore, he says that it supplied ships and troops to Xerxes in 480 . West ( 1918 ) 73 argues that Sane at Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 must be an error and that Sane on Pallene would have been distinguished from Sane (no. 600 ) on Akte, in, e.g., the Peace of Nikias (see also Gomme ( 1956 ) 588 ). This argument carries no weight; see supra 839 . Furthermore,according to Strabo ( 7 fr. 27 ) Sane was one of four poleis on Pallene. Pomponius Mela ( 2 . 3 . 35 ) mentions Sane too. Finally, Geometric and Archaic remains of a considerable settlement have been found on some hills near modern Sani, c. 15 km south of Poteidaia (no. 598 ) ( ArchDelt 41 ( 1986 ) Chron . 147 , 42 ( 1987 ) Chron . 367 -68 ; Vokotopoulou ( 1987 ) 279 ). The fact that some Archaic sherds are inscribed in the Corinthian alphabet ( SEG 38 667 ) may indicate Corinthian influence, possibly via nearby Poteidaia, at Sane; these sherds seem to originate from the site of a nocturnal cult of a female chthonic deity (ibid.). It cannot be precluded that the Sane recorded in the Athenian tribute lists is Sane on Pallene, not Sane (no. 600 ) on Athos."
602,Sarte (Sartaios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.05,24.0,322,1352,"602 . Sarte (Sartaios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 05 , long. 24 . 00 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: α . The toponym is Σάρτη (Hdt. 7 . 122 ). The city-ethnic is Σαρταῖος ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 57 ). At Hdt. 7 . 122 Sarte is twice called a polis , first in the urban sense; but the information that Sarte was one of the poleis that supplied Xerxes with troops in 480 indicates that polis is used in the political sense as well. In the Athenian tribute lists Sarte is recorded three times under the heading πόλεις ( infra ), where polis is used in the political sense. The collective cityethnic is used externally in the tribute lists (e.g. IG i³ 281 . iii . 57 ). Hdt. 7 . 122 locates Sarte on the bay of Singos and says that it supplied troops to Xerxes in 480 . Sarte was a member of the Delian League.It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 13 ), 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 79 ) and in 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . ii . 71 ) under the heading πόλεις αυταιgrave φόρον ταξά µ εναι , in 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 57 ) and in 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 38 ) under the heading ταῖσδε έταξαν οιasper τάκται επιgrave Κρ [. . .] ου γρα µµ ατευacuteοντος . It is also on the lists of 421 / 0 ( IG i³ 285 . iii . 12 ) and 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . iii . 11 ), paying 1 , 500 dr. from 434 / 3 to 429 / 8 , but only 100 dr. in 421 / 0 ."
603,Serme (Sermaios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,226,970,"603 . Serme (Sermaios) Not in Barr 50 . Unlocated. Type: C:? The toponym is Σέρ µ ε ( IG i³ 77 .V. 20 ). The city-ethnic is Σερ µ ευacuteς ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 34 ) or Σερ µ αῖος ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 48 ). It is restored as Σερ µ αιευacuteς in the tribute lists of 443 / 2 ( IG i³ 269 . iii . 33 ) and 442 / 1 ( IG i³ 270 . iii . 32 ). The collective cityethnic is used externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 34 ). The editors of the Athenian tribute lists suggest that the Sermaians were the inhabitants of Therme (Hdt. 7 . 124 ), but most scholars disagree ( ATL i. 546 , contra e.g. Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 223 -25 ). The Sermaians were members of the Delian League.They belonged to the Thracian district and are recorded in the tribute lists from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 14 ) to 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . ii . 57 ) a total of fourteen times, twice completely restored, paying 500 dr. They were assessed for tribute in 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . v . 20 ) 500 dr."
604,Sermylia (Sermylieus),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.15,23.3,741,3331,"604 . Sermylia (Sermylieus) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 15 , long. 23 . 30 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Σερ µ υacuteλη (Hdt. 7 . 122 ) or Σερ µ υλία ( IG i³ 1184 . i . 50 ; Ps.Skylax 66 ). The city-ethnic is Σερ µ υλιευacuteς ( IG i³ 277 . vi . 26 ), Σερβυλιευacuteς ( IG i³ 264 . iv . 34 ) and ΣΕΡΜΥΛΙΑΙΟΝ on Archaic coins (Gaebler ( 1935 ) 106 -7 ). Sermylia is called a polis both in the urban sense (Thuc. 1 . 65 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 66 (cf. Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 )) and in the political sense (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 8 : Peace of Nikias). At Hdt. 7 . 122 polis is used in both senses simultaneously (Hansen ( 2000 a ) 175 -76 ). Hecat. fr. 151 ( apud Steph. Byz. 561 . 14 ) mentioned Sermylia, although it is not certain whether he called it a polis (cf. Hansen ( 1997 b )). The collective city-ethnic is used internally on coins of c. 500 (Gaebler ( 1935 ) 106 -7 ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 270 . iii . 27 ). Hdt. 7 . 122 lists Sermylia between Gale(psos) (no. 571 ) and Mekyberna (no. 583 ); Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 225 mentions an ancient settlement c. 3 km south of modern Ormylia. The name of Sermylia's territory was Σερ µ υλιαία ( SEG 38 619 . 6 ( c. 285 )). Sermylia supplied Xerxes with troops and ships in 480 (Hdt. 7 . 122 ). Sermylia was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . v . 9 ) to 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . v . 9 ) a total of thirteen times, once completely restored. In 445 / 4 it is recorded as Σερ µ υλιηtildeς καιgrave συν ( IG i³ 267 . ii . 25 ; see West ( 1918 ) 12 n. 20 ). In the first years it paid odd sums such as 4 , 622 dr. in 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . v . 9 ), 3 , 550 dr. in 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 262 . ii . 28 ). In 448 / 7 and 447 / 6 it paid 3 tal. ( IG i³ 264 . iv . 34 , 265 . ii . 29 ). From 445 / 4 it paid 5 tal. ( IG i³ 267 . ii . 25 ), and from 435 / 4 4½ tal. ( IG i³ 277 . vi . 26 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 165 , completely restored). In 432 the Peloponnesians under Aristeus killed many Sermyliaians near their polis , and, since he helped the Chalkidians, they must have been enemies of the Chalkidians (Thuc. 1 . 65 . 2 ). Nevertheless, the Chalkidians must have secured control of Sermylia shortly after, since they do not appear in the complete panels of the tribute lists of 432 / 1 and 430 / 29 . However, it appears from the Peace of Nikias (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 8 ) that Sermylia was once again in the hands of the Athenians. It seems reasonable to infer that Sermylia was a member of the Chalkidian Federation in C4 (Zahrnt ( 1971 ) map 4 ), and that it was one of the poleis annihilated by Philip II,since there is no mention of Sermylia after 348 . Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 121 suggests that it became a kome of Kassandreia. Around 285 some land in the territory of (the former polis ?) Sermylia was given to Limnaios by Lysimachos (Hatzopoulos ( 1988 b ) 37 ; cf. SEG 38 619 ). Sermylia struck silver tetradrachms on the Euboic standard c. 500 (Head, HN ² 207 ; cf. Gaebler ( 1935 ) 106 -7 ) or perhaps as early as the third quarter of C6 (Robinson and Clement ( 1938 ) 313 ). Types: obv . naked horseman and dog; legend: ΣΕΡΜΥΛΙΚΟΝ or ΣΕΡΜΥΛΙΑΙΟΝ ; rev . quadripartite incuse square. A few C4 bronze coins have been found (ibid. 313 )."
605,Singos (Singaios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.15,23.45,408,1837,"605 . Singos (Singaios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 15 , long. 23 . 45 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: α . The toponym is Σίγγος (Hdt. 7 . 122 ). The city-ethnic is Σίγγιος ( IG i³ 260 . viii . 18 ) or Σιγγαῖος (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 6 ). Singos is called a polis at Hdt. 7 . 122 in the urban and political senses simultaneously (Hansen ( 2000 a ) 175 -76 ) and in the political sense at Thuc. 5 . 18 . 8 (Peace of Nikias).The collective city-ethnic is used externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 260 . viii . 18 ). Singos supplied Xerxes with troops in 480 (Hdt. 7 . 122 ). It was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . v . 13 ) to 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 75 ) a total of sixteen times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of between 1 tal. ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 75 ) and 4 tal. ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 11 ). Singos was assessed for tribute of 10 dr. in 421 ( IG i³ 77 . v . 22 ), and possibly in 425 / 4 too ( IG i³ 71 . iv . 109 , completely restored). In the Peace of Nikias it is stipulated that the inhabitants of Singos live in their own polis (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 6 ), which probably means that Singos was one of the poleis that took part in the synoecism of Olynthos (no. 588 ) in 432 (Thuc. 1 . 58 . 2 ; see West ( 1918 ) 74 and Hornblower ( 1996 ) 478 -79 ); the wording of Thuc. 1 . 58 . 2 ( πόλεις . . . καταβαλόντας and καθαιρουtildeντες ταgraveς πόλεις ) suggests that the city was destroyed in connection with the synoecism.Perhaps Singos was one of the towns destroyed by Philip II, since Strabo calls it a πόλις αρχαία κατεσκα µµ ένη ( 7 fr. 31 ). Remains of the urban centre and its harbour have been found near modern Ag. Nikolaos; the urban centre was protected by a wall of the Classical or Heltic period (Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 227 -28 )."
606,Sinos,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.15,23.45,243,1016,"606 . Sinos Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 15 , long. 23 . 45 . Size of territory: ? Type: [A]:? Only the toponym Σίνος ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 24 ) is attested. In the Athenian tribute lists Sinos is twice recorded under the heading πόλεις αasperacuteς οιasper ιδιῶται ενέγραψαν φόρον φέρειν , in 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 18 -21 , 24 ) and in 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 89 -92 , 98 , restored), where polis is used in the political sense. The name of the territory, Σιναία , is mentioned in Syll . ³ 332 ( 306 -297 ), according to which a field in the Sinaia was given by Kassandros to Perdikkas. Sinos may have been situated in Bottike (Flensted-Jensen ( 1995 ) 125 ). Sinos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists for the years 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 24 ), 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 98 ) and 421 / 0 ( IG i³ 285 . iii . 9 ), paying 1 , 500 dr. in 434 / 3 and 433 / 2 and 800 dr. in 421 / 0 . Furthermore, it was assessed in 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . v . 38 )."
607,Skabala (Skablaios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,318,1408,"607 . Skabala (Skablaios) Map 51 . 40 . 20 , long. 23 . 35 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: α . The toponym is presumably Σκάβαλα (Theopomp. fr. 151 ; cf. Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 358 with n. 49 ). The city-ethnic is Σκαβλαῖος ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 16 ). The collective city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 259 . v . 6 -7 ). Theopomp. fr. 151 describes Skabala as a χωρίον ' Ερετριέων , which indicates that he took it to be a colony of Eretria (Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 358 with n. 49 ). The Skablaians were members of the Delian League.They are recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . v . 6 -7 ) to 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 71 ) a total of fourteen times,once completely restored. In the first year ( IG i³ 259 . v . 6 -7 ( 454 / 3 )) they appear in a syntelic group along with Olynthos (no. 588 ) and Ass(er)a (no. 564 ), paying 2 tal., 4 , 000 dr. altogether. When the Skablaians are listed alone, they pay either 3 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 16 ) or 2 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 25 ) or, once, 1 , 500 dr. ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 71 ). Since they are absent from the full panel of 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 5 -27 ), many scholars believe that the Skablaians revolted in 432 (Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 231 ). This, and the fact that they paid along with Olynthos and Ass(er)a, led the editors of the Athenian tribute lists to believe that the Skablaians lived north of Sithonia ( ATL i. 549 )."
608,(Skapsaioi),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,215,1034,"608 . (Skapsaioi) Unlocated.Type: B: α ? The city-ethnic is Σκαφσαῖος ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 49 ). The abbreviated collective city-ethnic is used internally on C4f coins ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 290 . iii . 13 ). The Skapsaians were members of the Delian League. They belonged to the Thracian district and are recorded in the tribute lists from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . ii . 6 , heavily restored) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . iii . 13 ) a total of fourteen times, once completely restored. However,they are not listed in the complete panel of 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 5 -27 ), which may indicate that they took part in the Revolt of 432 (Thuc. 1 . 58 . 2 ). If so, they must have joined the Athenians again at some point before 415 . The Skapsaians paid a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. During the excavations at Olynthos a Skapsaian bronze coin was found.It dates from C4f. Type: obv . head of Apollo; rev . lion (or panther); legend: ΣΚΑΨΑΙ (Robinson ( 1952 ) 407 -8 , 419 ; Flensted-Jensen ( 1997 ) 122 -25 )."
609,Skione (Skionaios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,39.55,23.35,1118,5333,"609 . Skione (Skionaios) Map 51 . Lat. 39 . 55 , long. 23 . 35 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Σκιώνη , ηasper (Thuc. 4 . 120 . 2 ) or Σκιώνα ( IG iv² . 1 i .b. 94 . 25 ( 359 )). The city-ethnic is Σκιωναῖος (Thuc. 4 . 120 . 1 ; IG i³ 266 . ii . 31 ). Skione is called a polis both in the urban sense (Thuc. 4 . 131 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 66 , where it is listed under the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε ) and in the political sense (Hdt. 8 . 128 . 3 ; Thuc. 4 . 122 . 4 , 5 . 18 . 8 : Peace of Nikias). Thuc. 5 . 2 . 1 once describes Skione as a chorion in Thrace. The collective city-ethnic is used internally on C5f coins (Head, HN ² 210 ), and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 31 ). The individual and external use is attested in Attic sepulchral inscriptions ( IG ii² 10365 -66 (C4 )) and in literary sources (Hdt. 8 . 8 . 1 ). Hdt. 7 . 123 , locates Skione between Therambos (no. 616 ) and Mende (no. 584 ) on Pallene (cf. Thuc. 4 . 120 . 1 ). Skione supplied troops and ships to Xerxes in 480 (Hdt. 7 . 123 ). Hdt. 8 . 128 . 1 -3 mentions a strategos from Skione in reference to 479 . Skione was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the Athenian tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 9 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 12 ) a total of fourteen times. In the years 454 / 3 -451 / 0 Skione and Therambos (no. 616 ) paid jointly 6 tal. ( IG i³ 262 . i . 3 ); in the following period Skione paid 6 tal. ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 31 ) until 432 / 1 , when the tribute was lowered to 4 tal. ( IG i³ 280 . ii . 52 ), but in 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 14 ) and in 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 12 ) it paid 9 tal. Skione joined Brasidas in 423 (Thuc. 4 . 120 -21 ; cf. Diod. 12 . 72 . 1 ), just after Athens and Sparta had concluded an armistice for a year (Thuc. 4 . 117 -19 ). Therefore, on the motion of Kleon, the Athenians decreed that Skione be destroyed and the inhabitants killed (Thuc. 4 . 122 . 6 ). Having captured Mende, the Athenians laid siege to Skione and built a wall round the city (Thuc. 4 . 130 . 7 -132 . 1 , 133 . 4 , 5 . 2 . 2 ; Ar. Vesp . 210 ). In the Peace of Nikias Skione is ceded to Athens (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 7 -8 ). Shortly after, the Athenians captured Skione and exposed the city to andrapodismos : the adult males were killed, the women and the children enslaved, and the land given to the Plataians (Thuc. 5 . 32 . 1 ; Isoc. 4 . 109 )-in later sources described as a harsh treatment (Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 3 ; Isoc. 4 . 100 ). In 405 / 4 Lysander gave Skione back to its former inhabitants (Plut. Lys . 14 . 3 ; cf. Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 3 , 9 ). Skione is recorded in the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi of 360 / 59 ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 25 ). Meritt ( 1923 ) 450 -51 offers a description of the site of Skione. He located the acropolis of Skione on a fortified hill (p. 447 ) from which C4 remains of a building have been reported ( ArchDelt 41 ( 1986 ) Chron . 149 ), and later excavations have revealed remains of, inter alia , a large C5 building, built in isodomic masonry (Sismanides ( 1991 )). The Skionaians believed that, originally, they came from Pellene in the Peloponnese. The first settlers were driven by a storm on their way back from Troy (Thuc. 4 . 120 . 1 ; cf. Polyaen. 7 . 47 ). Borza ( 1990 ) 75 suggests that Achaians settled at Skione. This tradition is undoubtedly an attempt to connect Peloponnesian Pellene with Thracian Pallene, on which Skione was located. An Archaic coin testifies to a different tradition: on the obverse Protesilaos is celebrated as the oecist of Skione (Kraay ( 1976 ) 134 with no. 470 ). The two traditions are not mutually exclusive: 'Protesilaos the 'Achaian' (in the broad Homeric sense) is easily reconcilable with the story of a foundation from Achaia (in the narrow geographical sense of Achaia, i.e. northern Peloponnese)' (Hornblower ( 1996 ) 377 -78 ). Skione was considered an Achaian colony by later writers: Pomponius Mela 2 . 33 and Polyaen. 7 . 47 both say that Skione was founded by Achaians escaping from Troy, whereas Konon ( 13 = Phot. 133 a) attributes the foundation of Skione to Protesilaos. However, it was well known that Protesilaos was killed as soon as he arrived at Troy (Hom. Il. 2 . 698 -702 ). Various solutions to this problem have been suggested: Protesilaos participated in the first expedition against Troy (with Herakles) and founded Skione after that expedition (Hornblower ( 1996 ) 377 with refs.); or there may have been an alternative tradition according to which Protesilaos did not die when he arrived at Troy, and thus was able to found Skione (Boedeker ( 1988 ) 36 n. 22 ). Skione struck silver coins on the Euboic standard from C6l to c. 450 , and on the Phoenician standard before c. 424 .

610,Skithai (Skithaios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,147,768,"610 . Skithai (Skithaios) Not in Barr . Unlocated. Type: B: α . The toponym is Σκίθαι (Steph. Byz. 574 . 17 ). The cityethnic is Σκιθαῖος (Theopomp. fr. 375 ), ΣΚΙΘ ( ΑΙΟ ) Ν found on coins ( SNG Cop.Macedonia 325 ). Steph.Byz. 574 . 17 describes Skithai as a polis in Thrace, in the vicinity of Poteidaia ( πλησίον Ποτιδαίας ). Since he calls Skithai a polis in Thrace, not in Makedonia, he probably used a pre-350 source. Skithai is sometimes identified with Kithas (s.v.; Gaebler ( 1929 ) 256 ; but see Flensted-Jensen ( 1997 ) 125 -27 ). Skithai minted silver coins c. 500 . Denominations: tetrobols and hemiobols. Types: obv . lion; legend: ΣΚΙΘ or ΣΚΙΘ ( ΑΙΟ ) Ν ; rev . Quadripartite incuse square (Gaebler ( 1929 ), ( 1935 ) 110 ; SNG Cop. Macedonia 325 -26 )."
611,Smila,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,233,984,"611 . Smila Map 50 . Unlocated. Type: A:? The toponym is Σ µ ίλα (Hecat. fr. 148 ; Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 ) or Σ µ ίλλα ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 31 ). Apart from Steph. Byz. 580 . 10 , there is no attestation of a city-ethnic. Smila is called a polis in the urban sense by Hecat. fr. 148 (Hansen ( 1997 b ) 25 ), and in the urban and political sense combined (Hansen ( 2000 a ) 175 -76 ) by Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 -3 . In an Athenian tribute list Smila is recorded under the heading πόλεις αaspergraveς οιasper ιδιῶται ενέγραψαν φόρον φέρειν ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 18 -21 , 31 ), where polis is used in the political sense. Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 -3 locates Smila in Krousis. Smila supplied Xerxes with troops in 480 (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 2 ). It was a member of the Delian League, but is listed only once, in 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . ii . 31 ), paying 3 , 000 dr. along with the Tindaians (no. 619 ), Kithas (no. 579 ), Gigonos (no. 572 ) and Haisa (no. 573 ). [ Σ µ ίλλα ] is restored in IG i³ 71 . iv . 84 ( 425 / 4 )."
612,Spartolos (Spartolios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.2,23.1,509,2373,"612 . Spartolos (Spartolios) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 20 ; long. 23 . 10 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: α . The toponym is Σπάρτωλος , ηasper (Thuc. 2 . 79 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is Σπαρτόλιος ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 24 ). Spartolos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Thuc. 2 . 79 . 2 ) and in the political sense (Thuc. 2 . 79 . 2 , 5 . 18 . 5 : Peace of Nikias). The collective city-ethnic is used externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 24 ). Spartolos was a polis in Bottike (Thuc. 2 . 79 . 2 ; Harp. Σ 34 ). The name of its territory was probably also Σπάρτωλος ( Syll . ³ 332 . 15 -16 ( 306 -297 ); cf. Flensted-Jensen ( 1995 ) 125 ). Spartolos was a member of the Delian League until the beginning of the Peloponnesian War. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 24 ) to 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . v . 5 ) a total of sixteen times, once completely restored, paying 2 tal. each year, except in 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . v . 5 ) and 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 73 ), when it paid 3 tal. 500 dr. In 432 the Bottiaians revolted against the Athenians (Thuc. 1 . 57 . 5 ), and in 429 they fought and won a battle against the Athenians outside Spartolos (Thuc. 2 . 79 . 2 -7 ; Isae. 5 . 42 ; Flensted-Jensen ( 1995 ) 121 -22 ). Spartolos may have been listed in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 167 : Σπ [ αρτόλιοι ]). According to the Peace of Nikias, Spartolos was to be autonomos and pay the tribute as fixed by Aristeides (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 5 ). A C4m deed of sale has been found at the presumed site of Spartolos (Papangelos ( 1996 )). The inscription indicates that Spartolos was a member of the Chalkidian Federation at that time, since Aristoboulos, son of Kallikrates (ll. 1 -2 ), was a priest of the Chalkidian Federation, perhaps in 353 / 2 (Hatzopoulos ( 1988 a ) 59 , 67 , 73 -75 ). It appears from Thuc. 2 . 79 that Spartolos was walled. At the presumed site of Spartolos there are remains of a cemetery containing graves from the Archaic and Classical periods and of a settlement. Furthermore, excavations at Nea Syllata, c. 3 km from ancient Spartolos,show continuous habitation from the Bronze Age, through the Classical, Roman and Byzantine periods ( ArchDelt 31 ( 1976 ) Chron . 247 ); also a cemetery has been found at Nea Syllata ( AAA 14 ( 1982 ) 246 -50 )."
613,Stagiros (Stagirites),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.35,23.45,1200,5832,"613 . Stagiros (Stagirites) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 35 , long. 23 . 45 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: α . The older toponym is Στάγιρος (Hdt. 7 . 115 . 2 ; Thuc. 4 . 88 . 2 ) or Στάγιρα ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 21 ( 360 / 59 )), and the later one is Στάγειρα , τά (Dion. Hal. Ad Amm . 1 . 5 ) or Στάγειρος (Strabo 7 fr. 33 (but note Στάγειρα , fr. 35 )). The city-ethnic is Σταγιρίτης ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 53 ), and later Σταγειρίτης (Diod. 18 . 8 . 3 ; Dio Chrys. 47 . 9 ). Herodotos calls Stagiros a polis in the urban sense ( πόλις ' Ελλάς : 7 . 115 . 2 ), and Thucydides in the political sense ( 5 . 18 . 5 : Peace of Nikias). The collective city-ethnic is found internally in abbreviated form on C6l coins ( infra ), and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 18 ). The individual city-ethnic is used externally on a gravestone from Athens ( IG i³ 1370 (C5s)) and in Syll . ³ 275 ( 334 -332 ). According to early tradition, Stagiros was a colony from Andros (Thuc. 4 . 88 . 2 , 5 . 6 . 1 ), but Dion. Hal. Ad Amm . 1 . 5 seems to believe that it was founded from Chalkis (no. 365 ). Hdt. 7 . 115 . 2 mentions Stagiros in connection with Xerxes' march in 480 . Stagiros was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . i . 14 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 10 ) a total of fifteen times, once completely restored, paying 1 , 000 dr. in all years ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 15 ). In 424 Stagiros revolted and joined Brasidas (Thuc. 4 . 88 . 2 ), and in 422 Kleon made an unsuccessful attack on the city (Thuc. 5 . 6 . 1 ). In the Peace of Nikias Stagiros is declared autonomos and liable to the tribute assessed by Aristeides (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 5 ). It was assessed for tribute in 410 / 9 (Krateros fr. 25 (Krech 1888 ) = IG i³ 100 ). If we can trust some late sources (Tzetzes, Chil . 7 . 441 , 11 . 849 ; Dio Chrys. 47 . 9 ), Stagiros had been a polis (or kome ) in Olynthian territory, i.e. a member of the Chalkidic Federation (Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 242 -43 ). According to an emended passage in Diod. 16 . 52 . 9 and two passages from Vit . Arist . (fr. 655 , Rose), Stagiros was destroyed by Philip in 348 (see Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 376 and Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 191 ). It is not clear from Plut. Alex . 7 . 2 and Dio Chrys. 47 . 9 whether the town was in fact destroyed; what is clear is that the population was expelled and later allowed to move back. Excavations show that the site of Stagiros was fortified in the Heltic period (see infra ). Stagiros is recorded in the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi of 360 / 59 ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 21 ). The most famous citizen of Stagiros,Aristotle, was praised by the Delphic Amphiktyony in 334 / 3 ( Syll . ³ 275 ). Excavations were begun in 1990 . The city was situated on a promontory consisting of two hills.The earliest settlement was located on the northern hill. When the town expanded in the Classical period, building was begun on the southern hill as well, and both hills were surrounded by a wall, which is very well preserved, especially on the southern side. The wall is built in various types of masonry (Lesbian and polygonal) and has an estimated length of 1 . 5 -2 km, with both square and circular towers. It is about 2 m in width. The building of the wall was begun c. 500 (Sismanides ( 1997 ) 5 ; cf. Sismanides ( 1991 ); BCH 118 ( 1994 ) 762 ; Sismanides ( 1996 ) 279 -80 ; Camp ( 2000 ) 44 ). On the north-east part of the northern hill there is a 150 m zigzag stretch of a wall built in the late Classical period, presumably after Philip II destroyed the town (Sismanides ( 1996 ) 280 ). On the northern hill there are remains of a complex from the Byzantine period. Remains of the Archaic wall was found in this complex, along with a C6lintel with a C6 inscription, which seems to be some kind of tax regulation, imposing a tax of 5 dr. (autopsy). On the northern hill, where the oldest settlement was located, three Archaic sanctuaries have been found. One, which is situated close to the sea, may have been for Demeter. In connection with this sanctuary, many fragments of female clay protomes have been found; the other sanctuary is a circular structure, 11 m in diameter, which is probably a Thesmophorion (Sismanides ( 1997 ) 19 ). The third one is situated closer to the top of the hill. The divinity worshipped in this temple has not been identified. Theophr. Hist. Pl . 4 . 16 . 3 refers to a Mouseion in Stagiros, but it may have been located on the southern hill. Between the two hills is a depression, where the agora was situated. On the agora a C4stoa, 6 × 26 m, has been found. It is built in pseudo-isodomic masonry. Only the marble bases of the columns survive. Near the agora is a paved road, 3 m wide. A stretch of 30 m has been located so far. Furthermore, there are remains of commercial buildings, such as shops, store-rooms and a wine vat (Sismanides ( 1996 ) 286 -87 , ( 1997 ) 12 , 14 ). On top of the southern hill are the remains of the triangular acropolis. One of the sides is formed by the Classical wall, and on this side there is also a small gate. Opposite the gate is a cistern. The walls surrounding the acropolis are preserved, in some places very well, with flights of internal steps, etc. On the north-west corner there is also a watchtower. Remains of water pipes are preserved in situ , and about forty have been found so far (Sismanides ( 1996 ) 284 ). On both hills remains of dwellings have been found, dating to the Archaic, Classical and Heltic periods (Sismanides ( 1996 ) 285 -86 ). Stagiros struck silver staters on the Euboic standard from C6l. Types: obv . lion and boar; rev . incuse square, or obv . wild sow; rev . incuse square; legend: ΣΤΑΓΙ . (Gaebler ( 1930 ) 302 , ( 1935 ) 110 -11 ; SNG Cop. Macedonia 327 ; Cahn ( 1973 ))."
614,Stolos (Stolios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.2,23.4,546,2351,"614 . Stolos (Stolios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 20 , long. 23 . 40 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: α . The toponym is Στῶλος ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 23 ( 360 / 59 ); Steph. Byz. 588 . 18 ) or Σκῶλος , ηasper (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 5 ; Strabo 9 . 2 . 23 ; Eust. Il . 2 . 497 ). The city-ethnic is Στόλιος (e.g. IG i³ 259 . v . 11 ). Stolos is referred to as a polis in the urban sense in three C4 deeds of sale ( SEG 38 670 . 4 , 671 . 7 , 672 . 4 ; cf. infra ). It is called polis in the political sense at Thuc. 5 . 18 . 5 (Peace of Nikias). The city-ethnic is used externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 259 . v . 11 ). West ( 1937 a ) 166 thinks Stolos must be located in the interior of the Chalkidic peninsula, west of Akanthos (no. 559 ). Hatzopoulos ( 1988 a ) 70 -72 tentatively identifies Stolos with modern Kellion, where a number of deeds of sale have been found ( SEG 38 670 -73 (C4m)). According to Sismanides, however, there was 'an unknown, but important ancient town' at Kellion; building debris has been found there ( ArchDelt 41 ( 1986 ) Chron . 150 ). Stolos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . v . 11 ) to 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 3 ) a total of fourteen times. In the first year Stolos paid in a syntely with the Polichnitans (no. 596 ) and Mekyberna (no. 583 ). After that, it paid 4 , 000 dr. in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 17 ), 5 , 000 dr. in 448 / 7 ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 2 ) and 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 32 ), and again 4 , 000 dr. from 445 / 4 ( IG i³ 267 . ii . 26 ). In 438 / 7 and 434 / 3 Stolos paid 1 tal. ( IG i³ 274 . vi . 12 , 278 . vi . 3 ). According to the Peace of Nikias, Stolos was to be autonomos and pay the tribute as fixed by Aristeides (Thuc. 5 . 18 . 5 ). Stolos may have been a member of the Chalkidian Federation, at least in C4 . Hatzopoulos ( 1996 a ) 388 -89 argues that Stolos must have been a member of the Chalkidian Federation, since it is evident from a number of C4m deeds of sale that Stolos used the calendar also in use at Olynthos (no. 588 ). Four month names are known from C4m deeds of sale (Hatzopoulos ( 1988 a ) 65 -66 , 80 ; Trümpy, Monat . 42 -43 ). Steph. Byz. 588 . 18 -20 , without quoting any source, reports that Stolos originally was an Edonian town, which was later taken over by the Chalkidians."
615,Strepsa (Strepsaios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.3,23.1,649,3362,"615 . Strepsa (Strepsaios) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 30 , long. 23 . 10 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: α . The toponym is Στρέψα , ηasper (Aeschin. 2 . 27 ). The city-ethnic is Στρεψαῖος ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 14 ; Ar. fr. 126 , PCG ). Harp. Σ 44 , quoting Hellan. fr. 61 , classifies Strepsa as a polis in Thrace ( πόλις εστιgrave τηtildeς ΘρΩsubiotaάκης ). Hellanikos was obviously Harpokration's source for the location, but not necessarily for the siteclassification. Strepsa's status as a polis is indicated by its membership of the Delian League combined with the evidence that Strepsa was a nucleated settlement. The collective city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 14 ). The location of Strepsa has been the subject of considerable scholarly discussion (Hatzopoulos and Loukopoulou ( 1987 ) 59 ; cf. Gomme ( 1956 ) 215 -18 ; Edson ( 1955 ); Borza ( 1990 ) 294 -95 ). Hatzopoulos and Loukopoulou suggest that Strepsa be identified with modern Vasilika (cf. AR ( 1986 -87 ) 34 ; Papazoglou ( 1988 ) 202 -3 ; cf. Hammond ( 1972 ) 190 -91 ). Not far from that, at modern Ag. Paraskevi, a large C6 cemetery containing c. 500 graves has been excavated in the period 1981 -88 . All the female burials faced east, and the male west (as in nearby Thermi).Men were buried with weapons, and women with jewellery. A large amount of vessels have been recovered, both imported and local ware, and virtually all types are represented (Sismanides ( 1987 ); Macedonians ( 1994 ) 170 with photos 177 -93 ). The degree of organisation seems to show that the cemetery was part of an organised community, not just the result of private enterprise. The cemetery was remarkably rich, and it is noteworthy that weapons were found in a period when they were no longer used as grave-offerings in Attika (Kurtz and Boardman ( 1971 ) 75 ). Traces of the settlement to which the cemetery belonged were found nearby ( ArchDelt 41 ( 1986 ) Chron . 139 ). At Souroti in the vicinity two C4 graves have been found ( ArchDelt 29 ( 1973 -74 ) Chron . 697 ), and a further eight C6l-C4l graves were excavated in 1999 (Souereph and Havela ( 2001 )). The name of Strepsa's territory was Στρεψαία ( SEG 38 619 . 17 (C3e)). In 285 King Lysimachos gave to Limnaios τοgraveν [ αγροgraveν ] εν τηtildeι Στρεψαίαι (ibid.). It appears from the inscription that Limnaios was also given land in Sermyliaia and in Olynthia.Those two districts were indisputably quite close to each other, and Strepsaia seems to have been situated in the same area (Hatzopoulos ( 1988 b )). A fragmentary C4 deed of sale is from Vasilika, supposedly ancient Strepsa ( SEG 37 583 ). It is mentioned again in connection with Kallias' march from Pydna (no. 544 ) to Poteidaia (no. 598 ) in 432 (Thuc. 1 . 61 . 4 , if indeed Pluygers' emendation of επιστρέψαντες is correct), and once more in 368 when the pretender Pausanias seized Strepsa along with Anthemous (no. 562 ) and Therme (no. 552 ) (Aeschin. 2 . 27 ). Strepsa was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 14 ) to 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 68 ) a total of sixteen times, paying 1 tal. ( IG i³ 277 . vi . 9 ). It is absent from the full panel of 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 5 -27 ), which indicates that it may have participated in the Revolt of 432 ."
616,Therambos (Thrambaios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,39.55,23.4,378,1775,"616 . Therambos (Thrambaios) Map 51 . Lat. 39 . 55 , long. 23 . 40 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Θερά µ βως (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 ) or Θερα µ βηίς (Ps.-Skylax 66 ). The city-ethnic is Θρα µ βαῖος ( IG i³ 62 . 6 ) and perhaps Στρα µ βαῖος (Krateros fr. 25 (Krech 1888 )). Therambos is probably the Στρά µ βαι of Steph. Byz. 586 . 11 . Furthermore, he mentions a Θρά µ βος , ακρωτήριον Μακεδονίας ( 317 . 5 ). Ps.-Skylax 66 lists Therambos as the fourth toponym after the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense. At 7 . 123 . 1 Herodotos uses the pronoun αυaspertildeται about Therambos and seven other poleis on Pallene, and it is an almost certain inference that the noun to be supplied is πόλεις . That Therambos was a polis in the political sense too is indicated by its membership of the Delian League and, if correctly restored, by IG i³ 62 . 6 : Θρα µ βαῖοι . . . καιgrave α [ ιasper άλλαι πόλ ] εις , where the city-ethnic is attested in its collective and external sense. Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 locates Therambos on Pallene between Aige (no. 556 ) and Skione (no. 609 ). Therambos supplied Xerxes with troops and ships in 480 (Hdt. 7 . 123 . 1 ). Therambos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 10 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 8 ) a total of sixteen times, once completely restored. In the first years Therambos paid jointly with Skione; from 446 / 5 it paid alone a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 32 ). It was also assessed ( IG i³ 100 ; Krateros fr. 25 (Krech 1888 )). Apparently Therambos supported the (Athenian?) archontes present at Aphytis (no. 563 ) c. 428 ( IG i³ 62 . 6 , cf. Meritt ( 1944 ) 217 )."
617,Thestoros,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,174,904,"617 . Thestoros Not in Barr . Unlocated. Type: C:? The toponym is Θέστωρος ( IG i³ 77 . v . 36 ; Theopomp. fr. 142 ). Apart from Steph.Byz. 312 . 14 , there is no attestation of a city- ethnic. Steph. Byz. classifies Thestoros as a πόλις ΘρΩsubiotaάκης . . . Θεόπο µ πος κβ ´. We cannot know,however,whether the site-classification stems from Theopompos (Hansen ( 2000 b ) 141 -42 ). The editors of the Athenian tribute lists assume that Thestoros may have been located 'in the Olynthian territory' , since the fragment of Theopompos' Philippika in which Thestoros is mentioned deals with the C4m war between Philip and Olynthos (no. 588 ( ATL i. 490 ; cf. Shrimpton ( 1991 ) 61 ). Thestoros is recorded in the Athenian assessment decree of 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . v . 36 ), but not in any of the tribute lists. It was presumably a member of the Delian League, or at least the Athenians claimed that it was."

Hdt. 7 . 22 . 3 and Ps.-Skylax 66 (Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ) call Thyssos a polis in the urban sense, whereas Thuc. 4 . 109 . 3 -5 probably uses the word in the political sense, using polisma about the settlement.The collective city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 7 ). Thyssos was located on Athos (Hdt. 7 . 22 ; Thuc. 4 . 109 ). Thyssos was a member of the Delian League (cf. Thuc. 5 . 35 . 1 ). It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 14 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 25 ) a total of seventeen times, twice completely restored, paying 4 , 000 dr. from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 14 , restored) to 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 262 . ii . 29 ), 1½ tal. from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 23 ) and 1 tal. from 446 / 5 ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 11 ) to 429 / 8 . Thyssos was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 175 ). In 424 / 3 Thyssos joined Brasidas (Thuc. 4 . 109 . 5 ), but it must have become a member of the League again shortly after, because it was allied with Athens in 421 when it was captured by Dion (Thuc. 5 . 35 . 1 ). Thuc. 4 . 109 . 4 says that Thyssos had a mixed (i.e. barbarian-Hellenic) bilingual population, but about a century later Ps.-Skylax 66 calls it a &lt;polis&gt; Hel (FlenstedJensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 151 )."

The toponym is Τίνδη , known only from Steph. Byz. 624 . 18 . The city-ethnic is Τινδαῖος ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 29 ). In an Athenian tribute list, the Tindaioi are recorded under the heading πόλεις αaspergraveς οιasper ιδιῶται ενέγραψαν φόρον φέρειν ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 18 -21 , 29 , where polis is used in the political sense), attesting to the collective and external use of the city-ethnic. Tinde may have been a Bottiaian polis (Flensted-Jensen ( 1995 ) 123 ). Tinde was a member of the Delian League, but it is recorded in the tribute lists only once: viz . in 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 29 ), paying 3 , 000 dr. together with Kithas (no. 579 ), Gigonos (no. 572 ) and Haisa (no. 573 ). Perhaps Tinde was also listed in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iv . 83 , completely restored)."
620,Torone (Toronaios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.0,23.55,1454,7143,"620 . Torone (Toronaios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 00 , long. 23 . 55 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Τορώνη , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 122 ; Thuc. 4 . 129 . 1 ). The adjective Τορωναίην occurs in Archil. fr. 89 . 20 , West, which implies that the toponym antedates C7m. The city-ethnic is Τορωναῖος ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 28 ; IG ii² 10454 ) or ΤΕΡΩΝΑΟΝ on C5 coinage (Head, HN ² 207 ). Torone is called a polis in the urban sense (Hdt. 7 . 122 ; Thuc. 4 . 110 -14 ; Ps.-Skylax 66 ), in the territorial sense (Thuc. 4 . 110 . 2 ) and in the political sense (Thuc. 4 . 110 . 1 , 5 . 18 . 8 (Peace of Nikias); Isoc. 15 . 107 -8 ; Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 18 ); cf. politeuein used of the Toronaians in Thuc. 4 . 114 . 1 . The poet Archestratos (C4m) described Torone as an asty (fr. 24 . 1 -2 , Olson and Sens). The collective city-ethnic is used internally on coins ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 28 ). The individual city-ethnic is attested externally in a citizenship decree from Samos ( SEG 38 845 (C4l)) on a gravestone from Attika ( IG ii² 10454 (C4 )) and in Hdt. 8 . 127 . Hdt. 7 . 122 locates Torone before Gale(psos) (no. 571 ) on Sithonia. Perhaps the southernmost part of the peninsula was Toronaian territory; Steph. Byz. s.v. Αacute µ πελος calls Ampelos akra Toronaion . Thuc. 4 . 113 . 2 mentions a phrourion Lekythos on a promontory close to the city itself. About 3 km south of Torone was the Kophos limen , which belonged to Torone (Meritt ( 1923 ) 453 -54 ). The communis opinio is that T orone was a C8 colony from Chalkis (no. 365 ) (e.g. Boardman ( 1980 ) 229 , pace Harrison ( 1912 )). Nevertheless, the only ancient source to call Torone a colony from Chalkis is Diod. 12 . 68 . 6 , who evidently interpreted Thucydides' Τορώνη ηasper Χαλκιδική ( 4 . 110 . 1 ) as meaning 'Torone, a colony from Chalkis' . But the phrase does not necessarily mean that Torone was a colony from Chalkis. Thucydides may refer to Torone's membership of the Chalkidian Federation, although it is unclear whether the meaning of 'Chalkidian' is (a) geographical/territorial ( = 'situated in Chalkidike'), (b) ethnic ( = 'of the Chalkidian tribe'), or (c) specifically of Chalkis (cf. Hammond ( 1995 ) 315 n. 37 ; Hornblower ( 1997 )). In any case, Torone cannot have been a Euboian colony founded ab novo in C8 , since excavations have shown that the site of Torone was inhabited several centuries prior to C8 . Furthermore, the excavations do not support the assumption that Torone was a colony from Chalkis (see also Papadopoulos ( 1996 )). According to Hdt. 7 . 122 , T orone supplied troops and ships to Xerxes in 480 . It was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 15 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 29 ) a total of fourteen times, paying in most years 6 tal. ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 28 ), in some years 12 tal. ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 15 , 260 . viii . 10 , 281 . ii . 17 ) and in 447 / 6 possibly two payments adding up to 16 tal. ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 71 , 101 ). In 423 an oligarchic faction (Thuc. 4 . 110 . 1 -2 ) invited Brasidas to attack Torone, which was held by the Athenians,and he managed to seize it with the help of traitors inside the town (Thuc. 4 . 110 -13 ; Gehrke, Stasis 197 -98 ). The majority of the Athenians who were in Torone and those of the Toronaians who had not joined Brasidas fled to Lekythos, a fortification on a promontory a short distance from the city itself. The Athenians defended themselves, but were eventually forced to leave (Thuc. 4 . 114 -16 ). In 422 Kleon recaptured Torone (Thuc. 5 . 3 . 4 ), whereupon he exposed it to an andrapodismos by enslaving the women and the children; the men were taken captive and sent to Athens, but later ransomed by Olynthos (no. 588 ) (Thuc. 5 . 3 . 4 ; cf. Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 3 and Isoc. 12 . 63 ). Torone was a member of the Chalkidian Federation at least until 380 (Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 18 ). During the Olynthian War (i.e. in 380 ) Torone, then a member of the Chalkidian Federation, was attacked and taken by the Spartans (Xen. Hell . 5 . 3 . 18 ). In 364 Torone was taken again, this time by Timotheos (Diod. 15 . 81 . 5 ; Isoc. 15 . 108 ; Polyaen. 3 . 10 . 15 ). And finally, in 349 , before attacking Olynthos, Philip captured Torone by treachery (Diod. 15 . 81 . 5 ), but did not destroy the city. In C4l Gyges of Torone was granted citizenship in Samos ( IG xii . 6 46 ; see Hatzopoulos ( 1988 b ) 47 n. 8 ). Thuc. 4 . 113 . 2 mentions the agora of Torone. It appears from Thuc. 4 . 110 . 1 that there was a Dioskoreion c. 3 stades ( 540 m) from the city. Thuc. 4 . 116 . 2 mentions a temple of Athena in Lekythos (near the city). Fragments of a Doric temple have been interpreted as the remains of this temple (Cambitoglou and Papadopoulos ( 1988 ) 205 ; Cambitoglou ( 1990 ) 191 -92 ; Cambitoglou and Papadopoulos ( 1991 ) 159 ). Thucydides has several references to the walls of Torone (e.g. 4 . 110 -11 ). Part of the extant wall dates from the Classical period, and part of it from the Heltic period ( Ergon ( 1978 ) 27 fig. 29 ). The remains of the early Heltic fortifications are extensive (Cambitoglou and Papadopoulos ( 1988 ) 183 ). Excavations have shown that the site of Torone was inhabited continuously from the late Neolithic period to the post-Byzantine period (Papadopoulos ( 1996 ) 160 ). Torone probably had two harbours,one by the city itself,and one c. 3 km to the south, the Kophos limen (Thuc. 5 . 2 . 2 -3 ; Hornblower ( 1996 ) 425 -26 ). Thuc. 5 . 2 . 4 mentions the proasteion of Torone, and it is clear from Thuc. 4 . 114 . 2 that there were houses close to Lekythos. Beneath the Classical city an early Iron Age cemetery has been found. By 1984 , 134 graves had been excavated, yielding more than 500 vessels. The finds dated from c. 1125 to c. 850 (Cambitoglou and Papadopoulos ( 1988 ) 187 ). A house excavated in 1976 and 1978 seemed not to be of the pastas type known from Olynthos, but resembled 'the lay-out of the so-called Herdraumhäuser prevalent in north-west Greece' (Cambitoglou and Papadopoulos ( 1988 ) 186 ). Excavations on the promontory of Lekythos show that Torone was a relatively important settlement in the early Iron Age (Cambitoglou ( 1990 ) 188 ). Henry ( 1993 ) combines Thucydides'description with the archaeological evidence. Only one month name is known from Torone: viz . Artemision, found in a deed of sale (Karamanoli-Siganidou ( 1966 ); cf. SEG 24 574 . 2 (C4 )). Torone struck silver coins on the Euboic standard from C6l to c. 480 and on the Phoenician standard from c. 480 to c. 420 . Denominations: tetradrachms, tetrobols, obols and hemiobols.

Bronze coins were struck in C4 (Hardwick ( 1998 ))."
621,Tripoiai,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,182,858,"621 . Tripoiai Unlocated. Type: [A]:? The toponym is Τριποιαί ( IG i³ 76 l. 46 = Tod 68 ( c. 422 )) or Τριποαί ( IG i³ 285 . iii . 8 ). Tripoiai is listed under the heading αιasperacuteδε πόλες in a treaty of c. 422 ( IG i³ 76 . 44 , 46 ). Tripoiai was a Bottiaian polis which was located in the vicinity of Kalindoia, i.e. probably in the northern part of Bottike (Flensted-Jensen ( 1995 ) 116 -17 ). The name of the territory was Τριποαtildeτις and it was given to the Makedonians by Alexander ( SEG 36 626 . 6 -7 ( 323 )). Tripoiai was a member of the Delian League, but it is recorded only once in the tribute lists in the Thracian district: viz . in 421 / 0 ( IG i³ 285 . iii . 8 ), paying 800 dr. About the same time the Bottiaians had probably formed a confederacy (Flensted-Jensen ( 1995 ) 126 -28 ), of which Tripoiai was a member ( IG i³ 76 . 47 )."

It has been suggested (Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 186 with refs.) that the inhabitants of Zereia were the Ζηράνιοι mentioned by Theopomp. fr. 214 . Their territory is called Ζηρανία by Ephor. fr. 88 . Zereia may have been a member of the Delian League: it was assessed for tribute in 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . v . 18 ) 500 dr., but is unattested in the tribute lists. ## 4 . Unlocated Poleis"
623,Aison (Aisonios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,406,1856,"623 . Aison (Aisonios) Unlocated. Not in Barr . Type [A]:? The toponym is Αίσων ( Α [ ίσ ] ον , IG i³ 262 . iv . 27 ) or Αιasperacuteσων (h αίσον , IG i³ 271 . ii . 48 ). The city-ethnic is Αισονευacuteς ( Αισον ˜ ες , IG i³ 268 . iii . 16 ) or Αιasperσωνευacuteς (h αισον ˜ ε [ ς ], IG i³ 279 . ii . 66 ) or Αιasperσώνιος (h αισόνιοι , IG i³ 277 . v . 28 ). Aison was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 48 ) and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 19 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 54 ) a total of seventeen times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 500 dr. ( IG i³ 268 . iii . 16 ), reduced to 1 , 000 dr. in 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . ii . 62 ) or perhaps in 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 66 , amount completely restored). It is recorded twice by toponym, and otherwise by ethnic ( supra ). In the tribute list for the year 429 / 8 the Aisonioi are recorded under the heading h αίδε τ ˜ ον πόλεον αυτηgraveν τηgraveν απαρχεgraveν απέγαγον ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 51 -52 , 54 ) where polis is used in the political sense. As the Athenian tribute lists are the only sources we have for Aison, all we know about its location is that it was located somewhere in the Thracian district. A river by the name of Αίσων situated in southern Makedonia is mentioned by Plutarch at Aem . 16 . 9 . Referring to this source, RE i-ii suppl. 40 and ATL i. 467 followed by Zahrnt ( 1971 ) 146 suggest a location near the modern river Pelikas ( = ancient Aison). However, Edson ( 1947 ) 88 argues that, apart from Methone (no. 541 ), it is highly unlikely that any other Makedonian city was a member of the Delian League. He prefers to identify Aison with Haisa (no. 573 ), a suggestion rejected by Zahrnt ( 1971 ). As the evidence stands,Aison's precise location within the Thracian district remains unknown."
624,Brea ( Breaios),Thrace from Axios to Strymon,40.15,23.1,199,953,"624 . Brea ( Breaios) Map 50 . Lat. 40 . 15 , long. 23 . 10 , but see infra . Size of territory: ? Type: B: α . The toponym is Βρέα , ηasper (ML 49 . 33 ), the city-ethnic Βρεαῖος (Theopomp. fr. 145 apud Steph. Byz. 185 . 8 -9 ). An Athenian decree of c. 445 (ML 49 ), 439 / 8 (Woodhead ( 1952 ) 61 ), or perhaps 426 / 5 (Mattingly ( 1966 ) 185 ) lays down the rules for the founding of a new colony ( apoikia ), Brea, in Thrace.The name of the oecist was Demokleides. The attestation of the city-ethnic in a fragment of Theopompos (fr. 145 ) is the only evidence that the decree was carried into effect (Hansen ( 2001 ) 320 -21 ). Some scholars believe that Brea was situated in the Chalkidic peninsula (Woodhead ( 1952 ) 62 ; Asheri ( 1969 )), others that it was in Bisaltia (Meritt ( 1967 ) 48 ; Gomme ( 1945 ) 373 ). Following Pazaras and Tsanana ( 1990 ), Barr . identifies Brea or Beroia with modern Veria, which has, however, only random C4finds."

626,Okolon,Thrace from Axios to Strymon,,,90,471,"626 . Okolon Unlocated, not in Barr . Type: C:? The toponym is /acuteΟκωλον (Steph.

There is no other source, but, on the analogy of Skabala (no. 607 ), Okolon is usually taken to be an Eretrian colony situated in Thrace ( RE xii. 2 . 2385 -86 ; cf. Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 358 with n. 49 ). ## II. The Poleis"
627,Apollonia,Thrace from Strymon to Nestos,40.45,24.1,248,1273,"627 . Apollonia Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 45 , long. 24 . 10 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: α . The toponym is Απολλωνία , ηasper (Dem. 9 . 26 ; Strabo 7 fr. 35 (rC4f)). Apollonia is implicitly called a polis in the urban sense at Dem. 9 . 26 , where Olynthos, Methone and Apollonia are juxtaposed with thirty-two unnamed Thracian poleis , all destroyed by Philip; cf. also Strabo 7 fr. 33 and Pompon. 2 . 30 : urbs . Apollonia was located on the Pierian coast between Galepsos and Oisyme, on the cape enclosing the Strymonic Gulf from the east, opposite Mt. Athos (Strabo 7 fr. 33 ; Plin. HN 4 . 42 ). It was allegedly an Ionian colony (Steph. Byz. 106 . 13 , probably referring to Dem. 9 . 26 ). Together with Galepsos, it was conquered and destroyed by Philip II (Strabo 7 fr. 35 E; Dem. 9 . 26 ), presumably following the capture of Krenides in 356 (Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 363 ). This Apollonia has often been confused with Apollonia in Mygdonia (Hirschfeld ( 1895 ); cf. Papazoglou ( 1988 ) 399 -400 , see supra no. 545 ). Apollonia is tentatively identified with the sparse remains on the rocky promontory called Pyrgos Apollonias (ruins of a Byzantine fortress), c. 6 km to the east of Loutra Eleftheron (Papazoglou ( 1988 ) 400 , following Collart ( 1937 ) 88 ff)."
628,Berga (Bergaios),Thrace from Strymon to Nestos,40.55,23.3,911,4525,"628 . Berga (Bergaios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 55 , long. 23 . 30 , but see infra for a recently established different location. Size of territory: probably 3 . Type: B: β . The toponym is Βέργα , ηasper ( IG iv² . 1 94 . 19 ( 360 / 59 ); Ps.-Skymnos 653 -54 ; cf. also Ptol. 3 . 12 . 28 ) or Βέργη (Strabo 7 fr. 36 ; Steph. Byz. 163 . 13 and Hierocl. Synekd. 640 . 6 ; cf. Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 2000 ) 351 , n. 9 for an unpublished C4 inscription from Dion,where the toponym (dat. Βέργηι ) is mentioned twice) or Βέργιον (Steph. Byz. 163 . 18 ). The city-ethnic is Βεργαῖος ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 29 ; Bonias ( 2000 ) 231 ; cf. Alexis fr. 90 . 1 , PCG ). Berga is called a polis only in late sources (Ptol. 3 . 12 . 28 ; Steph. Byz. 163 . 13 ). In Strabo 7 fr. 36 it is called a kome in Bisaltia. The site-classification as a polis in the Classical period is corroborated (a) by the appearance of Berga in the tribute lists as a paying member of the Delian League ( infra ); (b) by the C5 coins; and (c) by the listing of Antiphanes Bergaios (probably the famous C4 author of Apista ) among the theorodokoi to host theoroi from Epidauros ( IG iv² . 1 94 . 19 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and in an inscription of C5f (Bonias ( 2000 ) 231 ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ). For the individual and external use, see Polyb. 34 . 6 . 15 . Recorded between Amphipolis and Tragilos in the Epidaurian theorodokoi list, Berga is located by Strabo ( 7 fr. 36 ) in the territory of the Bisaltai, c. 200 stadia (some 36 km) upstream from Amphipolis in the Strymon valley. Berga was usually sought in different locations on the west bank of the river Strymon, which was considered to be the easternmost frontier of Bisaltia (for a review of the various identifications, see Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 2000 ) 353 -58 ). It is now identified beyond reasonable doubt with the remains of an important urban centre by Neos Skopos, close to the eastern bank of the now drained Lake Achinos (ancient Kerkinitis) in the lower Strymon basin (Bonias ( 2000 ) 236 n. 28 ; Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 2000 ) 359 -61 , recording imported Ionic and Attic pottery of C6 and C5 date, C5 and C4 Attic sculpture,and various finds indicative of strong Thasian and Attic influence). On the remnants of the defence circuitnow destroyed-see Samsaris ( 1976 ) 133 . The use of the Parian-Thasian alphabet in the new C5f inscription from Neos Skopos (Bonias ( 2000 )) strongly supports the view that Berga was established as a dependent colony and, probably, emporion of Thasos providing access to commercial routes and Thracian resources through the Strymon and the Angites valleys. In 463 , following the suppression of its secession from the Delian League, Thasos must have lost control of Berga along with the rest of its mainland possessions. Consequently, the Bergaians became members of the Delian League. Berga belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 451 ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 29 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 32 ) a total of seven times. There is a gap of twelve years between 447 / 6 and 435 / 4 , and Berga is absent from the full panel of 443 / 2 ( IG i³ 269 . ii . 27 -iii . 33 ). The gap may be connected with the Athenian venture to settle 1 , 000 colonists in Bisaltia (Plut. Per . 11 . 5 ; cf. Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 117 ). Berga paid 2 , 880 dr. in 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 29 ), 3 , 240 dr. in 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 93 ) and 3 , 120 dr. from 435 / 4 on ( IG i³ 277 . vi . 30 ). In the new inscription, the obscure term βολη is unconvincingly interpreted as a reference to a council (Bonias ( 2000 ) 231 line 3 ). Berga is recorded in the Epidaurian list of theorodokoi of 359 ( IG iv² . 1 94 . i .b. 19 ). The name of the theorodokos was Antiphanes, who may be identical with the author whose patris was Berge according to Ps.-Skymnos ( 653 -54 ) (Isaac ( 1986 ) 59 ). Berga struck silver coins in, probably, C5s. Types: obv . kneeling Silenos carrying a nymph; rev . incuse square; legend: some have ΒΕΡΓ or ΒΕΡΓΑΙ on obv ., others have ΒΕΡΓΑΙΟΥ on rev . (Svoronos ( 1918 -19 ) 99 -100 ; cf. Edson ( 1947 ) 96 ; Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 117 , 121 , with an interpretation of the gen. as Βεργαίου συνοικισ µ ουtilde , implying the mixed settlement of Athenians and Bisaltians; cf. however,Peter ( 1997 ) 104 -6 : early C4 .

Size of territory: probably 3 . Type:A: β . The toponym is ∆άτος ( IG iv² . 1 94 . 32 ), ηasper (Ephor. fr. 37 ), or once οasper (Theopomp. fr. 43 ), also ∆άτον , τό (Ps.Skylax 67 ; Steph. Byz. 221 . 3 ). The city-ethnic is exclusively attested in late literary sources in the collective and external form (Harp. ∆ 7 ; Strabo 7 fr. 36 ). Datos is called a polis Hel by Ps.-Skylax 67 and in Harp. ∆ 7 quoting Ephoros, where we cannot be sure that the term polis stems from Ephoros (cf. fr. 37 ). ∆άτος / ∆άτον appears to have been the name both of the settlement itself and of the surrounding region (Ephor. fr. 37 ; Suda ∆ 92 ). Datos was proverbially rich in fertile lands, timber and gold mines (Harp ∆ 7 ; Suda ∆ 92 ). It was inhabited by Edonians (Hdt. 9 . 75 ), and situated near the Strymonian Gulf (Strabo 7 fr. 33 ; cf. fr. 36 ). The region has been identified with a more or less vast area including the left (east) bank of the lower Strymon below Mt. Pangaion, bordering on ancient Lake Prasias and extending across the Strymon-Angites confluence further eastward into the territory of the Edonians, probably into the marshlands of the plain of Philippoi (Collart ( 1937 ) 133 -37 ; cf. Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 72 , 188 ; Vatin ( 1984 ) 265 -68 ; Borza ( 1989 ) 63 -65 ). Antisara, situated on the Gulf of Kavala, west of Neapolis, served as its outlet to the sea (Steph. Byz. 100 . 17 : επίνειον ∆ατηνῶν ). Herodotos ( 9 . 75 ) locates in the region of Datos the massacre by the Edonians of the Athenian settlers under Leagros and Sophanes in 465 . Part of the Datos region probably became the territory of the homonymous urban centre,an apoikia founded c. 360 by the Thasians (Diod. 16 . 3 . 7 (r 360 / 59 ); cf. Eust. ad Dion.Perieg. 517 = GGM II 315 . 40 -44 ) under the exiled Athenian Kallistratos (Ps.-Skylax 67 ; Isoc. 8 . 24 ; Zenobios 4 . 34 , where τηgraveν αντίπεραν γηtildeν οικηtildeσαι shows that Θασίους is an obvious emendation of MS Αθηναίους ). In 360 / 59 Datos appointed a theorodokos to host the theoroi of Epidauros ( IG iv² . 1 94 . 32 ). By founding the colony at Datos, Kallistratos and the Thasians created a bridgehead aimed at controlling the whole of the Datos region, which is identified with the 'Thasian continent' of the coinage minted in 360 . Recently it was tentatively proposed to identify Datos with the fortified settlement on top of Vassilaki hill, near the village of Amygdaleonas, at the entrance of the pass leading from the plain of Philippoi over Mt. Symbolon to Neapolis (Samartzidou ( 1990 )). Shortly afterwards Datos was conquered by Philip of Makedon and renamed Philippoi (Harp ∆ 7 , quoting Ephor. fr. 37 ; Philoch. fr. 37 ). Epigraphic evidence indicates that Datos and its territory (or at least part of it) were absorbed into the territory of Philippoi: ∆άτου χώρα is mentioned in Alexander's settlement concerning the territory of Philippoi ( SEG 34 664 . 15 ; Hatzopoulos ( 1996 ) ii. no. 6 ), and the hypothesis is further corroborated by the plausible identification of Timandros, the Epidaurian theorodokos in Datos ( IG iv² . 1 94 . 32 ) with Timandros the father of five citizens of Philippoi honoured with proxenia in a Delphic decree of C4s ( Syll . ³ 267 A. 3 ; cf. Collart ( 1937 ) 177 -78 ). Thus,Datos was incorporated into Philippoi, and it is this reform that lies behind the information in several sources that Datos was renamed Philippoi. A complete equation of Datos with Krenides-Philippoi,as indicated at App. B Civ. 4 . 13 . 105 (rC4 ) and accepted by Avramea in TIR 23 -24 , is plausibly refuted by Hammond (Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 187 -88 , cf. 235 ). According to Vatin (( 1984 ) 267 -68 ), Krenides was the name of a locality populated by Thracians on the border of the region called Datos."
630,Eion,Thrace from Strymon to Nestos,40.45,23.5,906,4568,"630 . Eion Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 45 , long. 23 . 50 . Size of territory: probably 3 . Type: A: α ? The toponym is :' Ηιών , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 25 . 2 ; Thuc. 4 . 102 . 3 ; SEG 27 249 (C5e); IG i³ 265 . i . 105 ). The only attestation of a city-ethnic is at Steph. Byz. 298 . 22 . Eion is called a polis in the urban sense by Herodotos ( 7 . 113 . 1 ), who also mentions the asty and its defence circuit ( teichos , 7 . 107 . 2 ), whereas Thucydides calls it a maritime emporion of the Athenians ( 4 . 102 . 3 ). On the combined evidence of literary and numismatic sources, Hansen argues that Eion was not simply a fortified emporion (Isaac ( 1986 ) 60 -63 ; cf. Papazoglou ( 1988 ) 388 ) but indeed a (dependent) polis in the political sense (Hansen ( 2000 ) 197 -98 ), at least until the foundation of Amphipolis. Eion is said to be the maritime outlet ( limen ) of Amphipolis (schol. Thuc. 1 . 98 . 1 ). Literary sources identify Eion as ηasper επιgrave Στρυ µ όνι (Hdt. 7 . 25 . 2 ; Thuc. 1 . 98 . 1 ) and ηasper προgraveς Α µ φιπόλει (Dem. 23 . 199 ), as opposed to ' Ηιωgraveν επιgrave ΘρΩsubiotaάκης , the homonymous colony of Mende in the Chalkidike (Thuc. 4 . 7 ; see no. 570 ). Colonising ventures in the area of Eion by the Parians (no doubt involving the Parian colonists of Thasos) are inferred from a C6l epigram from Amphipolis (Lazaridis ( 1976 ); cf. BE ( 1978 ) no. 297 ; SEG 27 249 ( 525 -490 )) combined with extensive C7 -C6 archaeological remains in the area. Eion is recorded as a strongly fortified supply base of the Persian army in C5e (Hdt. 7 . 25 . 2 ), heroically defended by its governor Boges against the Athenians in 476 / 5 (Hdt. 7 . 107 ). After a protracted siege by the Athenians under Kimon,Eion was conquered and exposed to andrapodismos (Thuc. 1 . 98 . 1 ). Its capture raised unprecedented enthusiasm in Athens (Plut. Cim. 7 -8 ; cf. Perdrizet ( 1910 ) 9 -11 ), which reveals the strategic importance attached to the conquest. Eion became an emporion of the Athenians and was used as a base for their penetration and colonising efforts in the Strymon valley (Drabeskos: Thuc. 4 . 105 ; cf. schol.Aeschin. 2 . 31 ), which culminated in the foundation of Amphipolis in 437 / 6 (Thuc. 4 . 102 ). It became a strongly fortified naval base (Thuc. 4 . 107 . 2 ), and in 447 / 6 Abdera is recorded in the Athenian tribute lists paying 1 talent to Eion ( IG i³ 265 . i . 105 ). In the Peloponnesian War it controlled the entrance of the river, especially during the siege of Amphipolis in 424 and 422 (Thuc. 4 . 106 -8 , 5 . 6 ). It was probably incorporated into the territory of Amphipolis (cf. Theopomp. fr. 51 ). After the fall of Amphipolis in 424 , Brasidas' attack on Eion failed (Thuc. 4 . 107 . 1 -2 ), and Eion served as a base for Kleon's campaign in 422 (Thuc. 5 . 6 ). The Athenians in Eion were, however, forced into exile after Aigos potamoi (schol. in Aeschin. 2 . 31 ). At an unspecified date, Eion was razed to the ground by the Athenians, and its Amphipolitan inhabitants were expelled (Theopomp. fr. 51 ; cf. Jacoby ad loc . 364 , where the event is connected with the operations of Chares against Philip II in 357 ), following which Eion does not appear in any source, either historical or geographical. According to Thuc. 4 . 102 . 3 , Eion was situated on the estuary of the river Strymon, 25 s tadia ( c. 30 stadia according to Diod. 12 . 73 . 3 ) downstream from Amphipolis. It was usually sought at the mouth (most probably on the left bank) of the Strymon (Collart ( 1937 ) 73 ff). The acropolis of Eion was recently identified on the Prophitis Elias hill, with surface finds dating from C7 to C5f (Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1980 a ) 423 ) and C6 cemetery strata (KoukouliChryssanthaki and Samartzidou ( 1984 ) 276 ; cf. Pritchett ( 1965 ) 40 and Papazoglou ( 1988 ) 389 . For remains of the precolonial period, see Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1993 ) 684 -85 ). A fragmentary boundary stone of 'Classical date' from the ruins of the Byzantine castle of Marmarion is tentatively restored as indicating the presence of a sanctuary of Artemis in the area (Papangélos ( 1990 ); cf. BE ( 1991 ) no. 414 ). A number of C5f silver and electrum coins discovered in the area have been attributed to Eion. ( 1 ) Electrum: denominations: hekte and fractions. Type: obv . goose with or without lizard; rev . incuse square. ( 2 ) Silver: denominations: drachm and fractions down to hemiobol. Type: obv . one or two geese usually with lizard,often letters in field; rev . incuse square (Head, HN ² 197 ; SNG Cop. Macedonia 173 -81 )."
631,Galepsos (Galepsios),Thrace from Strymon to Nestos,40.45,24.0,839,4235,"631 . Galepsos (Galepsios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 45 , long. 24 . 00 (to be distinguished from Galepsos in Sithonia (no. 571 ); size of territory: probably 3 . Type: [A]: α . The toponym is Γαληψός , ηasper (Thuc. 4 . 107 . 3 ; schol.Thuc. 5 . 6 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 67 ), said to derive from Galepsos, son of Thasos and Telephe (Marsyas the Younger ( FGrH 136 ) fr. 5 ). The city-ethnic is Γαλήψιος ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 15 ). In Ps.-Skylax 67 Galepsos is the third of four toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense. For polis used in the political sense, see Diod. 12 . 68 . 4 (rC5s). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ). For the individual and external use, see an undated Athenian funerary inscription ( SEG 32 297 ; cf. no. 571 ). Galepsos was a colony ( apoikia ) of Thasos (Thuc. 4 . 107 . 3 , 5 . 6 . 1 ; Heraclid. Pont. fr. 125 , Wehrli; Diod. 12 . 68 . 4 ). Qualified as a πόλις ' Ελληνιgraveς and one of the emporia of the Thasians by Ps.-Skylax 67 , it is generally considered as one of the mainland emporia of Thasos (Avram ( 1995 ) 193 : 'Ursprünglich bloss einem Emporion der Thasier') or rather a dependent polis and an emporion in the mainland peraia of Thasos (Hansen ( 1997 ) 88 , ( 2000 ) 199 ). Galepsos was a member of the Delian League.It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 15 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . iii . 21 , heavily restored) a total of fourteen times,paying first c. 1½ tal. ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 15 ) reduced to 3 , 000 dr. in 443 / 2 ( IG i³ 269 . iii . 3 ) and further reduced to 1 , 000 dr. in 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 35 ). After the fall of Amphipolis in 424 , Galepsos was won over by Brasidas with the assistance of the Makedonian king Perdikkas (Thuc. 4 . 107 . 3 ), but was recaptured by Kleon two years later (Thuc. 5 . 6 . 1 ). It was conquered and destroyed by Philip II (Strabo 7 fr. 35 ), presumably soon before or after his capture of Krenides in 356 (Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 363 ); however, it was probably refounded by the Makedonians, as inferred by the mention of Galepsos in Livy ( 44 . 45 . 14 -15 (rC2f)), drawing on Polybios. Galepsos is generally identified with the ruins at Gaïdourokastro, a C5e fortified citadel, strategically located south of the village of Karyani ( 7 -8 km south-west of Orfano),which dominates both the Strymonic Gulf and the Pierian coast (Collart ( 1937 ) 78 -80 , following Perdrizet ( 1894 ) 440 ; detailed description of the site in Bakalakis and Mylonas ( 1938 ); plan of the citadel in Lazaridis ( 1971 ) fig. 64 ). The earliest finds are dated to C7l and C6e (Romiopoulou ( 1960 )), indicating its foundation as a Thasian colony as early as C7l, possibly on the site of a preexisting Thracian settlement. A C6 -C4 cemetery, including both inhumation and cremation burials,was excavated on a low hill, south-west of the citadel, some 200 m from the coast (Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1972 c ) 526 -27 ). The existence of a sanctuary of Zeus, worshipped with the epithets herkeios, patroios and ktesios , is assumed from the discovery of two C5l-C4e boundary stones with characteristic Parian/Thasian lettering (Collart ( 1937 ) 79 , n. 4 , with refs.). Moreover, the urban centre at Gaïdourokastron may be related to the neighbouring coastal settlement identified 1 km to the east,on the Pithari hill,which is probably linked to the C6 tombs excavated in the vicinity, and with an unlocated sanctuary of Demeter with a hekatompedos temple, mentioned on four inscribed boundary stones found at the foot of the hill (unpublished; cf. Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1982 ) 325 -26 ; BE ( 1994 ) no. 433 ). Galepsos struck bronze coins, probably in C4e, but so far only three pieces are known (Bon and Bon ( 1936 ); BCH ( 1930 ); cf. Robert ( 1940 ) 90 , n. 1 ). Obv . head of Dionysos; rev . protome of ram; legend: ΓΑΛΗΨΙΩΝ (Bon ( 1936 ) 172 -74 ; Robert ( 1940 ) 90 n. 1 ; Liampi ( 1991 ) 30 with n. 63 ). These coins are sometimes erroneously attributed to Galepsos on Sithonia (Blanchet, RN ( 1937 ) 325 ; Demetriadi ( 1974 )."
632,Krenides (Krenites),Thrace from Strymon to Nestos,41.0,24.15,391,1840,"632 . Krenides (Krenites) Map 51 . Lat. 41 . 00 , long. 24 . 15 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: α . The toponym is Κρηνίδες , αιasper ( IG i² 127 . 45 ; Tod 157 , 356 ; Diod. 16 . 3 . 7 ). The city-ethnic is ## 862 loukopoulou Κρηνίτης (Artem. fr. 15 , GGM i 476 ). Krenides is called a polis in late sources only (Diod. 16 . 8 . 6 (r 361 )), but polis status in C4 is strongly indicated by its mint ( infra ). The legend on the coins shows that the polis was a Thasian dependency ( infra ). In C1 it had dwindled to a κατοικία µ ικρά (Strabo 7 fr. 41 ). Krenides is said to have drawn its name from springs rising near the foot of its acropolis (App. B Civ. 4 . 105 ; Strabo 7 fr. 34 ; cf. Collart ( 1937 ) 39 ff). It was colonised by the Thasians c. 360 / 59 (Diod. 16 . 3 . 7 ). That the exiled Athenian Kallistratos was involved in the colonisation is argued by some historians (Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 187 -88 , 235 ; Vatin ( 1984 ) 267 -68 ), but has no foundation in the sources (see supra ). Krenides was located near Mt.Pangaion,possessing numerous gold mines, where the city of Philippoi was eventually established (Strab. 7 fr. 34 ; Artem. fr. 15 ; Diod. 16 . 3 . 7 ). Threatened by Thracian attacks,it requested aid from Philip II, who occupied and fortified it ( 356 ), introducing new Makedonian settlers and renaming it Philippoi (Artem. fr. 15 ; Diod. 16 . 3 . 7 , 8 . 6 ; Steph. Byz. 383 . 9 -10 ; App. B Civ . 4 . 105 ); see infra 865 . Krenides struck coins of gold and bronze c. 360 -356 . Type: obv . head of Herakles; rev . tripod (gold), or club and bow (bronze); legend: ΘΑΣΙΟΝ ΗΠΕΙΡΟ . The types are identical with those of Philippoi, which shows that they were struck by the precursor of Philippoi, i.e. Krenides (Head, HN ² 217 ; Le Rider ( 1956 ) 16 -19 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) no. 509 ; SNG Cop. Macedonia 219 )."
633,Myrkinos (Myrkinios),Thrace from Strymon to Nestos,40.55,23.5,475,2267,"633 . Myrkinos (Myrkinios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 55 , long. 23 . 50 , according to Barr ., but precise location unknown ( infra ). Size of territory: probably 3 . Type:A: β . The toponym is Μυacuteρκινος , ηasper (Hdt. 5 . 11 . 2 ; Thuc. 4 . 107 . 3 ), but Μυρκιννία according to Parthenios fr. 659 . 1 , apud Steph. Byz. 463 . 15 . The city-ethnic is Μυρκίνιος , attested at Thuc. 5 . 10 . 9 in the collective and external sense. Myrkinos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 5 . 11 . 2 ) and in the political sense (Thuc. 4 . 107 . 3 ), but only a polichnion by Diodoros ( 12 . 68 . 4 (r 424 )). The toponym designates both the settlement and its hinterland (Hdt. 5 . 23 . 1 ; Steph. Byz. 463 . 14 ). Myrkinos was an Edonian community (Thuc. 4 . 107 . 3 ; Hdt. 5 . 126 . 2 ), with a mixed population of Greeks and barbarians (Hdt. 5 . 23 . 2 ). It was colonised and fortified (Hdt. 5 . 23 . 1 , 124 . 2 ) c. 509 (Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 68 n. 4 ) by Histiaios, the tyrant of Miletos, who received it as a gift from Dareios (Hdt. 5 . 11 , 124 . 2 ). In 497 the city received a new contingent of Greek colonists when Aristagoras fled Miletos with a group of Milesians and settled in Myrkinos (Hdt. 5 . 124 . 2 , 126 ). Shortly afterwards he and his army were massacred by the Edonians (Hdt. 5 . 126 ). In C5s Myrkinos was ruled by the king of the Edonians, Pittakos; after he was murdered, Myrkinos fell to the sons of Goaxis and his wife Brauro, and following the fall of Amphipolis in 424 , the Myrkinians joined Brasidas and provided a sizeable contingent of cavalry and peltasts ( 1 , 000 together with the Chalkidians) and cavalry for his campaign against Kleon, who was actually killed by a Myrkinian peltast (Thuc. 5 . 6 . 4 and 5 . 10 . 9 ). Myrkinos was situated in an area rich in gold, silver and timber (Hdt. 5 . 23 ) at the western end of the plain of Philippoi, near Drabeskos and the river Strymon (App. B Civ . 4 . 105 ; Strabo 7 fr. 33 ); but the precise location remains unidentified (Samsaris ( 1976 ) 141 : = modern Myrkinos (formerly Doxambos); more probably = ancient site near Palaiokomi (formerly Provista), to the north-west of Mt. Pangaion (Papazoglou ( 1988 ) 390 -91 ; cf. Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 68 ; TIR 42 -43 s.v.)."
634,Neapolis (Neopolites),Thrace from Strymon to Nestos,40.55,24.25,1603,8389,"634 . Neapolis (Neopolites) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 55 , long. 24 . 25 . Size of territory: probably 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Νεάπολις ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 13 -14 ; Ps.-Skylax 67 ; IG iv² . 1 94 . 27 ( 360 / 59 )) or Νέα Πόλις ( IG i³ 101 . 44 ; Ps.-Skymnos 659 ), often accompanied by geographical specifications: εν ΘρΩsubiotaάκηsubiotaη ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 9 -10 ) or παραgrave Αντισάραν ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 13 ) to distinguish it from homonymous cities. The city-ethnic is Νεοπολίτης ( IG i³ 101 . 2 ) or Νεαπολίτης ( F.Delphes iii . 4 414 . 13 (C3f)) and is often geographically specified: Νεοπολῖται παρ ' Αντισάραν ( IG i³ 278 . v . 14 -15 ) or Νεοπολῖται οιasper αποgrave ΘρΩsubiotaάκης ( IG i³ 101 . 32 and 48 ). The second part of the compound toponym testifies to the polis status of Neapolis. In Ps.-Skylax 67 Neapolis is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense; and in the so-called Charter of the Second Athenian Naval League Neapolis appears under the heading πόλεις αιasperacuteδε συacute µµ αχοι ( IG ii² 43 . 78 and B. 34 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian decrees and tribute lists ( supra ). The individual and external use is attested in a Thasian inscription of C5l ( IG xii . 8 263 . 12 -13 ). Neapolis was situated at the northernmost limit of the Strymonic Gulf, near the coast of the Datenoi (Strabo 7 frr. 32 and 36 ) not far from Daton itself (Ps.-Skylax 67 ). It is the last city attested by Ps.-Skylax 67 west of the river Nestos; in the list of the Epidaurian theorodokoi it is recorded before Abdera and after Mende ( IG iv² . 1 94 . 27 ), in the Delphic list of theorodokoi after Philippoi and Oisyme but before [ Σ ] άπαι ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 82 ). According to Cassius Dio ( 47 . 35 . 3 ) it was located on the coast opposite Thasos, separated from the plain of Philippoi by Mt. Symbolon. The port of Neapolis is mentioned in an Athenian decree of 409 ( IG i³ 101 . 28 ; Lazaridis ( 1969 ) 20 and 23 ). The proposed identification with Kavala (Heuzey and Daumet ( 1876 ) 18 -20 ; cf. Collart ( 1937 ) 105 -6 ) was archaeologically confirmed by the discovery of segments of polygonal fortification walls of a Classical citadel on the Pharos peninsula (plan in Lazaridis ( 1971 ) fig. 69 ). The disputed origin of Neapolis from either Thasos or Athens or Eretria (Collart ( 1937 ) 112 -24 ) was settled by Pouilloux (( 1954 ) 158 ff), who emphasised the decisive argument provided by the archaeological material: Thasian-Parian lettering in C6 graffiti and standard Thasian types of early Neapolis coinage (Kraay ( 1976 ) 150 -51 ). It is notable that in 411 -409 , at the request of the Neopolitans, Athens erased the express reference to Neapolis being a colony of Thasos from the first of two honorific decrees ( IG i³ 101 . 7 , 8 ( rasurae ), cf. 68 -69 ). Neapolis was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and was entered on the Athenian tribute lists first by toponym ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 9 -10 ) but from 443 / 2 by city-ethnic ( IG i³ 269 . ii . 28 ). It is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 9 -10 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 19 -20 ) a total of fourteen times, once completely restored, and paid in all years 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 265 . i . 20 ). A further proof of its continued independence of Thasian control is inferred from the fact that it had control over customs dues collected in its own harbour ( IG i³ 101 . 27 -30 ; Isaac ( 1986 ) 67 ). Thus the fact that some Neopolitans possessed property in Thasos, which was confiscated by the oligarchic government of that island in 411 ( IG xii . 8 263 . 5 -7 , 12 -13 ), reflects most probably the survival of a situation dating from before 463 , when Neapolis, with the rest of the Thasian peraia , was detached from the territory of Thasos. Following the defection of Thasos from the Athenian League in 411 , Neapolis remained loyal to Athens, causing Neopolitan oligarchs to take refuge in Thasos, while the property of Neopolitan democrats in Thasos was confiscated ( IG xii . 8 263 ; cf. the admission into the citizen body of Thasos of presumed Neopolitan refugees born of Thasian mothers ( IG xii . 8 264 ( c. 408 -404 ); cf. Wilhelm ( 1911 -32 ) ii ( 1914 ) no. 14 ; Collart ( 1937 ) 129 -30 ). Unsuccessfully besieged by the Thasians, the Neopolitans were praised by the Athenians for their loyalty and for participating in the siege of Thasos by Thrasyboulos ( IG i³ 101 ( 410 / 9 )). A problematic inscription from Paros ( IG xii . 5 109 (C5l-C4e)), usually considered as a treaty between Thasian oligarchs and Paros with the participation of Neopolitan refugees ( οιasper Νεοπολῖται οιasper εν ΘάσΩsubiotaω ), has been interpreted as a peace treaty between Thasians and Neopolitans organised by Paros (Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 178 -92 ; cf. IG xii . 8 264 , from Thasos and the fragmentary treaty of reconciliation between Thasos and Neapolis in 390 recently discovered in Delphi: Moretti ( 1987 ) with refs.). Having preserved its independence from Thasos in the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War, Neapolis became a member of the Second Athenian Naval League in 375 / 4 ( IG ii² 43 B. 34 ). This independent status seems to have been preserved even after the expansion of the peraia of Thasos in the plain of Daton in 360 / 59 , obliging Thasos to seek an alternative outlet to the sea for the produce of her new possessions: it may account for the record of Antisara as a port of the Datenoi in Steph. Byz. ( 100 . 17 ). In the spring of 355 Neapolis sent ambassadors to Athens to negotiate the conclusion of an alliance with Athens, presumably against Philip II of Makedon ( IG ii² 128 ). The termination of the Neopolitan coinage around the same period indicates the final annexation of Neapolis to the Makedonian kingdom. C3epigraphic testimony from Delphi ( F.Delphes iii . 4414 . 13 ) and the fact that Neapolis hosted theoroi of Delphi in C3l ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 82 ) indicate that its civic status remained unchanged after the foundation of Philippoi; cf. Papazoglou ( 1988 ) 403 . The poliad deity of Neapolis was Athena Parthenos, as confirmed by epigraphic and figurative testimonies (Bakalakis ( 1936 a ) 33 nos. 1 and 2 ). The relief crowning a C4m Athenian decree in favour of the Neopolitans represents Athena and a polos -wearing goddess, identified by the legend ΠΑΡΘΕΝΟΣ ( IG ii² 128 ; Lawton ( 1995 ) no. 28 ), and Parthenos is presumed to be represented in the relief crowning the C5l decree as well ( IG i³ 101 ; Lawton ( 1995 ) no. 7 ). Her sanctuary, attested in IG i³ 101 . 45 , 57 and 63 (cf. T od 84 ), was identified on decisive epigraphic evidence with the archaeological remains of a monumental C6 temple (Ionic capitals and fragments of entablature) discovered inside the citadel,on the Pharos peninsula in Kavala,presumed to have replaced an earlier wooden construction. The earliest pottery finds in the sanctuary were dated to c. 650 -625 (Lazaridis ( 1961 -62 ) 235 -6 ), while a rich Archaic deposit yielded Thasian, Corinthian and East Greek ware ( 625 -600 ) and C6m Attic black-figure (Lazaridis ( 1961 -62 ); for probable pre-colonial pottery, cf. Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1993 ) 686 -87 ). Moreover,a cult of Artemis with the epithet Opitais is epigraphically attested (Lazaridis ( 1941 -42 )). Some further information concerning religious institutions in Neapolis is preserved in a C4 (?) inscription mentioning a neokoros of the Parthenos and the existence of a kreophylakion ( = archives; Collart ( 1937 ) 108 -9 ). Neapolis struck silver coins from c. 530 to the Makedonian conquest in C4m, and bronze in C4s. ( 1 ) Silver on the Babylonian standard, c. 530 -C5l: denominations: stater,third, ninth.Type: obv .

635,Oisyme (Oisymaios),Thrace from Strymon to Nestos,40.5,24.2,977,5317,"635 . Oisyme (Oisymaios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 50 , long. 24 . 20 . Size of territory: probably 3 . Type. A: α . The toponym is Οισυacute µ η , ηasper (Thuc. 4 . 107 . 3 ; Ant. fr. 25 , Sauppe), Οισυacute µ α in the Delphic list of theorodokoi ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 81 ), identified in Steph. Byz. 487 . 8 with Homeric Αισυacute µ η (Hom. Il . 8 . 304 ). Oisyme is said to have been renamed ' Η µ αθία after Makedonian Emathia (Ps.-Skymnos 456 -58 ; Steph. Byz. 487 . 8 ), presumably following its occupation by Philip II. The city-ethnic is Οισυ µ αῖος (C4stamped amphora handles (Bakalakis ( 1938 ) 101 -2 ; cf. Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1969 )). Both the toponym and the ethnic are epigraphically attested in C3 ( SGDI 2600 ; BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 81 ; cf. Robert ( 1940 ) 89 n. 4 ). Oisyme is called a polis by Harpokration ( Ο 12 ), quoting Ephoros (fr. 36 ): πόλις εστιgrave τηtildeς ΘρΩsubiotaάκης , καθά φασιν άλλοι τε καιgrave /acuteΕφορος εν δ ' . Here Ephoros is probably quoted for the site-classification, since Harp. quotes Antiphon for the toponym. Polis is probably used in the urban sense (see Ant. fr. 23 , Sauppe). In Ps.-Skylax 67 , Oisyme is the last of four toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense; cf. Ps.-Skymnos 656 -57 . For polis used in the political sense, see Diod. 12 . 68 . 4 (rC5s). The collective use of the cityethnic is attested internally on stamped handles ( supra ) and on coins ( infra ). The individual and external use is attested in a C3m Delphic proxeny decree ( SGDI II 2600 ). Oisyme was a colony ( apoikia ) of Thasos (Thuc. 4 . 107 . 3 ; Diod. 12 . 68 . 4 (r 424 )). Qualified as a πόλις ' Ελληνίς and one of the emporia of the Thasians by Ps.-Skylax 67 , it is classified as both a dependent polis and an emporion in the mainland peraia of Thasos (Hansen ( 1997 ) 88 , ( 2000 ) 199 ). Situated in Thrace (Ephor. fr. 36 ), Oisyme is indeed the only city of the Thasian peraia mentioned in Homer ( Il . 8 . 304 ). Listed in the C3l Delphic list of theorodokoi between Philippoi and Neapolis ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) III 81 ), it is located by Armenidas ( apud Athen. 1 . 31 a), together with Antisara, in the βιβλία χώρα renowned for the excellent quality of its wine, and by Ptolemy on the coast of Edonis (Ptol. 3 . 12 . 7 ). Oisyme joined Brasidas after his capture of Amphipolis in 424 , following the example of Myrkinos and Galepsos (Thuc. 4 . 107 . 3 ). Thereafter and during C4 her fortune seems to have followed that of the neighbouring communities: Phagres, Galepsos and Apollonia. Oisyme was securely-yet without definitive proofidentified by Bakalakis (( 1938 ) 97 -102 , following Heuzey and Daumet ( 1876 ) and Collart ( 1937 ) 81 -87 ) with the fortified citadel on Cape Vrasidas, south of the village of Nea Peramos, in the southern part of the bay of Eleutherai (Leftero Limani). Excavations undertaken in 1938 and again in 1964 , 1968 and 1987 -90 are summarised in Giouri and Koukouli ( 1987 ); cf. Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1980 b ) 317 -18 ; Koukouli-Chryssanthaki and Papanikolaou ( 1990 ). The acropolis wall was built over a pre-colonial stratum on the hill-top (plans in Lazaridis ( 1971 ) figs. 66 -67 ; Giouri and Koukouli ( 1987 ) 366 ) and shows two distinct phases (irregular polygonal and rectangular ashlar local granite masonry, respectively); in C5f, a second wall extended the walled area to the north. The settled area spread to the south-east flank of the hill, towards the natural harbour. The cemetery of Oisyme, excavated in the sea-coast sanddunes south of the citadel,testifies to the existence of the settlement from 650 to 625 and indicates close cultural relations with Thasos and its mainland colonies (Giouri and Koukouli ( 1987 ) 365 , with refs.). Remains of a monumental rectangular C5e temple excavated at the top of the acropolis hill (plans in Giouri and Koukouli ( 1987 ) plans 2 -3 ; Koukouli-Chryssanthaki and Papanikolaou ( 1990 ) 488 ) were found to succeed an older temple which was destroyed in C5e. A pre-colonial stratum was identified under the Archaic temple (Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1987 ), ( 1988 )). Finds in the destruction layer and in a nearby deposit include roof tiles, decorated terracotta antefixes, C7s-C5e pottery, various types of terracotta female figurines, and fragments of large-size C6l clay kore-type statues, mostly relating to materials from Thasos. Imported ware include C7 and C6 Corinthian, Attic, Cycladic and East Greek productions. The excavators attributed the sanctuary-mainly on the basis of the figurine types and of bronze shield dedications-to Athena Polias, referring to the sanctuary of the same goddess on the acropolis of Thasos, which also suffered destruction in C5e and was similarly reconstructed on a larger scale. The construction of the C5 temple in Oisyme is considered to be contemporary with the restoration and extension of the defence walls, as in the case of Thasos. Its destruction layer abounds in C2 pottery (C4 -C2 are represented only sparsely in surface finds). Rare C4 bronze coins of Oisyme have been related to a short period of civic autonomy (Picard ( 1993 ); cf. ( 1994 ) 467 ). Type: obv . head of helmeted Athena; rev . kneeling archer Herakles; legend: ΟΙΣΥΜΑΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 892 )."
636,Phagres (Phagresios),Thrace from Strymon to Nestos,40.45,23.55,564,2952,"636 . Phagres (Phagresios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 45 , long. 23 . 55 . Size of territory: probably 3 . Type: [A]: α . The toponym is Φάγρης , -ητος (Hecat. fr. 156 ; Hdt. 7 . 112 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 67 ). The city-ethnic is Φαγρήσιος ( SEG 38 656 (C4 )). In Ps.Skylax 67 , Phagres is the second of four toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense. In Hdt. 7 . 112 . 2 it is described, together with Pergamon, as a teichos of the Pieres (Hdt. 7 . 112 ), whereas Thuc. 2 . 99 . 3 calls Phagres a chorion . That Phagres was a polis in the political sense is indicated by its mint ( infra ) and by the recording of its city-ethnic in a Delphic catalogue of communities which seem to have been either poleis or islands with more than one polis ( F.Delphes iii . 1 497 . 4 (C4l-C3e)). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ) and externally in the Delphic catalogue ( supra ). The individual and external use is attested on a C4funerary stele from Eleutheropolis ( SEG 38 656 ). Phagres was one of the πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες in Thrace,listed between Amphipolis and Galepsos by Ps.-Skylax 67 and further described as a Thasian emporion . From the time of Philip II and Alexander III it was part of Makedonia (Strabo 7 fr. 33 ). Phagres is said to have been settled by Pieres expelled from the Makedonian Pieria under Perdikkas I east of the mouth of the river Strymon, at the westernmost end of the Pierian coast (Thuc. 2 . 99 . 3 ). It must have been strongly fortified, as indicated by its classification as a teichos in Hdt. 7 . 112 . 2 . At an unknown date in C6 (?), Phagres was presumably colonised by the Thasians and incorporated in their mainland peraia . Together with Galepsos and Apollonia,Phagres may have been one of the poleis occupied and destroyed by Philip II after his capture of Amphipolis (Strabo 7 fr. 35 ; cf. Dem. 9 . 26 ). The urban centre was tentatively located on a hill (Kanoni) rich in ancient remains east of the village of Orphanion, c. 8 km to the east of the mouth of the Strymon (Leake ( 1835 ) iii. 176 ff), followed by Perdrizet ( 1894 ) 440 and Collart ( 1937 ) 76 ff; cf. BE ( 1990 ) no. 491 ). Recent excavations on the site revealed abundant C6s-C5e good-quality Attic and Thasian pottery, which was collected from a group of circular pits and was interpreted as remains from a destruction suffered by the city in C5f (Nikolaidou-Patera ( 1989 ) 490 ). Archaeological remains, including a Heltic building and a cemetery of Heltic date (C3l-C2e) located to the north-west of the hill, indicate the survival of the settlement probably down to the Roman period (NikolaidouPatera ( 1987 ), ( 1989 ) 489 -91 , ( 1990 ) 517 -21 , ( 1996 )). The site identification was confirmed by the discovery of one bronze coin of C4f. Type: obv . laureate head of Apollo; rev . lion protome; legend: ΦΑΓΡ (Liampi ( 1991 ))."
637,Philippoi (Philippeus),Thrace from Strymon to Nestos,41.0,24.15,1206,6428,"637 . Philippoi (Philippeus) Map 51 . Lat. 41 . 00 , long. 24 . 15 . Size of territory: probably 2 or 3 . Type: B: α . The toponym is Φίλιπποι , οιasper (Arist. Mir. ausc . 833 a 28 ; Artem. fr. 15 , GGM i 576 . 7 (rC4m); BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 80 (C3l)). The city-ethnic is Φιλιππευacuteς ( IG iv 617 . 21 (C4l)) or (once in Polybios) Φιλιππηνός (fr. 85 ), or (internally and in plural) Φίλιπποι (coins, infra ; Hatzopoulos ( 1996 ) ii. no. 36 . 13 , Kos: τηgrave µ πόλιν τηgraveν Φιλίππων , 243 ; cf. Hatzopoulos ( 1993 ) 322 with n. 22 ). Philippoi is not called a polis in any Classical source, but its status as a polis is strongly indicated by its C4m coinage combined with numerous attestations of polis status in the Heltic period (Rigsby ( 1996 ) no. 27 . 7 , 9 , 13 , 15 ( 243 / 2 ); Hatzopoulos ( 1996 ) ii. no. 37 . 2 (C2 ); Artem. fr. 15 , GGM i 576 . 7 ; cf. Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 358 -61 ). The collective form of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and in inscriptions ( IG iv 617 . 21 (C4l); IG ii² 1956 . 149 (C4l)). For the individual and external form, see IG vii 2433 , Thebes (C3 -C2 ). Founded and fortified by Philip II (Artem.fr. 15 ), who intervened to protect Krenides in 356 when it was threatened by the Thracians of Kersebleptes in 356 , Philippoi is recorded as having replaced Krenides (Strabo 7 frr. 41 and 43 ; Diod. 16 . 3 . 7 , 8 . 6 ; Artem. fr. 15 (all rC4f)) or Daton (Ephor. fr. 37 ; Philoch. fr. 44 ; cf. App. B Civ . 4 . 13 . 105 : Krenides = Daton = Philippoi). The identification of Timandros (the theorodokos of the Epidaurian theoroi at Daton in 360 / 59 ( IG iv² . 1 94 . 32 )) with the father of five Philippeis appointed proxenoi of Delphi in a C4l decree ( Syll . ³ 267 A; cf. Collart ( 1937 ) 177 -78 ) confirms the permanence of the pre-Makedonian population (of Thasian origin) in Philip's new foundation. Philippoi is listed between Amphipolis and Oisyme in the catalogue of Delphic theorodokoi ( BCH 21 ( 1945 ) iii . 80 ). It is located near Mt. Pangaion, rich in gold and silver mines, on the site of Krenides (Strabo 7 fr. 34 ; cf. fr. 41 ); it is also said to lie near Mt.Symbolon,which extends between Neapolis and Philippoi,i.e.in the plain between the mountains (Dio Cass. 47 . 35 . 4 ). According to App. B Civ . 4 . 105 , the city of Philippoi covered-at least in Roman times-the entire width of a steep hill. The original boundaries of Philippoi remain unknown. A boundary settlement concerning Philippoi dictated by Alexander III (recently, Hatzopoulos ( 1996 ) ii. no. 6 = Ager ( 1996 ) no. 5 ) and dated to 335 or 330 attests not only to ambassadors of Philippoi submitting requests to the Makedonian king (ii. 11 , as restored in Ager), but also to the king's intervention in matters of boundary disputes: viz . exploitation and allocation of uncultivated lands and dues thereon ( i . 4 -6 ); delimitation and re-establishment of the integrity of the territory ( i . 8 ) initially donated to the city by its founder Philip II ( i . 8 -13 ), which had apparently been trespassed upon ( 8 and 12 ), presumably by the Thracians; a special provision (exclusion ?) concerning part (more than 2 , 000 plethra ) of the territory of Daton ( i . 13 -15 ); the measurement and addition of new territory ( ii . 1 -2 ); the confirmation of territorial rights of Philippoi as opposed to those of the Thracians ( ii . 2 -5 ), followed by a summary topographic delimitation,presumably of the new borders of the territory of Philippoi mentioning hills ( ii . 7 ), attributing to Philippoi the land around the territory of Sirra ( ii . 8 ) and including Daineros , as established by Philip II ( ii . 8 -10 ), allocating the marshes to Philippoi as far as 'the bridge' ( ii . 12 -13 ), and provisionally forbidding sales of forest land on Mt. Dysoron ( ii . 10 ). The document indicates that the boundaries of Philippoi following Alexander's arbitration (and confirming Philip's initial settlement-as indeed in the Roman period (Papazoglou ( 1982 ) 99 -102 )-included only part of the territory to the west and north-west (possibly east of Mt. Menoikion), allowing the Thracians of the Strymon valley to remain in possession of at least part of their lands. Attested sales transactions from Philippoi include the sale of sacred lands in C4s ( temene ), and a unique testimony regarding civic taxation is inferred from the mention of a c. 2 per cent επώνιον imposed on land transactions. The documents also record several deities worshipped in C4s Philippoi, one each for Ares, Poseidon and the Heroes, two for Philip-presumably Philip II, being the object of heroic cult as the ktistes of the city (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 ) ii. no. 83 ; cf. Ducrey ( 1988 ), ( 1990 )). The constitution of pre-Roman Philippoi presents all the characteristics of a Heltic polis . It is inferred from, especially, the decree of asylia for Kos (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 ) ii. no. 36 , Kos ( 243 ) = Rigsby ( 1996 ) no. 27 ), that the original constitution remained unchanged during C4 and most of C3 . The documents confirm the particular political status of Philippoi, formally founded as a-theoretically-independent polis , an ally of the Makedonians, yet institutionally organised on the Platonic model current at that time (Hatzopoulos ( 1996 ) i. 158 -60 , 186 -88 ). Furthermore, evidence from unpublished hierokerykeia sales deeds supports the view that the calendar used in pre-Roman Philippoi was not the Makedonian, but 'an original calendar with names of months formed on the names of the Twelve Gods, just as in Cassadreia' , another Makedonian foundation with closely related institutions of Platonic inspiration according to Hatzopoulos (Hatzopoulos ( 1993 ) 322 -23 ; cf. ( 1996 ) i. 158 -60 ). Philippoi, as the oldest Makedonian foundation, must have served as a model for subsequent foundations. The political status and institutions of the pre-Roman city were recently reconstructed from Heltic epigraphic material (Hatzopoulos ( 1993 ); cf. Hatzopoulos ( 1996 ) i. passim ). Philippoi struck coins of gold, silver and bronze c. 356 -330 . Denominations: gold stater; silver tetradrachm, drachm, hemidrachm; and fractions in bronze.

Size of territory: probably 3 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Πίστυρος (Hdt. 7 . 109 . 2 ). Pistyros is not mentioned in any other source, unless it is identified with Βίστιρος , πόλις ΘρΩsubiotaάκης ωasperς Πίστιρος τοgrave ε µ πόριον (Steph. Byz. 171 . 6 ). Thus, the polis Bistiros is explicitly distinguished from the emporion Pistiros, mentioned again at Steph. Byz. 524 . 11 : Πίστιρος , ε µ πόριον ΘρΩsubiotaάκης , undoubtedly to be identified with the toponym Πίστιρος and the collective ethnic Πιστιρηνοί epigraphically attested in a recently published C4 inscription from Vetren in Bulgaria ( SEG 43 486 = BCH 123 ( 1999 ) 246 -56 ). At Hdt. 7 . 109 . 2 Pistyros is called a polis twice, first in the territorial sense, denoting the town with its hinterland, next in (probably) the urban sense, perhaps with the territorial sense as a connotation. It is described as one of the coastal ηπειρώτιδες πόλεις of Thasos, qualified as ' Ελληνίς and παραθαλασσία , situated near a salt lake west of the Nestos estuary, on the route traversed by Xerxes' army through southern Thrace in 480 (Hdt. 7 . 109 -10 ). Pistyros has tentatively been identified with the remains of a C6l fortified settlement east of Pontolivado, located near the Vassova salt lake. Archaeological reports (Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1972 a ) 529 , ( 1973 ) 451 ; ( 1980 b ) 322 -25 ; cf. Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1990 )) record fortification walls with regular masonry of the 'Thasian' type, Thasian stamped amphoras and roof tiles stamped ΘΑΣΙΩΝ , indications of active metal working (silver), traces of buildings dating to C2 and an important coin hoard, containing coins of Neapolis and Thasos dated c. 520 -510 (Oikonomidou ( 1990 )). It is possible that the homonymous C5 -C4emporion excavated in the upper Hebros valley, near Vetren in Bulgaria (Velkov and Domaradzka ( 1994 ) = SEG 43 486 ) duplicated-or replaced-the coastal settlement, following the successful penetration of the Thasians deep into the Thracian hinterland (Loukopoulou ( 1999 ) 368 )."

The toponym is Αacuteβδηρα , τά (Anakreon fr. 505 , Page; Hdt. 8 . 120 ; Thuc. 2 . 97 . 1 ; IG iv² 1 94 . i b. 28 ) or, once, Αacuteβδηρος (Ephor. fr. 154 ) or, once, Αacuteβδηρα , ηasper (Diod. 31 . 8 . 8 ). The city-ethnic is Αβδηρίτης (Hecat. fr. 158 ; Hdt. 7 . 120 ; F.Delphes iii 1 497 . 2 (C4l-C3e)) or Αasperβδηρίτης ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 21 ). Abdera is called a polis both in the political sense (Anacr. fr. 100 = AG 7 . 226 ; Aen. Tact. 15 . 10 ) and in the urban sense (Hdt. 7 . 109 . 1 ; Thuc. 2 . 97 . 1 ; Aen. Tact. 15 . 9 ; Ps.-Skylax 67 ). At Thuc. 2 . 97 . 1 the territorial sense is a connotation. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 21 ) and in literary sources (Hdt. 7 . 120 ). The individual and external sense is used in reference to ∆η µ όκριτος οasper Αβδερίτης (Arist. Cael . 303 a 4 ) or Πρωταγόρας οasper Αβδηρίτης (Pl. Resp . 600 C) and a C5 Attic sepulchral monument ( IG i³ 1018 ). Abdera was a coastal city situated on the left (eastern) bank of the Nestos estuary (Hdt. 7 . 126 ), across the strait from Thasos, in a heavily marshy area often flooded by the river (Strabo 7 fr. 44 ; Casson ( 1926 ) 9 -10 ; Lazaridis ( 1971 b ) 2 ff). Originally, the area belonged to the neighbouring Thracian tribe of the Sintoi, known also as Saïoi or Sapaioi (Strabo 12 . 3 . 20 ). Despite the moorlands and the noxious climate (Mart. 10 . 25 ; cf. Cic. Att. 7 . 7 . 4 ; Lucian, Hist. conscr. 2 ; and numerous passages in the Hippocratic literature), Abdera came to own fertile agricultural land (Pind. fr. 52 b. 25 ) and fishing banks rich in cuttle fish and mullets (Archestratos frr. 43 , 56 , Olson and Sens) The city occupied one of the very few natural harbours east of the Nestos and had access to an important though probably rarely practicable land route linking the Aegean coast to the Thracian hinterland and to the Istros, probably through the modern Nymphaia pass (Thuc. 2 . 97 . 1 -3 ; cf. Samsaris ( 1980 ) 58 , 79 ). The territory of Abdera was called ηasper Αβδηρῖτις (Theophr. Hist . pl. 3 . 1 . 5 ) or ηasper Αβδηριτῶν χώρα (Aen.Tact. 15 . 8 ). During the Classical period it presumably extended from Lake Bistonis to the Nestos and from the Aegean coast to the northern end of the plain and the southern foot of Mt. Rhodope, roughly along the modern Xanthe-Toxotes motorway (Lazaridis ( 1971 b ) 2 nos. 5 -9 ; Samsaris ( 1980 ) 62 -63 ; Skarlatidou ( 1984 a ) 150 ; Isaac ( 1986 ) 73 ); it was crossed by the course of the river Kossinites, which flowed into Lake Bistonis (Ael. NA 15 . 25 ; identified with the river of Xanthi; Pantos ( 1975 -76 ), ( 1983 )). The territory of Abdera appears to have included at least one second named but unlocated urban centre, Bergepolis (Pantos ( 1975 -76 ) 3 , 10 , ( 1983 ) 166 , no. 8 ; see infra s.v.). The population of Abdera,the largest city in the northern Aegean coast, has been variously calculated as from 15 , 000 -20 , 000 to 40 , 000 -100 , 000 (Lazaridis ( 1971 b ) 33 -34 . 167 -70 ; Samsaris ( 1980 ) 167 ; Skarlatidou ( 1984 a ) 154 -55 ); on epigraphic evidence from Teos (Herrmann ( 1981 )), supported by the size of tribute paid by Teos and Abdera respectively, the latter's population was presumably 2 . 5 larger than that of her metropolis (Graham ( 1991 ), ( 1992 ) 59 ). Strabo's testimony at 3 . 4 . 3 concerning a homonymous Phoenician foundation in southern Spain led modern historians to suggest a Phoenician origin both for the toponym and for the initial foundation of Abdera (Isaac ( 1986 ) 76 -77 ). However,literary tradition records a first unsuccessful colonizing venture by Klazomenians under the leadership of Timesios (Hdt. 1 . 168 ; Plut. Mor . 812 A; Ael. VH 12 . 9 ) c. 650 (Solin. Coll. 10 . 10 ; Euseb. Chron. 95 b, Helm). That another early, yet equally unsuccessful, attempt was undertaken by the Thasians has been argued by Isaac ( 1986 ) 79 -80 on the basis of Archilochos' accounts of ferocious fights against Thracian Saioi ( = Sinties = Sapaiaoi). For a critical view, see Graham ( 1992 ) 48 . Abdera was eventually refounded in 544 by Teians fleeing from Persian rule (Hdt. 1 . 168 -69 ; Strabo 14 . 1 . 30 ; Ps.Skymnos 670 -71 ; cf. Isaac ( 1986 ) 81 -85 , with an interesting analysis of the poems of Anakreon, who participated in the foundation of the colony). Pindar's second Paian (Radt ( 1958 ); cf. Isaac ( 1986 ) 85 -86 ) records the colonists' successful struggles to establish and extend their territory until C6s, probably even C5m (Graham ( 1992 ) 62 -64 ); according to Strabo,some of the Teian refugees were eventually repatriated (Strabo 14 . 1 . 30 ; cf. V eligianni-T erzi ( 1997 ) 692 -93 ). The history of Abdera in the late Archaic and Classical periods has been largely reconstructed on the basis of the numerous and plentiful series of its important coinage by May ( 1966 ). However, recent numismatic research by Katerina Chryssanthaki (diss. Paris IV, 2000 ; forthcoming) has brought forth evidence which leads to a drastic revision of May's dates, and consequently of his historical reconstruction. In anticipation of Chryssanthaki's substantial revision of May's seriation and dating, the following account is based mainly on the testimony of literary, epigraphic and material sources other than the important numismatic evidence. Abdera rapidly grew into a major financial power. Its silver coinage, presumably initiated as early as c. 540 -35 (May ( 1966 ) 49 -58 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) 35 ; cf. however Chryssanthaki, forthcoming) and widely exported and distributed in the East, indicates direct access to rich silver-bearing Thracian regions (Mt. Symbolon, west of the Nestos or the Thracian hinterland?).Her growing rivalry with Thasos became manifest during the period of Persian occupation. Following Dareios'Skythian expedition,the Thasians were denounced by their neighbours for planning rebellion, and were ordered by Dareios to demolish their fortifications and bring their ships to Abdera (Hdt. 6 . 46 . 1 ), while the latter city was rewarded with the Persian king's trust and friendship (Hdt. 8 . 120 ). Under unknown circumstances and at an unspecified date Abdera joined the Delian League. Numismatic evidence during the period following the evacuation of the Persians appears to indicate a further increase of the city's opulence, especially following the sedition and fall of Thasos in 463 / 2 . Abdera belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . v . 5 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 30 ) a total of thirteen times, once completely restored, paying an exceptionally high phoros of mostly 15 tal. ( IG i³ 261 . v . 17 ) reduced to 10 tal. from 432 / 1 on ( IG i³ 280 . ii . 46 ). In 425 / 4 and 422 / 1 it was presumably assessed for tribute together with Dikaia ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 153 -4 and IG i³ 77 . iv . 29 -30 , city-ethnics completely restored), see infra . Abdera's opportunistic policies revived after the rise of the Odrysian power: with the Abderitan Nymphodoros as intermediary, she was the first to establish relations with the Odrysian royalty (Hdt. 7 . 137 . 3 ; Thuc. 2 . 29 . 1 , 5 ). The purpose was evidently to secure and develop her exploitation of Thracian resources, even under burdensome financial obligations. On the justifiably disputed tribute imposed on Abdera and other Greek cities of the northern Aegean by the Odrysians, see Veligianni ( 1995 a ) and Loukopoulou ( 2002 ). The same Nymphodoros extended his services by negotiating in 431 in favour of the Athenians the valuable alliance of the Odrysian king Sitalkes, not least the ephemeral rapprochement of Perdikkas, king of Macedonia ( Staatsverträge 165 ). The reduction of Abdera's tribute to the League by some 33 per cent in 432 / 1 may have been a reward in recognition of Nymphodoros'mediation (Isaac ( 1986 ) 102 ; for a different interpretation, see ATL iii. 310 -11 ). There is no satisfactory explanation of the marked reversal of this situation in 425 , when Abdera (with Dikaia) was assessed for the enormous sum of 75 tal. ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 153 -54 ). Dissatisfaction and unrest among Athen's allies in the northern Aegean resulted in Abdera's defection from the League, probably following the second secession of Thasos in 411 (Isaac ( 1986 ) 105 ). Abdera was brought back into the League by Thrasyboulos in 407 (Diod. 13 . 72 . 2 ; Xen. Hell. 1 . 4 . 9 ; cf. May ( 1966 ) 181 -83 ). In 376 / 5 Abdera fell victim to a massive invasion of Triballians, allegedly assisted-if not invited-by Maronitans; despite untrustworthy support by neighbouring Thracians, the city suffered enormous losses and was saved from complete devastation only thanks to the intervention of an Athenian squadron under Chabrias (Aen. Tact. 15 . 8 -10 ; Diod. 15 . 36 . 1 -4 ). An Athenian garrison was established, and Abdera became a member of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 .B. 3 = Tod 123 ; Diod. 15 . 36 . 3 -4 ; cf. schol. Ael. Arist. 172 . 7 , 173 . 17 ). Still suffering from the disastrous effects of her crushing defeat, the city was occupied by Philip II (Polyaen. Strat . 4 . 2 . 22 ; for diverging opinions on the date, see Isaac ( 1986 ) 106 ). In 346 / 5 Athens granted asylum to pro-Athenian refugees from Abdera ( IG ii² 218 ). Abdera seems to have persistently maintained close relations of affiliation with its metropolis, Teos, down to the Roman period. Characteristically, colony and mother city shared the same religious festivals (Herrmann ( 1981 ); Graham ( 1991 )); Abderitan coins (and amphora stamps; cf. Lazaridis ( 1954 ) 169 ) show that a griffin was the city emblem of both poleis , while occasional decrees promulgated in Teos are expressly proclaimed valid also for Abdera (Herrmann ( 1981 ) from Teos (C5f)); one contains public imprecations and seems to be a kind of citizen oath applying equally to Teians and Abderitans ( SEG 31 985 ). Also two decrees of Abdera were found in Teos (Herrmann ( 1971 ), ( 1981 )). In C5 the constitution was presumably democratic, as is indicated by the provision that confiscation of property, imprisonment and capital punishment could only be imposed by a court manned with a minimum of 500 citizens ( SEG 31 985 .A. 13 -22 ; Lewis ( 1982 )). Predictably, some at least of the institutions of Abdera reproduced those of its metropolis: most importantly, as in Teos, the board of executive magistrates in Abdera were the timouchoi (Bousquet ( 1940 -41 ) 100 -107 ; C3m, from Delphoi). As in Teos, the citizen body of Abdera appears to have been subdivided in smaller entities; the only one attested in Abdera may be a subdivision of a phyle , perhaps a genos ; see ' Ερ µ ῶναξ ∆ιονυσαtildeδος Ευρυσθενίδης in a C4l dedication (Kallintzi and Veligianni ( 1996 ); SEG 46 841 ). The eponymous official was presumably the priest of Apollo, at least after C4m (Lazaridis ( 1971 b ) 27 , 140 ; Thrace ( 1994 ) 61 ). The names engraved on Abderitan coins ( επιgrave τουtilde δεῖνος ) are usually interpreted as those of annual(?) mint officials. One C5s moneyer, ∆η µ όκριτος , is often identified with the preSocratic philosopher of Abdera (Isaac ( 1986 ) 103 ). Other institutions, including the boule and demos of Abdera (Herrmann ( 1981 )) and magistracies, are only expressly attested in epigraphic sources of Heltic and Roman date. AnAbderitan ambassador is said to have been sent to the king of Sparta, Agis, son of Archidamos, in the latter part of C4 (Plut. Mor . 215 E). Abderitans are awarded proxenia by Athens ( IG ii² 77 ( 378 / 7 ); SEG 35 71 ( 332 / 1 )) and Kolophon ( AJP 56 ( 1935 ) 363 l. 142 (C4l)). In 370 / 69 , a golden crown is recorded as offered by the Abderitans to the godess of Athens ( IG ii² 1425 . 119 ( 370 / 69 )). In 359 the city had a theorodokos to host theoroi from Epidauros ( IG iv²1 . 94 . i b. 28 ). Our knowledge of Abderitan legislation is limited to a C5 Abderitan law forbidding the burial of persons who had dispersed the family fortune, recorded in connection with Demokritos (Ath. 4 . 168 b), and a C4 regulation concerning the marketing of cattle (Feyel ( 1942 -43 ) 180 , no. 2 ). Pindar's second Paian evokes the organisation of the army (with emphasis on cavalry units) in the first days of the establishment of the colony (Pind.fr. 52 b. 104 ; cf. Isaac ( 1986 ) 85 -86 ). Some indications of the importance of its size can be obtained in relation to the battles fought in 376 against the invading Triballians (Lazaridis ( 1971 b ) 33 -34 nos. 168 -70 ). The poliad deity of Abdera was probably Dionysos, frequently mentioned by Anakreon (Isaac ( 1986 ) 82 -85 ). Also important was the cult of Apollo, evoked with the eponym Derainos or Derenos in Pindar's second Paian (Pind. fr. 52 b. 5 ) and regularly portrayed on C4 coinage (Isaac ( 1986 ) 84 n. 65 , 106 -7 ). Also attested in epigraphic and literary sources is the celebration of Thesmophoria, Anthesteria, Herakleia and the festival of Zeus (Herrmann ( 1981 )), the cult of Athena Epipyrgitis, probably imported from the metropolis Teos (Lazaridis ( 1971 b ) 27 no. 138 ; Skarlatidou ( 1984 a ) 158 ), that of Aphrodite and Hekate (Pind. fr. 52 b. 5 ; 78 ; cf. Isaac ( 1986 ) 107 -8 ), and a grove dedicated to the Nymphs near the city wall (Lazaridis ( 1971 b ) 41 no. 206 ); for the discovery of a C4l-C3e sanctuary presumably of Demeter or Kore, see Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1982 ) 3 , ( 1983 ) 7 ; Skarlatidou ( 1984 a ) 159 ; Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1987 b ) 180 -82 , ( 1988 ) 143 -45 , ( 1989 ) 222 -23 , ( 1992 ) 165 -66 ). Further attested are the heroic cult of Abderos, celebrated with athletic contests, excluding horse and chariot events (Philostr. 2 . 25 ; presumably to be identified with the hero Mesopolites Epenor (Kallintzi and Veligianni ( 1996 ) 62 ), and that of Timesios the Klazomenian ktistes of the first colony at Abdera (Hdt. 1 . 168 ); in C4s, Parmenion is said to have built a temple for Jason (Strabo 11 . 14 . 12 ), Abdera has been identified beyond any doubt with the archaeological site near Cape Bouloustra (with visible remains of the modest Byzantine town Polystylon on its south-west end), some 7 km south-west of the homonymous (formerly Bouloustra) modern village (Reinach ( 1881 ); Regel ( 1887 ); Kazarow ( 1918 )). Despite dramatic geomorphological mutations of the lowlands from the alluvial activity and the westward movement of the Nestos estuary (cf.Strabo 7 fr. 43 ), recent excavations have uncovered parts of the Archaic and Classical polis , located further north of Cape Bouloustra,presumably on a promontory linked to the mainland by a narrow strip with natural bays to the east and west: identified are parts of two early phases (C7s-C5 : Kokouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1987 b) 177 -83 ) of fortification walls protecting the city's portuary installations (a neosoikos ?), remains of an important public building (Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1991 ) 200 -1 ), traces of C6 -C4 houses and the C7s-C6f (Klazomenian) cemetery (Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1997 )). A vast Late Classical-Classical tumuli necropolis extended to the north and north-west (Romiopoulou ( 1964 ) 377 ; Lazaridis ( 1965 ) 460 -61 ; Triantaphyllos ( 1973 -74 ) 809 -10 ; KoukouliChryssanthaki ( 1982 ) 9 -16 ; Triantaphyllos ( 1975 ) 297 -98 ). Two gates are known from literary tradition: the Thracian (Hippocr. 3 . 3 . 17 ) and the Prourides (Callimach. 4 . 90 ). Due undoubtedly to the changing geomorphology, the site was abandoned in C4m (Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1987 a ) 412 ), and the city was relocated further south, where systematic excavations since the early 1950 s have revealed segments of the C4fortifications with a gate, and several insulae of Heltic and Roman dwellings. The walls enclosed an area of 112 ha, and the city was apparantly grid-planned from its foundation (Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 180 -87 ). Only undated traces of the theatre ( TGR ii. 115 ) were identified (Lazaridis ( 1971 b ) 38 no. 193 ; Lazaridis ( 1966 ) 359 -61 ; Triantaphyllos ( 1984 ) 32 -33 ), but it is attested in a C2 inscription (Avezou and Picard ( 1913 ) 122 -24 , 128 -29 ; BCH 37 ( 1913 ) 122 -37 (C2 )) and mentioned by Lucian in a C4l-C3e context ( Hist. conscr . 1 ). The palaistra (Hippocr. 6 . 8 . 30 : palaistrophylax ) remains unidentified. Abdera struck high-quality coins from C6s and throughout the entire Classical period. Its mint was one of the most important and enjoyed a wide circulation. Seriation and dating of this coinage, established by May's exhaustive study ( 1966 ), has now been drastically revised following important evidence mainly from coin hoards discovered in various parts of the East (Price and Waggoner ( 1975 ); Mattingly ( 1977 )). Since the results of recent research are still unpublished (cf. supra 873 ), it is preferable to refrain from reproducing May's conclusions and limit the presentation to a summary description of the coin types.Abdera struck silver coins on variable weight standards, of mostly large denominations: octadrachm, tetradrachm, didrachm, drachm and subdivisions. Type: obv . griffin to left (Abdera's city emblem,as opposed to that of Teos: griffin facing right), often accompanied by various symbols (May ( 1966 ) 86 ); rev . incuse square and later various representations (portraits or full-length representations of deities-in particular Dionysos-and symbols thereof, animals or birds, objects, fruits).Legend:full or abreviated name of annual magistrate in the nominative or in the genitive case after ΕΠΙ ; also, at times, the city-ethnic ΑΒ∆Η or ΑΒ∆ΗΡΙΤΕΩΝ . In addition to the silver coins there were limited bronze emissions from C5l, presumably for local use, and in C4m a limited emission of gold coins ( SNG Cop.Thrace 308 -73 )."
641,Ainos (Ainios),Thrace from Nestos to Hebros,40.45,26.05,1434,7113,"641 . Ainos (Ainios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 45 , long. 26 . 05 . Size of territory: probably 4 or 5 . Type A: α . The toponym is Αῖνος , ηasper (Hom. Il. 4 . 520 : Αινόθεν ; Hdt. 4 . 90 . 2 ; Ant. 5 . 20 ; Thuc. 4 . 28 . 4 ; Ps.-Skylax; IG iv²1 94 . i b. 30 ( 359 )). The city-ethnic is Αίνιος ( IG i³ 260 . vi . 15 ; F.Delphes iii . 1 497 . 6 (C4l-C3e); Thuc. 7 . 57 . 5 ) or Αινειευacuteς (Hipponax fr. 72 . 7 , West). Ainos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 4 . 90 . 2 , 7 . 58 . 3 ; Ephor. fr. 39 ; Ps.-Skylax 67 ) and in the political sense (Ant. 5 . 78 ). The town is called polisma at Ephor. fr. 39 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and externally in inscriptions ( IG ii² 43 .B. 7 = Tod 123 ) and literary sources (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 5 ; Dem. 23 . 119 ). For the individual and external form,see IG ii² 152 (C4f); SEG 38217 , Athens (C4 ); IG iv² 1 58 . 7 , Epidauros (C4l-C3e); Arist. Pol . 1311 b 21 . Ainos was situated in the Melas Gulf, at the mouth of the Hebros delta (Strabo 7 fr. 52 ), commanding the exit of the vast Hebros plain and lowlands famous for their fertility (Plin. HN 18 . 7 . 70 ). It was apparently situated in close proximity to the Lake Stentoris (Hdt. 7 . 58 . 3 ), on what was probably a peninsula and is known to have possessed a well-protected harbour (Ps.-Skylax 67 ), probably a river harbour on Lake Stentoris = Gala Gölu (Plin. HN 4 . 43 : portus Stentoris ). For sketch plans of the Hebros delta, cf. May ( 1950 ) figs. 1 -3 ). The harbour served communications both with the Aegean and with the Thracian hinterland, as the river must have been easily navigable (May ( 1950 ) 1 -7 ; Isaac ( 1986 ) 140 -46 ). The area was also renowned for its fishing banks rich in large mussels, anchovy and pig-fish (Archestratos frr. 7 , 23 , Olson and Sens; cf. May ( 1950 ) 6 ). The extent of the territory of Ainos is unknown; attested however is the existence of dependent forts ( teiche ) on the Thracian littoral south of Ainos and north of the mouth of the river Melas (Ps.-Skylax 67 ). Ainos is already known in the Iliad ( 4 . 519 -20 ); and according to Hipponax (fr. 741 , Diehl ( c. 540 -537 )) the legendary king Rhesos was king of the Ainians. Ainos was an Aiolian colony (Hdt. 7 . 58 . 3 ), first established, presumably in C7s or C6f (Isaac ( 1986 ) 147 -48 ) by Alopekonnesians,subsequently reinforced by Mytilenaians and Kymaians (Ephor. fr. 39 ; Ps.-Skymnos 697 ; Strabo 7 fr. 51 ) on land (Apsinthis) owned by the Thracian Apsinthioi, later known as Korpiloi (Strabo 7 fr. 57 ; cf. fr. 51 a). Undoubtedly occupied by the Persians in C6l, it recovered its independence under unknown circumstances after 480 and joined the Delian League as a tribute-paying member (Thuc. 5 . 57 . 5 ; cf. May ( 1950 ) 14 ). It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . i . 23 ) to 436 / 5 ( IG i³ 276 . vi . 29 ) a total of fourteen times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 12 tal. ( IG i³ 260 . vi . 15 ) reduced to 10 tal. after 445 ( IG i³ 267 . iii . 2 ) and finally 4 tal. in 435 ( IG i³ 276 . vi . 29 ). In 425 Ainos was presumably assessed at 20 tal. ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 159 , ethnic completely restored). The reasons for the tribute fluctuations as well as for the absence of Ainos from the full panels of 435 / 4 ( IG i³ 277 ), 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 ) and 429 ( IG i³ 282 ) remain obscure (Meiggs ( 1972 ) 249 ; Isaac ( 1986 ) 151 -52 ). The army of Ainos included peltasts before the end of C5 (cf. Thuc. 4 . 28 . 4 (r 425 )), and Ainian forces are recorded as having participated in the expedition of Sicily (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 5 ). In 375 , with Athens once more the undisputed mistress of the Aegean, Ainos became a member of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 .B. 7 ; cf. May ( 1950 ) 187 ). Yet, numismatic evidence has been interpreted as indicating a decline of prosperity since early C4 , undoubtedly aggravated since 365 under the pressure of Odrysian expansionism over south-eastern Thrace and the Thracian Chersonesos (May ( 1950 ) 174 -94 ). The adverse situation was temporarily averted when Kotys I ( 383 / 2 -359 ) was murdered by two Ainian citizens, Python and Herakleides, who were handsomely rewarded by the Athenians (Dem. 23 . 119 ; Arist. Pol . 1311 b 22 ). However, the improved relations between Athens and the successors of Kotys could not forestall Philip II's successful advance in Thrace.Renewed aggression by the Odrysians and burdensome contributions imposed by the Athenians could be exploited by a pro-Makedonian faction, active in Ainos at least since 344 / 3 . As a result, Ainos went over to the Makedonian king c. 342 or shortly thereafter and accepted a Makedonian garrison (Dem. 58 . 37 -38 ; cf. May ( 1950 ) 195 -203 ; Gehrke, Stasis 16 ; Isaac ( 1986 ) 154 -55 ). In 359 Ainos had a theorodokos to host theoroi from Epidauros ( IG iv²1 94 . i b. 30 ). The two Ainians who killed the Odrysian king Kotys in 359 were awarded Athenian citizenship and proxeny (Dem. 23 . 119 ; Arist. Pol. 1311 b ); Timaphenides of Ainos was granted proxenia in Athens before 353 / 2 ( IG ii² 152 ). In 303 / 2 another Ainian, Alkaios, son of Heraios, was granted Athenian citizenship, proxenia and a golden crown in Athens ( IG ii² 495 ); furthermore, he was honoured with the proxenia, ateleia and asylia in Epidauros ( IG iv² 158 ). The poliad deity of Ainos was most probably Hermes Perpheraios, whose wooden statue, a work of Epeios, was washed up at the neighbouring coast,where a sanctuary was presumably built in his honour (Callim. Ia . 7 fr. 197 , Pfeiffer; cf. May ( 1950 ) 272 -73 for C5 coin representations). Pan and the Nymphs depicted on a C4 relief were presumably worshipped in a cave at the foot of the acropolis (Casson ( 1926 ) 257 -58 ). Also presumed from epigraphic, numismatic and literary evidence are the cults of Dionysos, the legendary king Rhesos and Asklepios (Isaac ( 1986 ) with refs.). The town of Ainos is securely identified with Byzantine and modern Ainos (Turkish Enez) on the left bank of the Hebros river; it is now, following extensive geomorphological changes and the formation of a sand-bar blocking the river's mouth, situated 2 . 5 km upstream from the modern coastline, surrounded by marshes and lagoons (Hasluck ( 1908 -9 ) 249 -51 ; Casson ( 1926 ) 256 -57 ; May ( 1950 ) 1 -2 ). The ancient site is hidden under the modern town, and archaeological remains are sporadic. The coinage of Ainos, of great artistic excellence, was initiated shortly after the departure of the Persians. Ainos struck coins in gold, silver and bronze. ( 1 ) Silver, c. 478 -341 : denominations: tetradrachm, drachm, tetrobol, diobol; type: obv . head of Hermes, in C4 often facing; rev . goat with various symbols. Legend: ΑΙ or ΑΙΝΙ or ΑΙΝΙΟΝ . Sometimes name of magistrate. ( 2 ) Bronze, C5s: type: obv . head of Hermes; rev . caduceus.Legend: ΑΙΝΙ or ΑΙΝΙΟΝ . ( 3 ) Gold, C4f: type: obv . head of Hermes; rev . Hermes on throne (May ( 1950 ); Mattingly ( 1977 ) 99 -101 ; SNG Cop. Thrace 389 -421 )."

If this entry can be trusted, Bergepolis was an urban centre dependent on Abdera.The second part of the composite toponym suggests that it was a polis : viz ., a dependent polis lying in the territory of Abdera. Otherwise unknown, Bergepolis has been tentatively located-on no conclusive evidence-at the ancient site identified between Koutson and Vafeïka ( TIR 21 with refs.; Triantaphyllos ( 1973 -74 ) 810 -13 , and, more recently, Skarlatidou ( 1990 ) 616 ). The excavation report mentions sparse ceramic finds from the Archaic to the Roman period, as well as coins of Abdera of the Classical period. If one accepts the identification of Bergepolis with this site, the presumption is that Bergepolis' status as a polis goes back at least to the Classical period."
643,Dikaia,Thrace from Nestos to Hebros,41.0,25.1,853,4170,"643 . Dikaia Map 51 . Lat. 41 . 00 , long. 25 . 10 . Size of territory: 2 or 3 . Type: A: α . The toponym is ∆ίκαια , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 109 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 67 ; IG i³ 263 . iii . 19 : ∆ίκαια παραgrave Αacuteβδερα ) or ∆ικαιόπολις , ηasper (Harp. ∆ 64 , quoting Lysias fr. 115 , Sauppe; cf. Suda ∆ 1967 ). Apart from Steph. Byz. 230 . 15 there is no attestation of a city-ethnic. Dikaia is listed as a polis in the urban sense alongside Abdera and Maroneia at Hdt. 7 . 109 . 1 and Ps-Skylax 67 . Polis status in the political sense is confirmed by her coinage ( infra ) and membership of the Delian League ( infra ). According to Herodotos ( 7 . 109 . 1 ) Dikaia was situated on the Thracian coast between Abdera and Maroneia, near Lake Bistonis and west of the river Koudetos (Ps.-Skylax 67 , to be identified with Herodotos'river Kompsatos,according to ATL i. 517 ). According to Strabo 7 frr. 43 and 46 , it lay in a bay near the sea-ward side of the lake, which served her as a port. It was situated in the vicinity of the legendary palace of Diomedes, king of the Bistones, and off the sea-ward canal of Lake Bistonis allegedly cut by Herakles. Usually sought south or south-east of Porto Lagos ( ATL i. 517 ; cf. Bakalakis ( 1958 ) 89 -90 ), Dikaia has been locatedyet without any conclusive archaeological or epigraphic evidence (Isaac ( 1986 ) 109 )-on a low hill named Katsamakia, a few kilometers north of Cape Phanari (Bakalakis ( 1958 ) 89 ; Lazaridis ( 1971 b ) 45 no. 223 ). At this site were found traces of part of a C4fortification wall and sparse remains of Heltic houses (Bakalakis ( 1958 ) 68 ; Triantaphyllos ( 1972 ) 535 ). Some C6l-C5sepulchral tumuli found west of Katsamakia have been attributed to the city's cemetery (Triantaphyllos ( 1972 ) 535 , ( 1973 ); for a tentative demarcation of the territory of Dikaia, see Lazaridis ( 1971 b ) 46 no. 225 ). On the uncertain evidence of sparse archaeological remains and the modest amount of tribute, the population of Dikaia was estimated as a maximum of 1 , 000 inhabitants (Samsaris ( 1980 ) 168 ; cf. Lazaridis ( 1971 b ) 51 no. 243 ). Dikaia was probably founded in C6 , but, in the absence of literary testimonia, the origin and foundattion date remain obscure (Isaac ( 1986 ) 109 -10 ). The bull's head on Dikaia's coins in 492 has been taken to indicate a Samian origin or, more probably,financial relations with Samos (May ( 1965 )). Dikaia was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 28 ) to 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . ii . 60 ) a total of thirteen times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 3 , 000 dr. from 454 / 3 to 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 44 ), reduced to 2 , 000 dr. in 446 / 5 ( IG i³ 266 . ii . 8 ) but raised again to 3 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 280 . ii . 60 ) perhaps in 435 / 4 ( IG i³ 277 . vi . 19 , amount restored). In 425 / 4 and 422 / 1 it was presumably assessed for tribute together with Abdera ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 153 -4 and IG i³ 77 . iv . 29 -30 ). In 425 / 4 the two members were assessed at the enormous sum of 75 tal. From C6s to the end of Persian occupation in the area, c. 476 , Dikaia minted two series of silver coins of excellent workmanship. ( 1 ) Series I was struck C6l-480 on the Thrako-Makedonian standard of Thasos. Denominations: tetradrachm, stater and subdivisions. Type: obv . head of Herakles; rev . incuse square. ( 2 ) Series II was struck 480 -476 on the Thrako-Makedonian standard of Maroneia, probably in accordance with the city's changing political and financial dependencies (May ( 1965 )). Denominations: didrachm, drachm and subdivisions. Type: obv . head of Herakles; rev . cock or bull's head. Legend: ∆ or ∆ΙΚ or ∆ΙΚΑΙ . ( 3 ) A series of drachms was struck in C5m. Type: obv . female head, hair rolled; rev . bull's head.

644,Drys (Dryites),Thrace from Nestos to Hebros,40.05,25.4,416,2030,"644 . Drys (Dryites) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 05 , long. 25 . 40 . Size of territory: probably 2 or 3 . Category: B:? The toponym is ∆ρυtildeς , ηasper (Hecat. fr. 160 ; Ps.-Skylax 67 ; Dem. 23 . 132 ; IG i³ 77 . v . 29 -30 : ∆ρυtildeς παραgrave Σέρρειον ). The city-ethnic is ∆ρυίτης ( F.Delphes iii . 1 497 . 5 (C4l-C3e)).According to Ps.Skylax 67 , Drys and Zone were emporia lying on the coast opposite Samothrake. Drys is classified as a polis only in late sources (Polyaen. Strat . 2 . 22 . 3 (r 375 ); Harp. ∆ 82 ; Suda ∆ 1551 ; Steph. Byz. 240 . 3 ). Harpokration is quoting Theopompos (fr. 161 ) and Stephanos Hekataios (fr. 160 ), but in neither case is it possible to ascertain that the site-classification as a polis stems from the author quoted. In the Athenian assessment decree of 422 / 1 Drys is listed as a member of the Delian League and assessed at 1 tal. ( IG i³ 77 . 5 . 29 -30 ). In a Delphic inscription of C4l or C3e, the ethnic ∆ρυῖται is listed alongside other ethnics which are indisputably city-ethnics ( F. Delphes iii . 1 479 . 5 ). The presumption is that Dryites is a cityethnic too. Thus, Drys appears to have been a polis from C5s to, perhaps, C3e (Robert ( 1940 ) 81 -87 ). Apart from its membership of the Delian League,the only information we have about the history of Drys is that it was a fortified town which in 375 was besieged by the Athenians under Chabrias (Polyaen. Strat . 2 . 22 . 3 ), and that in c. 360 it was the home of the Athenian strategos Iphikrates (Dem. 23 . 132 ). Drys is believed to have been absorbed by Traianoupolis under the empire (Isaac ( 1986 ) 129 ). Drys is tentatively but unconvincingly identified by some scholars with Mesambria (Perdrizet ( 1909 ) 35 ) or with Orthagoria ( ATL i. 519 ) and in turn located south-west of Dikella (Kazarow ( 1918 ) 52 -55 ; ATL i. 518 -19 ; Bakalakis ( 1961 ) 15 -16 et al. ), at Shabla Dere = infra Zone (Meyer ( 1976 ); cf. however Robert ( 1940 ) 86 -87 and, more recently, Isaac ( 1986 ) 129 -30 and Mottas ( 1989 ) 89 , 103 )."

The toponym is Κυacuteψελα , τά (Damoxenos fr. 1 . 5 , PCG ; Steph. Byz. 400 . 7 ); Apart from Steph. Byz. 400 . 8 -9 there is no attestation of a city-ethnic. Kypsela is classified as a polis only in late sources (Polyaen. Strat . 4 . 16 : Κυacuteψελα ΘρΩsubiotaάτταν πόλιν ; Strabo 7 fr. 10 ; Steph. Byz. 400 . 7 ; Ptol. 3 . 11 . 7 ). The polis status of Kypsela in C4l-C3e is known exclusively from its short-lived bronze coinage. Type: obv . head of Hermes; rev . beehive-type vase. Legend: ΚΥΨΕ . Stylistic and iconographic parallels and chronology ( c. 415 -387 ) seem to suggest a former dependency on Ainos and a short period of self-government followed by Odrysian rule at least since c. 390 -380 (Schönert-Geiss ( 1993 ); SNG Cop. Thrace 532 ). Kypsela was located near the (left) bank of the Hebros, some 120 stades upstream from the river's mouth (Strabo 7 fr. 47 ), 25 miles east of Traianoupolis on the Via Egnatia ( It. Burd. 602 . 5 ; 29 miles according to the It. Ant. 332 . 2 ); it is identified with modern Ipsala (Turkey)."
646,Maroneia (Maronites),Thrace from Nestos to Hebros,40.5,25.3,1665,8426,"646 . Maroneia (Maronites) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 50 , long. 25 . 30 . Size of territory: probably 5 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Μαρώνεια , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 109 . 1 ; Archestratos fr. 56 , Olson and Sens; IG iv²1 94 . i b. 29 , Epidauros ( 359 ); SEG 43 486 . 21 , Bulgaria (C4m)).The toponym evidently recalls Maron,son of Euanthes, Apollo's priest at Homeric Ismaros (Hom. Od . 9 . 197 ; C5f coins ( infra )); the probable linguistic connection between Maroneia and Ismaros is underlined by Isaac ( 1986 ) 113 n. 224 . The city-ethnic is Μαρωνίτης ( IG i³ 260 . vi . 19 ; Xen. An . 7 . 3 . 16 ; SEG 43 486 . 27 -8 , Bulgaria) or Μαρωνευacuteς ( IG i³ 263 . iii . 22 ) or Μαρωνειευacuteς ( IG i³ 269 . iii . 6 ). Maroneia is called a polis in the urban sense by Hekataios (fr. 159 ), Herodotos ( 7 . 109 . 1 ) and Ps.-Skylax ( 67 ). The political sense is attested in IG ii² 43 . 78 and 87 where Maroneia, under the heading πόλεις , is listed as one of the members of the Second Athenian Naval League. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 260 . vi . 19 ) and in literary sources (Dem. 50 . 20 -23 ). For the individual and external use, see the funerary inscriptions IG ii² 9286 -93 from Athens and Xen. An . 7 . 3 . 16 . The city's territory extended according to Lazaridis (( 1972 ) 4 and plan 21 ) from the slopes of Mt. Ismaros in the east to the course of the river Philiouri (probably identified with the ancient Lissos) and the banks of Lake Ismaris in the west and to the river Kourou and the northern slopes of Mt. Ismaros to the north, but Pantos claims that it must at times have been far more extended, including Stryme to the west (Pantos ( 1983 ) 168 para. 14 ). The C5s population of Maroneia,a vast and prosperous city,is estimated at c. 12 , 000 (Lazaridis ( 1972 ) 14 . 44 -45 , with refs.), or at 15 , 000 -20 , 000 (Samsaris ( 1980 ) 167 -68 ). Maroneia was situated on a coastal plateau east of Stryme and Lake Ismaris = lake of Mitrikon (Hdt. 7 . 109 . 1 ; Strabo 7 fr. 44 ) and west of Orthagoria (Strabo 7 fr. 48 ; Plin. HN 4 . 42 : between Dikaia and Cape Serreion), on the fertile vinegrowing slopes of Mt. Ismaros ( Suda Ι 645 , Μ 222 ; Eust. Od . 1 . 133 . 9 ; cf. Hom. Od. 9 . 196 -211 ; Archiloch. fr. 2 ; Plin. HN 14 . 53 -54 ). The exclusive testimony of Ps.-Skymnos ( 675 -78 ) referring to Maroneia as a colony of Chios is usually accepted (Isaac ( 1986 ) 114 ). Its foundation is dated before C7m,when Maronitans clashed with Thasians over the possession of Stryme (Archiloch. fr. 2 , quoted by Philoch. fr. 43 ). The city fell undoubtedly under Persian rule following the occupation of Thrace by Megabazos. With the Persian rule terminated under unspecified circumstances (Isaac ( 1986 ) 115 -16 with bibliography) Maroneia predictably entered the Delian League. It belonged to the Thracian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 5 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . iii . 19 ) a total of twenty times. It paid a phoros of 1 tal. 3 , 000 dr. down to 443 / 2 ( IG i³ 269 . iii . 6 ) or perhaps 441 / 0 ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 44 ). From 436 / 5 it paid 10 tal. ( IG i³ 276 . v . 29 ), reduced to 3 , 000 dr. in 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . ii . 8 ). In 425 / 4 it was presumably assessed at the enormous sum of 21 tal. ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 156 , city-ethnic restored). Moreover, numismatic evidence suggests close financial and political relations with the Odrysian kingdom. On the justifiably disputed tribute imposed on Abdera and other Greek cities of the northern Aegean by the Odrysians, see Veligianni ( 1995 a ) with refs. and Loukopoulou ( 2003 ). In C4 , Maroneia became a member of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 . 87 ). Moreover,its relations with the Odrysians were further strengthened in C4f, as was the antagonism with other powerful Greek cities of the north Aegean who had financial interests in the Thracian hinterland. C. 400 a Maronitan served as a councillor at the court of Seuthes II (Xen. An . 7 . 3 . 16 ). In 376 / 5 Maroneia is believed to have supported, if not invited, the Triballian invasion which resulted in the catastrophic defeat of Abdera (Diod. 15 . 36 . 3 -4 ; cf. schol. Ael. Arist. 172 . 7 , 173 . 17 ). She had apparently also succeeded in driving Thasos away from Stryme, and the dispute was solved only with Athenian intervention (Dem. 12 . 17 , 17 . 23 , 50 . 20 -23 , 51 . 17 ). A recently published inscription from Vetren in Bulgaria discloses the privileged position of Maroneia in the Thracian commerce under Kotys I and his successors ( SEG 43 486 ; Velkov and Domaradzka ( 1994 ); cf. Loukopoulou ( 1999 ), ( 2002 ), 2003 )); it was brought to an end by Philip II's conquest of southern Thrace and the dissolution once and for all of the Odrysian power (Dem. 23 . 183 ; Polyaen. Strat. 4 . 2 . 22 ). Maroneia's triremes and army, which included mercenaries and 'neighbouring barbarians'are mentioned in relation to her dispute with Thasos over Stryme in 361 (Dem. 50 . 14 -15 , 20 -23 ). We have no information about the constitution of Maroneia. Maronitan ambassadors are recorded in 361 / 0 (Dem. 50 . 20 -23 ). In 359 Maroneia had a theorodokos to host theoroi from Epidauros ( IG iv²1 94 . i b. 29 ). In C4 Karthaia bestowed proxenia on a citizen of Maroneia ( IG xii 5 242 .b. 2 ). I.Priene 10 (C4 ) is a decree by Priene (no. 861 ) bestowing various judicial privileges on citizens of Maroneia. A citizen of Maroneia was Olympic victor in 476 ( Olympionikai 213 ). The poliad deity of Maroneia was most probably Dionysos, whose portrait appears on coins; his sanctuary (Dionysion) was the place of publication of official documents ( SEG 35 823 . 43 -4 (C2 )). With Dionysos' cult was apparently associated that of the city's eponymous hero Maron (cf.the legend ΜΑΡΩΝΟΣ on C5f coins ( infra )), as indicated by their joint cult, along with that of Zeus and Rome,in the Roman period (Triantaphyllos ( 1983 ) 425 ). The cult of Apollo is presumed on legendary evidence (Hom. Od . 9 . 187 -215 ). The town of Maroneia is securely located in the wellprotected bay of Ag. Charalambos, which also served as the city harbour. A vast 10 . 5 km-long fortification wall protected the entire area from the port, west of the bay (reinforced to the east by an artificial mole; cf. Sarla-Pentazou and Pentazos ( 1984 ) 47 figs. 2 -3 , 5 -6 ), to the acropolis, identified on the hill of Ag. Athanasios (height 678 m). Archaeological research has not yet identified traces of the ArchaicClassical city. The isodomic city wall was reinforced with numerous semicircular and rectangular towers.Also identified are a C4sanctuary, presumably of Dionysos, and the sanctuary of the Egyptian deities (Tsimbidis-Pentazos ( 1971 ) 104 , ( 1973 ) 84 -86 fig. 1 ; Pentazos ( 1982 ) 29 -30 ; SarlaPentazou and Pentazos ( 1984 ) 48 fig. 10 ; Lazaridis ( 1972 ) 40 . 140 ; Pentazos ( 1986 ); Ergon ( 1973 ) 59 -61 , ( 1986 -87 ) 44 -45 , ( 1987 ) 20 -22 ; Triantaphyllos ( 1983 ) 431 -32 ). In C6l Maroneia struck a limited series of silver coins on the Thrako-Makedonian standard. Denominations: stater, tetrobol, diobol and obol. Type: obv . horse protome; rev . incuse square.In the Classical period silver coins were struck first on the Phoenician standard, later on the Persian standard, sometimes on the Attic standard. Denominations from C5e on: didrachm, drachm, triobol, diobol, trihemiobol. Types: obv . forepart of horse, or prancing horse, or head of Dionysos; rev . first, incuse square; later, vine or grapes in square. Legend: c. 500 on obv . ΜΑ or ΜΑΡΩ or ΜΑΡΩΝΟΣ , later on rev . ΜΑ or ΜΑΡΩ but mostly ΜΑΡΩΝΙΤΕΩΝ or later ΜΑΡΩΝΙΤΩΝ and often a magistrate's name. The same types appear on bronze coins and on two series of gold coins struck in C4f (Head, HN ² 248 -50 ; Schönert-Geiss ( 1987 ) 46 -47 ; SNG Cop. Thrace 592 -633 ). The dating, seriation and distribution of the important coinage of Maroneia, as well as the systematic study of its impact on political and financial developments in Thrace and on the Odrysian coinage, have been based on the mints of Abdera and Ainos (May ( 1965 ); West ( 1929 ) 55 -147 ; Schönert-Geiss ( 1979 ), ( 1985 ), ( 1987 ); Peter ( 1997 ) passim ). As a consequence of the revision of Abdera's monetary history (no. 640 ), historical conclusions are now open to reconsideration."

The toponym, Μεσα µ βρίη , ηasper , is attested exclusively by Herodotos ( 7 . 108 . 2 , quoted at Steph. Byz. 446 . 19 -21 : Μεση µ βρία ). Herodotos describes Mesambrie as the westernmost teichos of the peraia of Samothrake and,at the same time,as a polis both in the urban sense and in the territorial sense, viz . as bordering on the polis of Stryme and the river Lissos. It was situated in the Briantike, formerly called Gallaïke, a part of the region formerly owned by the Kikones. Herodotos' description indicates that Mesambria was a dependent polis belonging to Samothrake. Mesambrie was tentatively but unconvincingly identified by some scholars with Drys (Perdrizet ( 1909 ) 35 ; cf. Seure ( 1900 ) 152 n. 1 ), by others with Orthagoria (Meyer ( 1976 ) 3 , ( 1978 ) 97 -98 ) or with Zone ( Thrace ( 1994 ) 80 ). For an early discussion of proposed unjustified identifications,simplifying the admittedly confused settlement pattern transmitted by literary sources for this area, see Robert ( 1940 ) and, more recently, Isaac ( 1986 ) 128 -33 . Mesambrie has persistently been identified with the site systematically excavated near the stream Shabla Dere (Kazarow ( 1918 ) 33 ; Amandry ( 1940 -41 ); Walter ( 1942 ) 189 -90 ); Bakalakis ( 1961 ) 15 ; Lazaridis ( 1971 c ) 39 ; supported by the excavator of the site, A. Vavritsas, and followed by Barr .). But this identification has now been abandoned in favour of Zone (Tsatsopoulou ( 1995 ) 671 -73 ; cf. TIR 37 ; Isaac ( 1986 ) 131 ; disputed by Soustal ( 1991 ) 354 -55 ; see infra 881 ). Mesambrie should be sought 3 km further west, at the mouth of the stream Yali Dere (Meyer ( 1976 ) 3 ; ( 1978 ) 97 -98 ; Mottas ( 1989 ) 89 )."

The toponym is Σάλη , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 59 . 2 ; IG i³ 77 . 5 . 31 ( 422 / 1 )). The city-ethnic remains unattested. According to Herodotos, Sale and Zone were Samothrakean poleis (in the urban sense), situated on the coast of the Doriskos plain, in the region formerly owned by the Kikones. Like other cities of the peraia of Samothrake it appears in 422 / 1 as a member of the Delian League, assessed at 3 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 77 . 5 . 31 ). Sale was situated 15 miles west of Traianoupolis on the Via Egnatia ( It. Burd. 602 . 9 : mutatio Salei ) and is tentatively, but not beyond reasonable doubt, located at or near modern Alexandroupolis (Isaac ( 1986 ) 131 ) or further west, at Makri (Mottas ( 1989 ) 88 , 95 )."
650,Stryme,Thrace from Nestos to Hebros,40.55,25.2,731,4015,"650 . Stryme Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 55 , long. 25 . 20 . Size of territory: probably 3 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Στρυacute µ η , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 108 -9 ; Dem. 50 . 32 ; SEG 39 666 . 27 , ad 202 ). Apart from Steph. Byz. 587 . 17 there is no attestation of a city-ethnic. At Hdt. 7 . 108 . 2 Stryme is called a Thasian polis bordering on Mesambria: . . . Μεσα µ βρία . έχεται δεgrave ταυacuteτης Θασίων πόλις Στρυacute µ η . . . Thus, polis is used in the territorial and political senses combined. For its urban centre, see infra . Some lexicographers seem to agree in calling Stryme an emporion (Harp. Σ 49 , perhaps derived from Philoch. fr. 43 or from Dem. 50 . 20 ; cf. Suda Σ 1231 ). Stryme was situated in the Briantike, a region formerly called Gallaïke and belonging to the Thracian Kikones (Hdt. 7 . 108 -9 ). Stryme was an island off the Thracian coast colonised by Thasos (Harp. Σ 49 , quoting Heraclid. Pont. fr. 125 , Wehrli) and the C3 historian Philostephanos of Kyrene ( FHG iii 28 -34 , omitting this fragment)). Demosthenes stresses its lack of a safe harbour at least for naval units (Dem. 50 . 22 : αλί µ ενον χωρίον ). Describing the march of Xerxes' army through the Aegean Thrace, Herodotos ( 7 . 108 -9 ) presents a confusing account of Stryme's location: west of Mesambrie, the westernmost settlement in the peraia of Samothrake, and separated from it by the river Lissos, but also east of Lake Ismaris, which lay between Maroneia and Stryme. These incoherent pieces of information do not allow any secure identification. It is usually assumed that Stryme was a Thasian coastal outpost bordering on the territory of Maroneia (Lazaridis 1971 a ), and therefore, ever since its foundation in, probably, C7 , a constant bone of contention between these two cities. Vaguely attested is a first contention in C7s (Philoch. fr. 43 , citing Archilochos, fr. 291 , West); a direct conflict in 361 / 60 was solved by Athenian intervention in support of the Thasians (Dem. 12 . 17 , 50 . 20 -22 ) recording the Athenian arbitration (cf. Isaac ( 1986 ) 70 -71 ). Stryme was presumably destroyed c. 350 by the Maronitans, possibly supported by Philip II (Bakalakis ( 1967 ) 145 ). Stryme is inconclusively identified with the ancient fortified settlement excavated on a peninsula north-east of Cape Molyvoti (plan in Lazaridis ( 1972 ) fig. 71 ) with remains dating from C6l to C4f (Bakalakis ( 1967 ); disputed by Isaac ( 1986 ) 12 , 71 -72 ). The present configuration of the peninsula allows the hypothesis that, as recorded by Philostephanos ( supra ), it was indeed an island during at least part of Antiquity (Kranioti ( 1990 ) 629 ; for a tentative demarcation of the extent of Stryme's territory,see Lazaridis ( 1972 b ) 4 . 19 ). Archaeological remains include parts of C5 -C4m fortification walls and cross-walls built in irregular masonry with brick superstructure, subterranean tunnels, cisterns and wells in the southern edge of Cape Molyvoti, which were interpreted as having constituted a major aqueduct, on the analogy of the Eupalinean aqueduct in Samos but on a much smaller scale.Furthermore,there are traces of a small port located south of the city, and a group of five grave monuments with three inhumations and two cremations dated to 450 -425 bordering a roughly paved road, to the north-east of the cross-wall. Imported pottery in the entire excavated area consists exclusively of Attic C5 -C4 ware. The urban centre extended south and east of the citadel, while the cemetery spread over the west flank of the cape, outside the wall. On the evidence of a few excavated C5l-C4m private houses, it is believed to have conformed to the Hippodameian urban system (Bakalakis ( 1967 )); Kranioti ( 1984 )). A cemetery with tumuli containing C5 cist graves and sarcophagi was excavated 4 km north of the walled settlement (Bakalakis ( 1967 ) 3 -18 ; on the recent discovery c. 4 km north to north-east of Molyvoti of four C5s sepulchral tumuli, see Triantaphyllos ( 1992 ) 655 -59 )."
651,Zone (Zonaios),Thrace from Nestos to Hebros,40.5,25.45,718,3817,"651 . Zone (Zonaios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 50 , long. 25 . 45 . Size of territory: probably 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Ζώνη , ηasper (Hecat. fr. 161 ; Hdt. 7 . 59 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 67 ; IG i³ 77 . 5 . 27 -28 : Ζόνε παραgrave Σέρρειον ). The city-ethnic is Ζωναῖος ( F.Delphes iii . 1 497 . 5 ; cf. Robert ( 1940 ) 81 -90 ). Zone is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 7 . 59 . 2 , whereas Ps.-Skylax 68 lists Drys and Zone as two coastal emporia situated opposite Samothrake. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and externally in a Delphic list of C4l-C3e. The individual and external use is attested in a C3 honorific decree from Samothrake. Zone is listed among members of the Delian League in the assessment decree of 422 / 1 , and was assessed at 2 tal. ( IG i³ 77 . 5 . 27 -28 ), an indication that it was the richest if not the largest of the cities of the peraia of Samothrake. Zone was situated on the beach front, between Sale and Serreion (Hdt. 7 . 59 . 2 ), in the vicinity of Drys (Ps.-Skylax 67 ), also located near Serreion. It has been sought at Cape Makri (identified with Serreion), right below the Zonaia Mts. (presumably Choban Dag), and was tentatively identified with a site near the modern village of Makri ( ATL i. 518 ; Bakalakis ( 1961 ) 15 ; Lazaridis ( 1971 c ) 39 ; for an early discussion of proposed unjustified identifications simplifying the admittedly confused settlement pattern transmitted by literary sources for this area, see Robert ( 1940 ) and, more recently, Isaac ( 1986 ) 128 -33 ). However, numerous, otherwise rare coins of Zone have turned up during the systematic excavation of the urban centre near the mouth of the stream Shabla Dere, formerly identified with Mesambria. These finds strongly support the now prevailing view that the site is ancient Zone ( BE ( 1976 ) 464 , ( 1978 ) 312 , ( 1979 ) 282 , ( 1980 ) 319 , ( 1981 ) 326 ; TIR 61 ; Thrace ( 1994 ) 80 ; J. Tsatsopoulou ( 1995 ) 671 -73 ; Galani-Krikou ( 1996 ), contra Soustal ( 1991 ) 354 -55 ; according to Triantaphyllos ( Thrace ( 1994 ) 80 ) Mesambria may have been some older name of Zone).This identification was reinforced by the discovery of an Archaic sanctuary of Apollo (see infra ), the poliad deity of Zone, as evidenced by this city's C4 coinage. The excavated urban centre near Shabla Dere, dating from C6 to the Heltic period, is organised in accordance with the Hippodamic system, with cross-intersecting paved roads, various types of house and an elaborate sewage system. It is protected by two contiguous fortification walls (ashlar and pseudo-isodomic poros masonry, the western wall in Lesbian masonry) measuring 1370 and 960 m respectively and enclosing an area of 50 ha), reinforced with rectangular towers extending from the seaboard to the top of a 108 . 5 m-high acropolis; the southern sea-wall is presumed to have disappeared in the sea (J. Tsatsopoulou ( 1987 ) 472 ), as did the presumed port installations (Vavritsas ( 1988 ) 80 ). The south-west part of the enclosed area, measuring 50 . 50 × 46 . 50 m, was densely built and additionally fortified with an internal wall. Ceramic pipes probably belonging to the city aqueduct were discovered near a mountain spring c. 1 , 500 m to the north-west (Vavritsas ( 1973 ) 122 ). Extensive C5 -C3 cemeteries were identified west of the urban centre (P. Tsatsopoulou ( 1997 )). A decree discovered in the excavations remains unpublished ( BE ( 1976 ) 464 ). The evidence of the coins indicates that the poliad deity of Zone was Apollo (Galani-Krikou ( 1996 ), ( 1997 )). His sanctuary, with a C6 temple, probably in antis or prostyle, has been identified on the hill-top near the eastern fortification wall.Inside the temenos werefound parts of the cult statue of ## II.

652,Alexandropolis,Inland Thrace,,,271,1561,"652 . Alexandropolis Unlocated. Not in Barr . Type: B: β . The topopym is Αλεξανδρόπολις (Plut. Alex . 9 . 1 ); for Αλεξανδρεία at Steph.Byz.,see infra . The polis status can be inferred from the toponym, but see infra . The principal, perhaps, only source for this polis is Plut. Alex . 9 . 1 : Alexander,left in charge of affairs and of minting in Makedonia during Philip's absence on campaign against Byzantion (no. 674 ) in 341 , suppressed an uprising of the Maidoi, captured their polis , ejected its inhabitants, and settled a mixed community in their place, calling this new foundation Alexandropolis. The incident is usually connected with the same campaign that led to a confrontation between Antipater and Parmenio on the Makedonian side, with the 'Tetrachoritai' on the other ( P.Ryl . 1 . 19 = Theopomp.fr. 217 ; cf. Archibald ( 1998 )). The other possible source is Steph. Byz. 70 . 8 : Αλεξάνδρειαι πόλεις οκτωκαίδεκα with 71 . 8 -9 : τρίτη ΘρΩsubiotaάκης προgraveς τηsubiotaηtilde ΜακεδονίΩsubiotaα , 'the one he founded before the big Alexandreia, being seventeen years of age' . Since Stephanos lists all eighteen cities founded by Alexander under the heading Αλεξάνδρειαι , the presumption is that the third one, that in Thrace, is identical with Plutarch's Alexandropolis and that its name was in fact Alexandropolis, as reported by Plutarch. However, the story that Alexander founded a polis at the age of 16 or 17 may be just another anecdote about Alexander,of which there are so many in late sources (cf. Fraser ( 1996 ) 26 and 29 -30 )."

Apros is one of the names that appears on a silver bowl from Rogozen ( SEG 37 618 ; cf. Archibald ( 1998 ) 121 , 225 , 234 ). In Steph. Byz. Apros is classified as a πόλις Θράκης ( 107 . 5 ). Stephanos quotes Theopompos: τουtilde δ ' Αντιπάτρου διατρίβοντος περιgrave τη ` ν Αacuteπρον . It is clear from the quote that the classification of Apros as a polis does not stem from Theopompos.Thus the only thing we know about C4 Apros is that Antipatros was operating from Apros, probably against some native Thracians."
654,Kabyle (Kabylenos),Inland Thrace,42.3,26.3,949,5301,"654 . Kabyle (Kabylenos) Map 22 . Lat. 42 . 30 , long. 26 . 30 . Size of territory: ? Type: C: γ . The toponym is Καβυacuteλη , ηasper (Dem. 8 . 44 , 10 . 15 ; Harp. Κ 1 ; Steph. Byz. 346 . 1 , quoting Polyb. 13 . 10 . 10 ). Variant forms are attested in late sources: Καλυacuteβη (Plin. HN 4 . 41 ; Steph. Byz. 350 . 4 ; Ptol. 2 . 11 . 7 ) and, perhaps, Βαβυacuteλη (Steph. Byz. 154 . 8 ). The city-ethnic is Καβυληνός (C2 coins: Head, HN ² 278 ). Kabyle is called a polis in late sources only (Strabo 7 . 6 . 2 ; Steph. Byz. 350 . 4 ) and is described as a chorion by Harpokration, quoting Theopompos (fr. 220 ) and Anaximenes ( FGrHist 72 fr. 12 ). At Suda (K 9 ) it is referred to as a χώρα τηtildeς ΘρΩsubiotaάκης . Kabyle was apparently a military colony founded or perhaps refounded by Philip II (Dem. 8 . 44 ; Strabo 7 . 6 . 2 ; Steph. Byz. 350 . 4 ) c. 340 (Theopomp.fr. 220 ). Ancient Kabyle was situated on a plateau overlooking a bend in the river Tonzos (modern Tundja), 7 km north of the modern city of Yambol (Velkov ( 1982 a )). Excavated inscriptions have confirmed its location (Velkov ( 1991 a )). In Antiquity,the river-bed of the Tonzos (modern Tundja,now occupied by a tributary of the Tonzos, the Azmak), lay some 3 or 4 km nearer Kabyle, and thus washed around its southeastern periphery.The excavators assume that docking facilities would have existed close by. The nucleus of the ancient settlement was the acropolis of Zai ˘ ci vruh, where an Iron Age cult centre was located, associated in Heltic times with Artemis Phosphoros and Herakles (Velkov ( 1983 ) 237 -38 ). Traces of occupation in the early Iron Age have been discovered on the lower hill to the south-east,called Hisarlik (Archibald ( 1998 ) 45 with further refs.). Excavations along the lower slopes of Zai ˘ ci vruh, where the C4 western gateway and contemporary parts of the adjacent circuit wall were discovered (Domaradzki ( 1991 )), have shown that the earliest occupation layer in this area dates from the same period, on the basis of imported amphora stamps of C4s (Domaradzki ( 1991 ) 59 ; Getov ( 1995 ) 99 -101 ). Deep trenches in the Roman city have revealed evidence of earlier deposits. None of this material has yet been published, although brief reports have appeared in the annual bulletin of excavations of the Institute of Archaeology, Sofia ( Archeologicheski Otkritya i Razkopki = AOR ). Between 1986 and 1990 , Getov excavated the road leading into the city from the western gate. Domaradzki revealed a road surface paved with river stones and fired clay sherds at the level of the early Makedonian gateway, and a similar road surface made of pebbles close to tower no. 2 . Stone foundations belonging to various structures of the late Iron Age (second half of the first millennium bc ) were discovered near the same tower and below the floor of the Roman horreum . The foundations of an oval(?) hut were found near the western gate, together with stone footings and clay floors belonging to residential units whose design cannot as yet be determined. The most important evidence dating to the first 100 years after Philip II's foundation comes from burials in tumuli outside the city (Getov ( 1991 )). These suggest that local élite families continued to dominate civic affairs; the names of moneyers and such information as can be gleaned from epigraphic and written sources tend to confirm this impression (Draganov ( 1993 ); cf. Dimitrov in Dimitrov and Penchev ( 1984 ) concerning Seuthopolis; Archibald ( 1998 ) 311 , 315 -16 ). On the basis of numismatic,archaeological and epigraphic data, scholars have postulated a formative phase of the city while a Makedonian garrison was resident, c. 340 -280 , followed by a period dominated by one or more local rulers, from c. 280 , with a marked diminution of activity from C2 onwards, precipitated perhaps by the aggressive campaigns of Philip V. The spatial characteristics of the city in pre-Imperial times are uncertain. The agora and sanctuary (Phosphorion) of Artemis, mentioned in the Seuthopolis inscription, have not yet been located. The acropolis shrine was put out of use by a tower, associated by Velkov with the introduction of the Makedonian garrison, but activities at the shrine resumed, perhaps later in C3 . Unpublished evidence from Hisarlik of extensive trading contacts in C5 -C4suggests that there may have been a permanent settlement there before the advent of Philip II; but how this changed in response to the Makedonian garrison, and the creation of a fortified enclosure, is still unknown. Kabyle minted coins on behalf of two local leaders, Spartokos and Skostokos, and later for the Celtic chieftain Cavarus. An autonomous bronze coinage began some time in the second quarter of C3 , showing the city's patron goddess, Artemis Phosphoros, and the legend ΚΑΒ (Draganov ( 1993 ), ( 1998 )). In C3 coins of Kabyle circulated in an area extending westwards along the upper Tundja valley north of Nova Zagora, and southwards some 40 km downstream (Draganov ( 1998 ) map 1 ). The issues of Spartokos and Skostokos suggest that whatever power they had was of limited scope and duration, and that they acted as lieutenants, or officials, rather than rulers (Draganov ( 1984 ), ( 1985 ); Archibald ( 1998 ) 311 -12 )."
655,Philippopolis (Philippopolites),Inland Thrace,42.1,24.45,918,5175,"655 . Philippopolis (Philippopolites) Map 22 . Lat. 42 . 10 , long. 24 . 45 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: γ . The toponym is Φιλιππόπολις , ηasper (Steph. Byz. 666 . 9 ; Plin. HN 4 . 41 ; Dexippus (( FGrHist 100 ) fr. 27 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is Φιλιπποπολίτης (Steph.Byz. 666 . 10 , perhaps just a conjecture). Philippopolis is called a polis in late sources only (Steph. Byz.; Dexippus) but probably by Theopompos too, since the late tradition about the nickname Πονηρόπολις seems to be a direct quotation of his work (Plut. Mor . 520 B; Plin. HN 4 . 41 ; Suda ∆ 1423 = Theopomp.fr. 110 , see infra ). Philippopolis (Plovdiv) is usually considered to have been one of the cities founded by Philip II when he was consolidating his power in Thrace after the defeat of Kersebleptes,the last independent ruler of the region (Diod. 16 . 71 . 2 ). Diodorus does not name any of the cities, but Pliny says 'oppidum sub Rhodope Poneropolis antea, mox a conditore Philippopolis, nunc a situ Trimontium dicta' ( HN 4 . 11 . 41 ), without specifying which king was being referred to. But Dexippus specifies that Philip is the son of Amyntas, which rules out Philip V (whom Domaradzki ( 1993 ) 36 preferred, judging by the absence of any clear military architecture before the late Heltic period). The epithet 'Poneropolis'derives from Theopompos (fr. 110 , see supra ), and is consistent with the sort of moralistic, disparaging phrases the historian used liberally of Philip II (e.g.fr. 162 ; cf. Flower ( 1994 ) 119 -30 ). Pliny takes the disparaging name too literally, assuming it to have been an earlier epithet of Philippopolis. The historical origins of Philippopolis lie in the sanctuary that occupied part or all of the summit of Nebet tepe,which, together with Djambaz tepe and Taksim tepe, constituted 'Trimontium'under the Roman Empire.The earliest traces of cult activity date to the early Bronze Age (Tsonchev ( 1938 ); Peykov ( 1990 ), ( 1994 ), ( 1995 )). Some controversy has attached to the Iron Age remains that succeeded these (see Domaradzki ( 1998 ) 22 -29 ; Popov ( 2000 ) 125 -26 ). But recent excavations have shown that the cult centre here was far larger and more ambitious in C4l and C3e than had previously been thought (Koleva ( 1997 ); Koleva et al . ( 2000 ) 103 -8 ). These discoveries have dispelled any doubts that may have existed about the religious nature of activities on the summit.Six locations have been investigated in detail on the summit of Nebet tepe, and one below it, on the eastern side of the ancient city. A concentric circular stone foundation (St. Matanov trench) marks a substantial structure belonging to the late Bronze or beginning of the Iron Age (i.e. in absolute dates, end of second and early first millennium).Cult deposits in the area of the temple continued until C6 or C5 . Approximately 300 m away, on the same terrace, three strata were identified belonging to the period between C5 and C3 . In the latest stratum was the foundation of a rectangular structure, oriented north-south, whose hard-beaten floor contained a decorated hearth altar and a trapezoidal platform, the former resembling well-known types from Seuthopolis, Vetren and elsewhere in Thrace (Koleva et al . ( 2000 ) 104 fig. 1 for plan; fig. 3 , hearth altar). Elsewhere rock carvings bring this sanctuary into line with upland cult sites in the Sakar and Strandja mountains and at Kabyle (Zai˘ ci vruh). Twenty-six pits associated with cult activity and three hearth altars were discovered on Kamchya Street, at the north-eastern foot of Nebet tepe. This area seems to be linked with activities on the summit not just in terms of chronology (C6 onwards) and function, but also in the design of specific structures. Some of the pits were superseded by a roofed construction, resembling the form of a building that succeeded the circular 'temple'on the summit. There is now growing agreement among scholars that D. Tsonchev was right to postulate a fortified enclosure on the summit of Nebet tepe before the Makedonian conquest (Tsonchev ( 1938 ); Botusharova ( 1963 ); Domaradzki ( 1998 ) 28 ; Koleva et al . ( 2000 ) 110 -11 ; Popov ( 2000 ) 129 ). Traces of a wall made of river stones have been dated before C6 (Domaradzki ( 1998 ) 28 , with discussion). The earliest section of masonry in the city's fortifications has been dated to between C3 and C2 , and may be connected with the campaigns of Philip V rather than Philip II (Botusharova ( 1963 )). The nucleus of Iron Age activity at Plovdiv expanded from the summit of Nebet tepe to its surrounding plain. This expansion was already in progress in C6 -C5 . A little further from Nebet tepe,to the south-east,a cultural deposit of C4 -C3 ( 4 m below the modern street) has revealed domestic structures and abundant movable finds (ceramics, including imported fine wares,numerous loom weights and coins of Maroneia, Philip II and Alexander III). In the vicinity are burial mounds and flat cremation burials dating from C3 to C2 (Bospachieva ( 1995 ), ( 1997 ), ( 2000 ); cf. tumulus with built tomb near Filipovo (Botusharova and Kolarova ( 1961 ); Archibald ( 1998 ) 283 , 296 -98 , 338 ))."
656,Pistiros (Pistirenos),Inland Thrace,,,1369,7607,"656 . Pistiros (Pistirenos) Not in Barr ., cf. infra . Size of territory: ? Type: C: β . The toponym is Πίστιρος ( BCH 123 ( 1999 ) 248 -49 , hereafter BCH , see infra ; Steph. Byz. 171 . 6 , 524 . 11 ; Etym . Magn . 488 . 10 = Hdn. iii . 2 449 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is Πιστιρηνός ( BCH 16 ), Steph. Byz. 524 . 11 erroneously conjectures Πιστιρίτης . Pistiros is classified as a polis by Etym . Magn . 488 . 10 , as an emporion by Steph. Byz. 524 . 11 : ε µ πόριον ΘρΩsubiotaάκης ). The collective and external use of the city-ethnic is attested at BCH 16 . Notwithstanding the alternative proposals put forward by Salviat ( 1999 ) and Bravo and Chankowski ( 1999 ) in favour of Herodotos' Pistyros on the Aegean coast ( 7 . 109 . 2 ) as the location of the epigraphically attested Pistiros, most scholars have accepted the arguments put forward by the editors,Velkov and Domaradzka,reinforced by the archaeological evidence adduced by M. Domaradzki, that the site of Adjiyska Vodenitsa corresponds wholly or partly to the place and community referred to in the decree (Velkov and Domaradzka ( 1994 ), ( 1995 ), ( 1996 ); Domaradzka ( 1996 ), ( 2002 a ); Domaradzki ( 1993 ), ( 1995 ), ( 1996 ), ( 1998 ), ( 2000 a ), ( 2000 c ), ( 2002 ); Lazova ( 1996 ); Bo˘ snakov ( 1999 ); Hansen ( 1997 a ) 88 , 90 -91 ; Loukopoulou ( 1999 ); Archibald ( 1998 ) 224 , 226 -28 , ( 2002 a and b )). The main source for Pistiros is the recently found C4 inscription ( BCH , discussed supra 887 -90 ). It is a renewal of the privileges bestowed by the late Kotys on a community of Greeks in Pistiros. As a group the Greeks are called ε µ πορῖται , a rare word presumably used synonymously with έ µ ποροι , but not quite: έ µ ποροι are traders who travel from place to place. The ε µ πορῖται seem to be the inhabitants of the emporion , only some of whom were emporoi (ll. 10 -11 ). Pistiros is not explicitly called an ε µ πόριον , but from the term emporitai and the reference to other emporia in the neighbourhood (ll. 22 -24 ) it seems safe to infer that the place was an emporion , an inference supported by Stephanos' note: Πίστιρος , ε µ πόριον ΘρΩsubiotaάκης ( 524 . 11 ). In constitutional terms, Pistiros appears to be a polis , not just an urban centre, but it also enjoyed some degree of autonomy,which was asserted,as well as constrained,by the unnamed ruler in relation to other named and unnamed groups.It is worth noting that the terminology of the decree might be distinguishing between oi Pistirenoi (l. 16 ) and 'Apollonians and Thasians who are in Pistiros' (ll. 32 -33 ; Maronitans, l. 28 , also understood?). But the reference to Pistirenians comes from the main body of the decree, while the latter distinction is contained in the citation attributed to Kotys (I). To understand the status of Pistiros, one must start with the toponym Πίστιρος (ll. 12 , 22 -24 , 33 ) and the ethnic Πιστιρηνῶ µ (l. 16 ). Pistiros is a rare name,and it seems reasonable to assume that there must have been some connection between the polis Pistiros on the coast and the homonymous inland emporion , and that the Pistirenians living in the emporion were citizens of the polis , just as others among the inhabitants were citizens of Apollonia, Maroneia and Thasos (Hansen ( 2004 ); Velkov and Domaradzka ( 1994 ) 7 ; Loukopoulou ( 1999 ) 368 assumes a transfer of the settlement, i.e. a metoikesis ). It is nowhere stated that the citizens of Apollonia, Maroneia and Thasos were among the emporitai = the Pistirinians. The Maronitai, Apolloniatai and Thasioi may well have been emporoi , i.e. travelling merchants or merchants living for a shorter or longer period in Pistiros without becoming citizens of the community. One possible scenario is as follows (Hansen ( 2004 )). The emporion of Pistiros was an inland trading station, originally founded by merchants coming from the polis of Pistiros, a dependency of Thasos situated on the Thracian coast (Hdt. 7 . 109 . 2 ). The core of the settlers ( τῶν οικητόρων in l. 38 ) were from the outset citizens of the polis Pistiros (cf. Πιστιρηνῶ µ at l. 16 ), but some of the other inhabitants were citizens of Maroneia, Apollonia and Thasos (ll. 27 -33 ), and in C4 they may have formed the most important element of the population. It is apparent from the inscription that it was only one out of a number of emporia in inland Thrace involved principally in trade with Maroneia (ll. 21 -24 ). The emporion was surrounded by native Thracians ( τοῖς Θραιξίν in ll. 8 -9 ). The mixture of four different ethnics suggests that Pistiros was not an ordinary polis in its own right. But we cannot exclude the possibility that Pistiros was a kind of dependent polis whose citizens are described as Πιστιρηνοί , and that the Μαρωνῖται , the Θάσιοι and the Απολλωνιηtildeται lived in Pistiros as metics. At present the origins of the emporion are uncertain. The site at Adjiyska Vodenitsa was occupied some time in C5 (Bouzek ( 2002 a ) discusses the evidence prior to C5s). Excavations have yet to reveal the character of the earliest settlement. During C5s, the area was (re)organised in a formal manner, based on a street system integrated with the fortification walls and the eastern gateway, through which the main east-west road runs (Domaradzki ( 1993 ), ( 1995 ), ( 1996 ), ( 2002 )). This east-west road has at least three major surfaces,which mirror the key events that affected life on the site in its three phases. The initial plan consisted of an ambitious double-faced masonry wall enclosing a grid plan of streets, paved with ashlar slabs, similar to the wall itself and the main drain. Some time in C4f, perhaps in the 370 s, the eastern gateway was modified substantially, with the reconstruction of the exterior tower. This reconstruction heralds a phase of spectacular internal development, both architectural and commercial. Multi-roomed structures, on stone footings, roofed with imported and locally made tiles, can certainly be traced back to this period. The largest number of bulk imports, including storage amphoras from Chios, Thasos and elsewhere in the Aegean, together with Attic figured and black-glazed pottery, belong to this period. C. 300 , the eastern gateway perished in a fierce blaze and was never rebuilt in the same form. The successor gateway was far more modest and lacked many of the specific defensive features of its predecessor. The road was relaid with cobbles made of river stones, not dressed slabs (Domaradzki ( 1993 ), ( 1995 ), ( 1996 ), ( 2002 )). There followed a lengthy period of redevelopment,involving the reuse of older materials.Some areas seem to have changed their function (Domaradzki ( 1999 ); Archibald et al . ( 2002 )). The interpretation of this phase is still in progress. One of the most remarkable aspects of the finds at Vetren is the large number of coins discovered during the excavations. The total number currently stands at c. 1 , 800 items. A pot hoard of 552 Makedonian coins, datable to the 280 s, was found by the Czech team in a building adjacent to the east-west road. The coins range from rare regal issues of Amadokos I, Kotys I, Amadokos II and other Thracian rulers, to imitation Thasian denominations, silver from Parion, the Chersonese, Mesembria and Apollonia on the Black Sea, as well as other Aegean civic coins. Other items of commercial significance include weights and measures, and graffiti. Domestic items include loom weights, spindle whorls, gaming tokens, metallic pins, needles, ornaments and other equipment, together with tools for domestic and industrial (metallurgical) use."
657,Seuthopolis,Inland Thrace,42.4,25.2,525,2910,"657 . Seuthopolis Map 22 . Lat. 42 . 40 , long. 25 . 20 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: γ . The toponym is Σευθόπολις ( SEG 42 661 . 31 (C3e)). The polis status of Seuthopolis can be deduced from its toponym. The name of the city indicates that it was either founded or refounded in C4l by Seuthes III, a Thracian prince who in the years c. 325 -315 asserted his independence of Makedonia (Bengtson ( 1962 ) 19 -20 ). Seuthopolis is usually taken to be the residence of Seuthes III (Archibald ( 1998 ) 313 ). The city of Seuthes III was unknown until its chance discovery and excavation in advance of the construction of the Georgi Dimitrov Dam in the upper course of the river Tundja.The only known reference to Seuthopolis in written sources is in the inscription found in a room of the 'palace' during its excavation. The publication formula (ll. 27 -34 ) prescribes that one copy of the text be deposited in Seuthopolis (l. 31 ) in the sanctuary of the Great Gods, and a second copy in the hieron of Dionysos, in the agora ( IGBulg. iii . 2 ( 1964 ) 146 -49 no. 1731 ; Velkov ( 1991 a ) 7 -11 ; SEG 42 661 ( ed. pr. ), 46 877 *, 48 995 ). The plan of the excavated city ( 8 km west of modern Kazanluk) covered a mere 5 ha and was situated on a ridge above the river Chiflikchiyska, a tributary of the Tonzos (Tundja),which protected the city on its eastern flank.From the other three sides it was enclosed by a circuit wall of brick on a foundation of two stone courses, the lowest of which forms a slight bench extending away from the outer face. Squarish towers protected the corners of a pentangular area, divided into insulae by a cruciform pattern of streets, north-south and east-west, with narrower cross-streets. The insulae were divided into residential property units, comprising house designs of pastas and prostas types. One room usually contained a decorated hearth altar.The northwestern corner of the city plan was separated from the city by an additional fortification wall, also with towers at each corner, and entered through a gateway without special elaboration. The inscription refers to the agora, a sanctuary of Dionysos and a shrine of the Samothrakian gods. The latter shrine was identified with the complex of rooms in the 'acropolis' area. The agora was situated north of the east-west road, but remains in the area were not sufficiently well preserved to allow any clear identification of the sanctuary of Dionysos. The circulation of Seuthes III's coins in a relatively homogeneous area suggests the possible scope of his political power. This area included the Valley of the Roses, the Thracian plain between the valley of the river Tundja on the east, including Kabyle,and the river Sazliyka in the west,east of Plovdiv, extending down the Hebros valley towards Haskovo and Svilengrad (Domaradzki ( 1987 ) 7 and map 2 = Archibald ( 1998 ) 312 fig. 13 . 1 ). ## II.

The toponym is Αιγοgraveς ποτα µ οί , οιasper (Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 24 ; Marm . Par . A 57 (r 468 / 7 )), named after the nearby river: Αιγοgraveς ποτα µ ός (Ps.-Skylax 67 ; IG v . 1 239 . 5 (C4e)). The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested in abbreviated form on some C4s coins: ΑΙΓΟΣ ΠΟ ( infra ). Aigos potamoi was situated on the Hellespontine coast of the Chersonesos, not far from Sestos (no. 672 ), and presumably near the river Aigos potamos (Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 20 -29 ; cf. schol. Ael. Arist. 164 . 17 ). Hauvette-Besnault ( 1880 ) 517 -18 found no remains along the river. The actual distance between Sestos and the river Aigos potamos is c. 105 stadia; but the distance between Sestos and Aigos potamoi was 15 stadia according to Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 25 and 280 according to Strabo 7 fr. 55 . Both must be wrong,but Xenophon's account of the situation leading up to the battle in 405 shows beyond doubt that Sestos must have been within walking distance of Aigos potamoi; see also πλησίον Σηστουtilde at schol. Ael. Arist. 1 . 167 . It seems, pace Barr ., that Aigos potamoi must be located somewhere south of the river. It is apparent from Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 25 and 28 that Aigos potamoi was not a polis in 405 , but the silver coins of, probably, C5 , and the bronze coins issued in C4s ( infra ) indicate that Aigos potamoi probably had had polis status at some point in C5 , and probably acquired polis status again some time c. 350 : it is not among the poleis on the Chersonesos listed at Ps.-Skylax 67 , a chapter that includes Datos (no. 629 ) and thus must be dated to C4m or a little later. Aigos potamoi is called a deserted polichne by Strabo ( 7 fr. 55 ) and a polis by Steph. Byz. Aigos potamoi struck coins in C5 -C4 .

659,Alopekonnesos (Alopekonnesios),Thracian Chersonesos,40.2,26.15,865,4410,"659 . Alopekonnesos (Alopekonnesios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 20 , long. 26 . 15 . Size of territory: 2 or 3 . Type: [A]: α . The toponym is Αλωπεκόννησος , ηasper (Dem. 23 . 166 ; Ps.-Skylax 67 ). The city-ethnic is Αλωπεκοννήσιος ( IG ii² 1443 . 97 ( 344 / 3 )) or, once, Αλωποκοννήσιος ( IG i³ 282 . i . 21 ). Alopekonnesos is not explicitly called a polis in any Archaic or Classical source, but in Ps.-Skylax 67 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Αλωπεκόννησος is the fourth of eleven toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε . The political sense is attested in IG i³ 282 . i . 15 and 21 , where the Alepokonnesians are listed under the heading αιasperacuteδε πόλεις . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on C4 coins ( infra ) and externally in literature (Ephor. fr. 39 ) and in inscriptions ( IG i³ 277 . v . 8 ). The individual use is attested both externally ( IG xii . 8 95 (C2 ), Imbros; IG xii . 8 190 . 10 -11 (C1 ), Samothrake; cf. Robert ( 1948 ) 37 (C1 )) and internally in funerary inscriptions of Roman date, discovered at neighbouring sites in the Chersonesos, also with variant forms such as Αλαποκονήσιος (cf. Robert ( 1948 ) 37 -39 ). Alopekonnesos was situated between Limnai (no. 668 ) and Elaious (no. 663 ) (Ps.-Skymnos 705 -7 ), at the southern end of the Gulf of Melas, directly north of Cape Mazousia and Elaious (Strabo 7 fr. 51 ). In Ps.-Skylax 67 it is listed between the unlocated settlements of Paion (no. 670 ) and Araplos (no. 660 ). It lay on a headland running out towards Imbros, a place swarming with robbers and pirates in C4m (Dem. 23 . 166 -68 ). The presumed location of Alopekonnesos on the promontory of Küçuk Kemikli, at the north end of Suvla Bay, following Strabo's description, is archaeologically and epigraphically confirmed (Hauvette-Besnault ( 1880 ) 518 -20 ; Picard and Reinach ( 1912 ) 277 ; Hutton ( 1914 -16 ); cf. Robert ( 1948 ) 37 -39 ; Isaac ( 1986 ) 189 -91 ). Alopekonnesos was founded by Aiolians, and the Alopekonnesians were the first to colonise Ainos (no. 641 ) (Ephor. fr. 39 ; cf. Strabo 7 fr. 52 ). The foundation of Alopekonnesos is presumed to antedate the C6 Athenian colonisation of the Chersonesos. It was probably integrated into the Chersonesitan state set up by Miltiades, but after the flight of Miltiades and the Persian occupation, it regained its independence and became a member of the Athenian League. Thus, it is the first city of the Chersonesos to appear independently as a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . iii . 29 , mostly restored) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . i . 21 and iii . 55 , almost entirely restored) a total of fifteen times, three times completely restored, paying 3 , 240 dr. in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . v . 14 ), 1 , 000 dr. from 442 / 1 onwards ( IG i³ 270 . ii . 14 , a reduction usually attributed to the establishment of Athenian klerouchs; cf. Kahrstedt ( 1954 ) 16 ; Isaac ( 1986 ) 179 -80 , 190 ), and later, from 435 / 4 , 2 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 277 . v . 8 ). In 429 / 28 Alopekonnesos is listed (with Sestos (no. 672 )) among poleis of the Hellespontine district that καταδηλ ˜ οσι τοgraveν φόρον (present a voucher for tribute) ( IG i³ 282 . i . 15 -16 and 21 ), presumably contributing to the maintenance of the hellespontophylakes and serving as bases for the fleet patrolling the Hellespontine waters ( ATL i. 449 -50 ; cf. Thuc. 2 . 24 . 1 ). During the lengthy conflict between Athens and the Odrysians for control of the Chersonesos in the second-quarter of C4 , Alopekonnesos, which had become a pirates' nest, was besieged by the Athenians in 360 / 59 (Dem. 23 . 166 -68 ), and seems to have become part of the Atheno-Thracian condominium, ratified by the short-lived treaty of 357 ( IG ii² 126 ; cf. Kahrstedt ( 1954 ) 27 ; contested by Veligianni ( 1995 ) 161 -68 ). Ten years later Alopekonnesos joined the demos of Chersonesos (no. 661 ) and of Madytos (no. 669 ) in awarding Athens a golden crown ( IG ii² 1443 . 95 -97 ( 347 / 6 )). Alopekonnesos struck bronze coins from c. 400 to c. 200 : obv . usually Dionysos, or head of maenad, rarely Apollo or Athena; rev . fox, or kantharos, or bunch of grapes; on later coins, ear of wheat. Legend: ΑΛΩ or ΑΛΩΠΕΚΟΝ (Head, HN ² 258 ; SNG.Cop.Thrace 856 -61 ; Y arkin ( 1978 ))."

Tentatively identified with Drabos (Kahrstedt ( 1954 ) 31 and n. 47 ). But Drabos (Strabo 7 fr. 51 ) is east of Alopekonnesos, while Ps.-Skylax locates Araplos south-west of that town (Isaac ( 1986 ) 188 ). Thus, the two sites should be distinguished as they are in Barr ."
661,Chersonesos/Agora (Chersonesites ap' Agoras),Thracian Chersonesos,40.3,26.45,1011,5162,"661 . Chersonesos/Agora (Chersonesites ap' Agoras) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 30 , long. 26 . 45 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: A: α . The toponym is either Χερρόνησος (Hecat. fr. 163 ) or, usually, Αγορά (Hdt. 7 . 58 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 67 ; Dem. 7 . 39 with schol. (no. 43 , Dilts); Steph. Byz. 20 . 9 ). The city-ethnic is Χερρονήσιοι (Hecat. fr. 163 ) or Χερρονεσῖται ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 28 , 268 . ii . 7 ). In literary sources, it is in most cases impossible to distinguish whether Χερσονησίτης is a cityethnic designating the polis of Agora (no unquestionable example) or a regional ethnic designating all the inhabitants of the peninsula (cf. e.g. Hdt. 6 . 39 : οιasper Χερσονησῖται . . . αποgrave πασέων τῶν πολίων ). Agora is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 67 and in the territorial sense by Hdt. 7 . 58 . 2 (see Hansen ( 1996 ) 37 ). The political sense is implicitly attested in the Athenian tribute lists, where the Chersonesitai ap'Agoras are once recorded under the heading πόλες h αίδε ( IG i³ 282 .B i . 11 -14 ). That it was a polis in the political sense as well is indicated by its membership of the Delian League ( infra ). The collective and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in the Athenian tribute lists ( supra ). The individual and external use of the city-ethnic Χερσονησίτης is attested in Attic funerary inscriptions ( IG i³ 1301 (C5m); IG ii² 10505 (C4m)), but in both cases it is impossible to decide whether the reference is to the Taurian or the Thracian Chersonesos. Chersonesos/Agora was situated between Paktye (no. 671 ) and Kardia (no. 665 ) (Ps.-Skylax 67 ) in the middle of the isthmus of the Chersonesos peninsula, presumably on the line of the fortification wall constructed for defensive reasons by Miltiades (Hdt. 6 . 36 . 2 ). It is usually identified with Heltic Lysimacheia (Strabo 7 frr. 51 and 53 ), and is tentatively located at Bulair ( ATL i. 564 -65 ). Chersonesos/Agora was presumably settled with Athenian colonists by Miltiades the Elder, honoured by law ( ωasperς νό µ ος ) as oikistes with sacrifices and athletic games (Hdt. 6 . 38 . 1 ; see Isaac ( 1986 ) 166 -67 ). It is believed to have been his capital ( ATL i. 563 ), with the appellation Agora reflecting the function of the settlement as a market-placeindeed, the major trading centre with the Thracian tribes of the adjacent hinterland-situated on the limes of the Chersonesitan state, i.e. along the Long Wall constructed across the neck of the peninsula of the Chersonesos (Kahrstedt ( 1954 ) 7 ; in n. 10 he interprets Αγοραῖον τεῖχος in Steph. Byz. 20 . 10 as signifying 'Agora by the Wall of Miltiades'). Undoubtedly Chersonesos/Agora received fresh colonists both in C5m, under Perikles, and in C4f, under Derkylidas (Xen. Hell. 4 . 8 . 5 ( 398 )), Chares (Diod. 16 . 34 . 3 -4 ( 353 / 2 )) and Diopeithes (Dem. 8 hypoth . ( 343 / 2 )). In 347 / 6 a golden crown was awarded to Athens by the demos in Chersonesos ( IG ii² 1493 . 97 , partly restored). If Chersonesos/Agora was indeed the centre of Miltiades' Chersonesitan state, we should assume that it housed the prytaneion mentioned by Hdt. 6 . 38 . 2 . It is generally believed that the entry Χερρονεσῖται in the Athenian tribute lists refers to the polis Chersonesos/Agora, presumably representing the remains of the old Chersonesitan state. The Chersonesitai belonged to the Hellespontine district and are recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 28 ) to 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 27 ) a total of seventeen times, twice completely restored. They are first recorded as Χερσονεσῖται ( IG i³ 268 . ii . 7 ) but from, probably, 441 / 0 ( IG i³ 271 . i . 34 -35 ) mostly as Χερρονεσῖται απ ' Αγοραtildeς ( IG i³ 277 . v . 9 -10 ). Chersonesos was regularly assessed at 18 tal. from 454 / 3 to 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . ii . 31 ), but 13 tal, 4 , 840 dr. in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . v . 12 ). Their contribution appears drastically reduced to 1 tal. ( IG i³ 270 . ii . 13 ), perhaps after 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 91 , amount not preserved) following the establishment of 1 , 000 Athenian colonists under Perikles ( ATL i. 563 -64 ; Kahrstedt ( 1954 ) 15 ). Chersonesos was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 73 -74 ). Apart from the coins struck in C6 -C5 when Chersonesos/Agora was the capital of Miltiades'state ( supra 901 ), the Chersonesitai struck coins (silver and bronze) from c. 350 onwards (Kraay ( 1976 ) 158 ; SNG Cop. Suppl . 99 ). ( 1 ) Half-sigloi in silver: obv . bounding lion with head reverted; rev . a variety of types in quadripartite incuse square (olive leaf, dolphin, lizard, etc.). ( 2 ) Small denominations in bronze: obv . lion's head, or head of Athena; rev . barley-corn; legend: ΧΕΡ or ΧΕΡΡΟ (Head, HN ² 257 ; SNG. Cop. Thrace 824 -49 , Suppl . 99 ). These coins are often taken to be federal (Head, HN ² 258 ; Kahrstedt ( 1954 ) 40 ; see supra 902 ), but they are apparently contemporary with the silver halfsigloi and with the C4s coins of Elaious (no. 663 ), Krithote (no. 667 ) and Madytos (no. 669 ), and are better interpreted as a polis coinage struck by Agora/Chersonesos (M.H.Hansen per litteras )."

The toponym is ' Ελαιουtildeς , οasper (Hdt. 7 . 22 ; Thuc. 8 . 102 . 2 ) or, later, ' Ελεουtildeς (Diod. 13 . 49 . 5 ; Strabo 7 fr. 51 ; Paus. 1 . 34 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ελαιουacuteσιος ( IG ii² 228 . 9 ( 341 / 0 )). Elaious is not explicitly called a polis in any Archaic or Classical source, but in Ps.Skylax 67 , where polis is used in the urban sense, ' Ελαιουtildeς is the sixth of eleven toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε . The political sense is attested in IG ii² 43 . 78 and B 27 , where the Elaiousians under the heading πόλεις are listed as members of the Second Athenian Naval League. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C4s coins ( infra ) and externally in both literary sources (Hdt. 9 . 120 . 4 ; Thuc. 8 . 107 . 2 ) and inscriptions ( IG i³ 285 . ii . 81 -82 ( 421 / 20 ); IG ii² 228 = Tod 174 ( 340 )). The individual and external form is found in a C4 honorary decree passed by the klerouchs in Samos (no. 865 ) ( SEG 1 349 (C4 ), Samos; IG xii . 6 253 . 12 ( c. 350 )). A city of the Thracian Chersonesos, Elaious is listed between Araplos (no. 660 ) and Madytos (no. 669 ) by Ps.Skylax 67 , between Alopekonnesos (no. 659 ) and Sestos (no. 672 ) by Ps.-Skymnos 707 -8 . According to Strabo ( 7 frr. 51 and 55 ), its precise location was on a bay directly east of Cape Mazousia at the southernmost tip of the Chersonesos, at a distance of 40 stadia from the city of Sigeion (no. 791 ). Strabo gives the distance from Kardia (no. 665 ) as just over 400 stadia, and from Sestos as 170 stadia. Thanks to archaeological and epigraphic finds, Elaious has been securely identified with the modern village of Eski Hissarlik at the eastern end of Morto Bay. The archaeological evidence points to the presence of Greek colonists in C7l (Isaac ( 1986 ) 193 ). In C6m Elaious was colonised by Athenians under Φορβοων (Ps.-Skymnos 707 -8 ), in ATL i. 289 n. 75 emended to Φρυacuteνων (Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 68 ). According to Bengtson ( 1939 ) 19 -20 , it is a legend fabricated to serve Athenian propaganda, but Elaious was undoubtedly in Athenian hands in C5e (Hdt. 6 . 140 . 1 ). Elaious was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 100 ) to 421 / 0 ( IG i³ 285 . ii . 81 -82 ) a total of fourteen times, four times completely restored, paying a phoros of 3 , 000 dr. in all years ( IG i³ 265 . i . 100 ). In 430 / 29 and 429 / 8 the Elaiousians are listed among cities of the Hellespontine district who paid part of their tribute in the form of misthos ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 47 , 282 B. i . 9 ), presumably contributing to the maintenance of the hellespontophylakes ( ATL i. 449 -50 ; cf. Thuc. 2 . 24 . 1 ). Elaious was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 78 -79 ). It is the only city of the Chersonesos to have joined the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 .B 27 ). It remained loyal to Athens even under pressure from Kotys and despite the siege by Charidemos in 360 (Dem. 23 . 158 ); cf. the golden crown awarded in 347 / 6 to the Athenians by the Elaiousian demos ( IG ii² 1443 . 93 -95 ); its loyalty was recognised and recompensed by the Athenians: in 341 the privileges of the 'Chersonesitans' were extended to the Elaiousians, who obtained equal property rights with the Athenian klerouchs settled in the Chersonesos, probably in 353 under Chares and in 343 under Diopeithes.On this occasion,the ambassadors of Elaious are presumed to have been awarded Athenian citizenship, since they were invited to dine ( επιgrave δεῖπνον not ξένια ) in the prytaneion ( IG ii² 228 = Osborne ( 1981 ) D 15 ). In C4 a citizen of Elaious was granted proxenia by Chios ( PEP Chios 50 . 10 ). Elaious is known to have possessed a safe harbour at the southern entrance of the Hellespont (Hdt. 6 . 140 . 1 ; Thuc. 8 . 101 ) and at the eastern end of Morto Bay (Picard and Reinach ( 1912 ) 314 -15 ; cf. Isaac ( 1986 ) 192 -93 ). The sieges of Elaious in 411 (Thuc. 8 . 103 . 1 ) and in 360 (Dem. 23 . 158 ) indicate that the town was fortified in the Classical period. The tomb and sanctuary of Protesilaos were situated in the immediate vicinity of the city (Hdt. 7 . 33 , 9 . 116 ; Thuc. 8 . 102 ; Arr. An . 1 . 11 . 5 ; Plin. HN 4 . 11 . 49 ; cf. Strabo 7 fr. 51 ( 52 ): Πρωτεσιλάειον ). The Protesilaeion was tentatively identified with a prehistoric mound on the western shore of the bay (Casson ( 1926 ) 217 -18 ). Excavations of the cemetery of Elaious have confirmed both the first foundation of the city in C7l as an Athenian (or Aiolian) colony and the unambiguous Athenian predominance after 550 (Pottier ( 1915 ); CRAI ( 1915 ) 268 ff, ( 1916 ) 40 ff, ( 1921 ) 130 ff; cf. BCH 44 ( 1920 ) 411 ; Waiblinger ( 1978 )). Elaious struck bronze coins from c. 350 to 281 : obv . prow, head of Athena, or of Artemis; rev . wreath, or owl, or bee; legend: ΕΛΑΙ , ΕΛΑΙΟΥΣΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 259 -60 ; SNG Cop. Thrace 889 -98 )."

The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C4s coins ( infra ) and externally in Hegesippos'speech about the Chersonesos (Dem. 7 . 41 -44 ). The individual and external use is found in an Epidaurian proxeny decree ( IG iv² 49 . 4 (C4l)) and in an Attic funerary inscription ( IG ii² 8961 (C4 )). Kardia was situated at the southern end of the Gulf of Melas (Ps.-Skylax 67 ; Strabo 7 fr. 51 ; cf. Plin.

Kardia is considered to be the first polis of the Thracian Chersonesos (Ps.-Skymnos 698 -99 ; Strabo 7 fr. 51 ; cf. Dem. 5 . 25 ) at a distance of 420 stadia from the southernmost tip at Elaious (no. 663 ) (Hdt. 6 . 36 . 2 ) or 400 stadia according to Ps.-Skylax 67 . It is tentatively located at Cape Bakla Burnu, west of Baklar Liman (cf. Kahrstedt ( 1954 ) 13 -14 ; Isaac ( 1986 ) 188 with n. 162 ). Kardia was founded by Milesians (no. 854 ) and Klazomenians (no. 847 ), and refounded in C6m by Athenians under Miltiades the Elder (Ps.-Skymnos 700 -3 ; cf. Strabo 7 fr. 51 ). The name of its ktistes was either Hermochares (Steph. Byz. 358 . 3 -4 ) or Hermokrates of Miletos (schol. Dem. 5 . 25 no. 38 , Dilts). An anecdote told by Charon of Lampsakos ( FGrHist 262 ) fr. 1 indicates that the Kardians were defeated by the Bisaltians in a battle fought in, probably, C6 . Kobrys and probably also Kypasis, emporia on the adjacent coast south of the estuary of the river Melas, are said to have belonged to the Kardianoi (Ps.-Skylax 67 ). Holding a key location for the Chersonesos (Dem. 23 . 182 ), Kardia was used by Miltiades II as a port of his capital in Chersonesos/Agora (Hdt. 6 . 41 . 1 ), and is said to have escaped occupation by the Phoenician fleet in the Ionian Revolt (Hdt. 6 . 33 . 1 ). Kardia's absence from the Athenian tribute lists is usually explained by assuming that, together with other unnamed neighbouring cities, it is included among the Χερσονησῖται , later the Χερσονησῖται απ ' αγοραtildeς (Kahrstedt ( 1954 ) 18 ; Isaac ( 1986 ) 188 ). In the troubled period following the defeat of Athens, Kardia fell under Thracian rule and became an operational base ( οasperρ µ ητήριον ) for Charidemos under Kotys and his successors. Charidemos and the Kardians murdered the pretender Miltokythes, who was allied with Athens (Dem. 23 . 169 , 175 ), and the city was explicitly excluded from all treaties between the Athenians and the Thracian kings (Dem. 23 . 181 -82 ; cf. Diod. 16 . 34 . 4 for the treaty of 353 / 2 ). After the eclipse of the Thracian kingdom, Kardia refused to admit Athenian klerouchs (Dem. 8 hypoth . 2 ; Diod. 16 . 34 . 4 ) and became allied with Philip II (Dem. 12 . 11 ), probably as early as 352 (Hammond and Griffith ( 1979 ) 380 -81 ). He protected the city against attacks from the Athenian klerouchs and offered, in vain, the Athenians to settle the dispute by arbitration (Dem. 7 . 41 -44 ). The Athenians refused, whereupon Philip sent a force to Kardia (Dem. 8 . 58 , 64 , hypoth . 2 , 12 . 11 ). The Kardianoi are believed to have participated in 338 / 7 in the League of Corinth (city-ethnic tentatively restored in IG ii² 236 b 7 by Kahrstedt ( 1954 ) 37 -38 ). During the reign of Alexander, Kardia was ruled by a tyrant, Hekataios (Plut. Eum . 3 . 6 ), and in C4l ' Ηγησίστρατος ' Εκαταίου Καρδιανός , presumably the son of the tyrant, was proclaimed proxenos and theorodokos of Asklepios and was granted ateleia and asylia in Epidauros ( IG iv² . 1 49 ). Kardia is said to have a gymnasion in C4 (Plut. Eum . 1 ). Kardia struck bronze coins, probably from 350 to 309 , when the city seems to have been incorporated into Lysimacheia: obv . head of Demeter wearing corn wreath, or lion, or lion's head; rev . lion, or corn-grain in linear square.

The toponym is Κριθώτη (Hellan. fr. 27 ; Isoc. 15 . 112 ) or Κριθωτή (Ps.Skylax 67 ; Strabo 7 fr. 55 ). The city-ethnic is Κριθουacuteσιος on C4s coins ( infra ). Isoc. 15 . 107 -8 calls Krithote a polis in both the political and the urban senses. In Ps.-Skylax 67 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Κριθώτη is the tenth of eleven toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested on C4s coins ( infra ). Krithote is listed among the cities of the Hellespontine coast south of Paktye (no. 671 ) and north of Kressa (no. 666 ) (Ps.-Skylax 67 ) or north of Madytos (Ps.-Skymnos 711 ) or north of Kallipolis (Strabo 7 fr. 55 ) or between Tiristasis and Cissa (Plin. HN 4 . 48 ). According to Steph. Byz. 384 . 18 -19 , it was situated at a distance of 80 stadia from Kardia (no. 665 ). Krithote must be located somewhere near modern Gelibolu (Isaac ( 1986 ) 191 ), and probably to the north (Kahrstedt ( 1954 ) 10 -11 ) rather than to the south ( Barr .). Krithote was founded by the Athenians under Miltiades (Ephor. fr. 40 ; Ps.-Skymnos 712 ; see Obst ( 1932 )). Never listed independently as a member of the Delian League, Krithote was presumably included among the Chersonesitae in the tribute lists. Occupied by Ariobarzanes in C4e, it was recovered by the Athenians under Timotheos (Isoc. 15 . 108 , 112 ). Later besieged by the Thracians under Charidemos (Dem. 23 . 158 ), it remained, with Elaious (no. 663 ), an Athenian possession. The mention of a siege shows that Krithote was fortified. Krithote struck bronze coins from c. 350 to 281 . Obv . head of Demeter, or of Athena; rev . corn-grain; legend: ΚΡΙ or ΚΡΙΘΟ or ΚΡΙΘΟΥΣΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 259 ; SNG Cop. Thrace 886 -88 ; cf.

The toponym is Λί µ ναι , αιasper (Hecat. fr. 164 ; Anaximenes ( FGrHist 72 ) fr. 26 ; Ps.-Skymnos 705 ). The city-ethnic is Λι µ ναῖος ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 107 ). In the Athenian tribute list of 429 / 8 the Limnaioi are recorded under the heading πόλες αιasperacuteδε ( IG i³ 282 B. i . 11 -13 ). Limnai is listed as a πόλις εν ' ΕλλησπόντΩsubiotaω περιgrave Σηστόν by Steph. Byz. 417 . 11 , quoting Hecat. fr. 164 , but in such a way that we cannot be sure whether Hekataios is his authority for the toponym only or for the siteclassification as well (Hansen ( 1997 a ) 18 ). However,its status as a polis is confirmed both by its membership of the Delian League ( infra ) and by its status as a colony of Miletos (no. 854 ). The city-ethnic is unattested in literary sources,but the collective and external use is recorded in the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ). In Ps.-Skymnos 705 , Limnai is located west of Lysimacheia and east of Alopekonnesos (no. 659 ). In Strabo 7 fr. 51 , it is located west of Kardia (no. 665 ) and Drabos and east of Alopekonnesos.Isaac ( 1986 ) 189 states:'in the tribute lists it appears between Elaious and Alopekonnesos' .But the only attestation of this sequence is in IG i³ 272 . ii . 30 -34 , where all ethnics are completely restored. Nevertheless, following Isaac, Barr . locates Limnai south of Alopekonnesos. Limnai was colonised by Milesians (Anaximenes ( FGrHist 72 ) fr. 26 ; Ps.-Skymnos 705 ). It was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 97 ) to ( IG i³ 282 . i . 13 ) a total of thirteen times, five times completely restored, paying a phoros of 2 , 000 dr. in 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 97 ), reduced to 500 dr.in or before 442 / 1 ( IG i³ 270 . ii . 11 ) and raised to 1 , 000 dr. in the years 433 / 2 -429 / 8 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 25 ). In 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 67 , restored) and 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 B. i . 13 ) the Limnaioi are recorded (together with the Χερρονεσῖται απ ' Αγοραtildeς ) as having paid their tribute to the archontes ; presumably they had to contribute to the maintenance of magistrates established in these two cities, following the special measures instituted by the Athenians in the Hellespontine district; cf. Thuc. 2 . 24 . 1 . Limnai, not mentioned by Ps.-Skylax,is believed to have vanished by C4 ."

The toponym is Μάδυτος , ηasper (Hecat. fr. 165 ; Hdt. 9 . 120 . 4 ; Ps.-Skymnos 709 ). The cityethnic is Μαδυacuteτιος ( IG i³ 1144 . ii . 34 ( 464 )). It is called a polis in the urban sense by Hdt. 9 . 120 . 4 . In Ps.-Skylax 67 , Μάδυτος is the seventh of eleven toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense. The political sense is attested in the Athenian tribute lists, where Madytos appears under the heading h αίδε ( πόλεις ) ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 51 ). The C4s mint is further evidence for polis status in the political sense ( infra ). The collective form of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 34 ). The individual and external use is attested only in one late inscription ( IGRR I 822 ). Madytos is listed between Elaious (no. 663 ) and Sestos (no. 672 ) (Ps.-Skylax 67 ; cf. Ps.-Skymnos 709 -10 ), to the east of Cape Kynos Sema and the site of Hekuba's tomb,and west of Cape Sestias (Strabo 7 fr. 55 ); together with Sestos it lay at the narrowest part of the Hellespont (Ps.-Skymnos 709 -10 ). The Kynos Sema or tomb of Hekuba (Strabo 7 fr. 55 ) presumably belonged to its territory, as indicated by the representation of a seated dog on the reverse of Madytos' coins ( infra ). The toponym survived through the centuries in the modern village of Maïto (now Eceabat), where several antiquities-including inscriptions-were discovered,confirming the identification (Hauvette-Besnault ( 1880 ) 506 -10 ; Picard and Reinach ( 1912 ) 306 -12 ; IGRR i 822 ; cf. Robert ( 1948 ) 38 -39 ; BE ( 1972 ) 279 ; Isaac ( 1986 ) 194 ). Madytos was colonised by Lesbians (Ps.-Skymnos 709 -10 ), presumably in C7 (Isaac ( 1986 ) 161 ), and in any case before the arrival of the Athenian colonists under Miltiades the Elder ( supra 900 ). Some Madytians are listed in the Athenian casualty list of c. 465 ( IG i³ 1144 . 34 -38 ), indicating that the city was a member of the Delian League. Madytos belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 445 / 4 ( IG i³ 267 . v . 3 , completely restored) to 421 / 0 ( IG i³ 285 . ii . 79 ) a total of twelve times, six times completely restored, paying 500 dr. ( IG i³ 270 . ii . 12 ), attested until 440 / 39 ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 32 ), later raised to 2 , 000 dr., attested from 435 / 4 ( IG i³ 277 . v . 5 ). In 430 / 29 Madytos is listed among those cities in the Hellespontine district whose tribute ( phoros ) of 1 , 920 dr. took the form of pay ( misthos ), presumably a contribution to the maintenance of the hellespontophylakes ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 42 -43 and 51 ; cf. Thuc. 2 . 24 . 1 ). Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 3 indicates that it possessed a good harbour, which served as a base for the Athenian fleet in 411 (cf. Casson ( 1926 ) 212 ff). In 346 / 5 Madytos joined other cities of the Chersonesos in awarding Athens a golden crown ( IG ii² 1443 . 98 ). Madytos struck bronze coins in C4s.

The toponym is Πακτυacuteη (Hellan. fr. 127 ; Hdt. 6 . 36 . 2 ). The city-ethnic remains unattested. The only source in which Paktye is described as a polis is the late Heltic Ps.-Skymnos 711 , but in Ps.-Skylax 67 Πακτυacuteη is the last of eleven toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense. According to Ps.-Skymnos 711 -12 , Paktye was founded by the Athenians under Miltiades, i.e. in C6 . Kahrstedt ( 1954 ) 20 n. 47 and Isaac ( 1986 ) 196 -97 suggest that Paktye in C5 -C4 was a second-order settlement and a dependency of the polis of Chersonesos/Agora (no. 661 ), a view which seems to be contradicted by the only source we have (Ps.-Skylax). It should be noted, however, that Paktye is never included in the Athenian tribute lists and is not known to have minted coins. Paktye was situated on the Propontic coast of the isthmus of the Chersonesos (Strabo 7 frr. 52 and 54 ), near the site of Helle's tomb (Hellan. fr. 127 ), at the eastern end of the fortification wall constructed by Miltiades across the isthmus (Hdt. 6 . 36 . 8 ; Strabo 7 fr. 54 ; Plin. HN 4 . 48 ). It lay east of Krithote (no. 667 ) and west of Leuke Akte and the Hieron Oros (Ps.-Skylax 67 ; Ps.-Skymnos 711 -12 ; Strabo 7 fr. 56 ), at a distance of 40 stadia from Kardia (no. 665 ), which occupied the western end of the isthmus (Ps.-Skylax 67 ). Alkibiades is said to have sought refuge in Paktye in 408 (Diod. 13 . 74 . 2 ; Nep. Alc . 7 . 4 ). Its exact location remains uncertain (cf. Kahrstedt ( 1954 ) 13 -14 ; Isaac ( 1986 ) 197 )."

The toponym is Σηστός , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 78 ; Thuc. 1 . 89 . 2 ; IG ii² 274 . 3 (C4m)) or οasper (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 5 ; Ephor. fr. 155 ); cf. Hom. Il . 2 . 836 . The city-ethnic is Σήστιος ( MDAI ( 1957 ) 165 -692 = IG xii . 643 . 3 (C4s)). Sestos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 7 . 33 ; Thuc. 8 . 62 . 3 ; Isoc. 15 . 107 -8 ) and in the political sense (Isoc. 15 . 107 -8 ). Furthermore,after the heading αιasperacuteδε πόλεις , the Sestians are recorded in the Athenian tribute lists as members of the Delian League ( IG i³ 282 B. i . 20 ), and Sestos is recorded in Ps.-Skylax's list of cities on the Chersonesos ( 67 ). The collective form of the city-ethnic is attested internally on Heltic coins ( ΣΕΣΤΙ , SNG Cop. Thrace 943 ), and externally in literary (Dem. 23 . 160 ) and epigraphical sources ( IG i³ 267 . iv . 33 ). For the individual and external use, see MDAI ( 1957 ) 165 -69 2 = IG xii . 6 43 . 3 , Samos (C4s); IG ii² 10262 -64 , Athens (C4 ). Sestos lay at the narrowest part of the Hellespont, opposite Abydos (no. 765 ), east of Cape Sestias where the bridge constructed by Xerxes touched the coast of Europe (Hdt. 7 . 33 -34 ; Thuc. 8 . 62 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 5 ; Ps.-Skylax 67 ; Polyb. 16 . 29 . 3 -14 ; Strabo 2 . 5 . 22 , 7 frr. 51 , 55 , 13 . 1 . 22 ; Ps.-Skymnos 709 -10 ). It is probably to be located near Yalova, in the little bay of Ak-Bachi, on the dominating hill of the Teke of Ak-Bachi (Isaac ( 1986 ) 195 , mentioning only a mediaeval castle and monastery). Sestos was colonised by Lesbians (Ps.-Skymnos 709 -10 ; Eustath. in Dionys. Per. 513 = GGM ii . 314 . 43 , quoting the lost part of Strabo 7 ), presumably in C7 (Isaac ( 1986 ) 161 ), and in any case before the arrival of Athenian colonists in C6 ( supra 900 ). Sestos was conquered by the Persians alongside all the other cities that were part of Miltiades' Chersonesitan state (Hdt. 6 . 33 , 39 ), and governed by Artayktes (Hdt. 7 . 33 , 78 , 9 . 116 -22 ). The city was besieged and captured by the Athenians in 479 / 8 (Hdt. 9 . 114 -19 ; Thuc. 1 . 89 . 2 ; Diod. 11 . 37 . 4 -5 ). Sestos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 446 / 5 ( IG i³ 266 . v . 24 ) to 421 / 0 ( IG i³ 285 . ii . 74 ) a total of thirteen times, five times completely restored, paying a phoros of 500 dr. ( IG i³ 270 . ii . 10 ) until 435 / 4 , when it was raised to 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 277 . v . 7 ). In 429 / 8 Sestos is listed (with Alopekonnesos (no. 659 )) among poleis which καταδελ ˜ οσι τοgrave µ φόρον (present a voucher for tribute), presumably contributing to the maintenance of the hellespontophylakes and serving as bases for the fleet patrolling the Hellespontine waters ( IG i³ 282 B. i . 20 ; cf. Thuc. 2 . 24 . 1 ; Bradeen and McGregor ( 1973 ) 3 -23 ). Thanks to its strategic location for seafaring and the excellence of its harbour, Sestos served as a main base and strong point ( phrourion ) for the Athenian fleet in 411 (Thuc. 8 . 62 . 2 , φρουacuteριον ; cf. 102 . 1 , 104 . 1 , 107 . 1 ; Xen.

After the battle at Aigos potamoi in 405 , it was occupied by Lysandros (Diod. 13 . 106 . 8 ), who expelled the Sestians and gave the city and its territory to his officers; the Lakedaimonians, however, soon decreed that the Sestians should be restored to their country (Plut.

The toponym is Βισάνθη , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 137 . 3 ; Xen. An . 7 . 2 . 38 ; IG i³ 77 . iv . 10 ). The city-ethnic is Βισανθηνός (C3f coins: Head, HN ² 266 ; Schönert-Geiss ( 1975 ) 1 -11 ). The only explicit reference to Bisanthe as a polis is in Steph. Byz. 171 . 3 ; cf. oppidum in Plin. HN 4 . 11 . 43 . But polis status in the Classical period can be inferred from the attestation of Bisanthe in the Athenian assessment decree of 422 / 1 ( infra ), combined with the Heltic evidence (C3f coins, attestation in the C3l Delphic theorodokoi list ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 96 ); cf. Robert ( 1948 ) 54 -55 ). The internal and collective form of the cityethnic appears on Heltic coins ( supra ). The external and individual use is attested in Heltic inscriptions ( IG xii . 9 1126 (C?), from Chalkis; F.Delphes iii . 4 133 i . 18 , ii . 27 -28 ( 208 )). Bisanthe was situated on the Thracian coast of the Propontis and, on the evidence of Ptol. Geog . 3 . 11 . 4 , it is usually identified with mediaeval Rhaidestos = modern Tekirdag. However, Sayar ( 1992 ) 187 -89 and ( 1998 ) 62 -63 has recently defended the alternative equation of Bisanthe with Paniai in Ps.-Skylax 67 , a conjecture of MS Γανίαι = Byzantine Panion and modern Panados/ Baniado/Barbaros ( ATL i. 475 -76 ; cf. Isaac ( 1986 ) 213 ). The identification with Tekirdag seems preferable. Bisanthe was a colony founded by the Samians (no. 864 ) (Steph. Byz. 171 . 3 : άποικος Σα µ ίων ; Pompon. 2 . 24 : Bisanthe Samiorum ). It may initially have belonged to the extended territory of Perinthos (no. 678 ) as a dependent polis , like Tyrodiza (no. 681 ), whose fate it must have shared during C6l and C5e. However, it is usually believed to have fallen under Odrysian rule in 430 , when a Peloponnesian embassy on its way to meet the Persian king was treacherously arrested by Sitalkes and Nymphodoros in Bisanthe and extradited to the Athenians (Hdt. 7 . 137 . 2 -3 ; cf. Thuc. 2 . 67 ). Bisanthe is indisputably listed as a member of the Delian League in the assessment decree of 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 10 ) and as belonging to the Hellespontine district, and the toponym is restored in the assessment decrees of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 20 ) and 410 / 9 ( IG i³ 100 . iii . 9 ). It is recorded alongside Paktye, Ornoi and Neon Teichos as one of the strongholds ( teiche ) held soon after 410 byAlkibiades,who appears to have closely collaborated with the Thracian kings Medokos and Seuthes (Plut. Alc. 30 . 10 (r 408 ), 36 . 3 -5 ; Lys. 10 . 4 ; Diod. 13 . 105 . 3 -4 ; Nep. Alc. 7 . 4 ; cf. Lys. 14 . 26 ). A few years later ( 400 -399 ), Bisanthe-the fairest of Seuthes' possessions on the coast-was repeatedly offered to Xenophon by the Thracian dynast Seuthes II (Xen. An. 7 . 2 . 38 ; cf. 5 . 8 ).

674,Byzantion (Byzantios),Propontic Thrace,41.0,28.55,3925,19397,"674 . Byzantion (Byzantios) Map 52 . Lat. 41 . 00 , long. 28 . 55 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Βυζάντιον , τό (Thuc. 8 . 80 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 3 . 14 ; Xen. An . 7 . 1 . 7 ; IG i³ 1162 . 49 (C5m)). The city-ethnic is Βυζάντιος ( SEG 32 412 . 7 -8 (C5e); IG vii 2418 . 9 (C4m); Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 19 ; Dem. 15 . 3 ). Byzantion is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 4 . 87 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 17 -19 ; An . 7 . 1 . 17 -19 ; Dem. 18 . 87 ; Archestratos fr. 39 . 8 , Olson and Sens) and in the political sense (Hdt. 5 . 103 . 2 ; Xen. An . 7 . 1 . 27 ; Dem. 8 . 15 ; IByz . 4 . 3 (C4l) = IvO 45 and 9 . 3 (C4 )). Polites and astos are used synonymously at Arist. Oec . 1346 a 27 -29 . The collective use of the city-ethnic (abbreviated as BY) is found internally on C5l-C4 coins ( infra ) and externally in inscriptions ( IG i³ 1144 . 118 (C5f); IG ii² 43 . 83 ( 378 / 7 )) and in literature (Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 16 ; Isoc. 14 . 28 ; Dem. 15 . 3 ; Arist. Pol . 1303 a 33 ). The individual and external use of the ethnic is attested in inscriptions ( SEG 32 . 412 , Olympia (C5f); SEG 18 . 180 , Delphi (C4s); IG ii² 8434 -35 , Athens (C4 )) and in literature (Hdt. 4 . 138 . 1 ; Dem. 20 . 61 ). The city of Byzantion occupied the head of the promontory between the Golden Horn, the Bosporos and the Propontis. Its favourable geographical position from both a military and an economic point of view is frequently noted in our sources and contrasted with the less favourable position of Kalchedon (no. 743 ) (Hdt. 4 . 144 . 2 ; Polyb. 4 . 38 . 1 ; Strabo 7 . 6 . 2 ; Dio Cass. 75 . 10 . 1 ). Except from the west,the city was protected by the sea and, to the south-east, by a precipitous shoreline. A particular conjunction of currents and winds forced all ships coming from the Black Sea to sail close to the fortifications of Byzantion, which meant that the city could control all navigation from the north through the Bosporos (Polyb. 4 . 44 . 3 -11 ). For the same reason, large shoals of spawning mackerel and tuna migrated from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea near the west shore of the Bosporos and provided the Byzantians with great quantities of easily obtainable food (Archestratos fr. 38 ; Arist. Pol . 1291 b 23 ). The territory of Byzantion comprised the eastern part of the Thracian peninsula between the Black Sea to the north, the Bosporos to the east and the Propontis to the south. It covered an area of some 1 , 500 km ² . The western frontier stretched overland from a point west of the Derkos (Delkos) Sea in the north to the river Athyras (Kara Su), and then along it to the Athyras (Büyükcekmeçe) Sea in the south (Strabo 7 fr. 56 ; Plin. HN 4 . 46 ; Pompon. 2 . 24 ). It encompassed to the north a locality called Phileas or Philia situated on a promontory of the same name stretching into the Black Sea (Ps.-Skymnos 722 -23 ). To the north, Byzantion bordered on the domain of Thracian dynasts (Polyb. 4 . 45 . 1 ). To the south Byzantion bordered on Selymbria (no. 679 ) (Dem. 15 . 26 ). On the other hand, the possession of the sanctuary of Zeus Ourios on the east side of the Bosporos opposite the entrance to the Black Sea was a bone of contention between Byzantion and Kalchedon (Diod. 20 . 111 . 3 (r 302 ); Polyb. 4 . 50 . 3 ). According to some sources, Byzantion was a colony of Megara (no. 225 ) (Ps.-Skymnos 717 ; Philostr. VS 24 ). Vell. Pat. 2 . 7 . 7 , however, lists Byzantion along with Kyzikos (no. 747 ) as foundations of Miletos (no. 854 ). Late authors of local history as a rule point to Megara as the founder of Byzantion, but they also mention Sparta (no. 345 ), Argos (no. 347 ), Corinth (no. 227 ), Mykenai (no. 353 ), Karystos (no. 373 ), Boiotia and Athens (no. 361 ) (Dion.Byzant. Anapl. Bosp. , passim ; Lydus, Mag. 3 . 70 ; Hsch. Patria 3 -5 ; Const. Porphyr. De them . ii p. 46 , Bonn). Probably, the majority of colonists came from Megara, while some contingents were supplied by their immediate neighbours, especially Argos, Corinth and Boiotia. Such a scenario is confirmed by Aristotle's report of a stasis between the original colonists and a later contingent of different stock, resulting in the expulsion of the newcomers ( Pol . 1303 a 25 , 32 -33 ). The incident is probably to be dated to the Archaic period (Gehrke, Stasis 34 ). The Megarian majority came to dominate Byzantion, as attested by its Doric dialect, its cults, its onomastics and its institutions (division of the civic body into hekatostyes and a hieromnamon as the eponymous official). According to a well-known anecdote (Hdt. 4 . 144 . 2 ), Byzantion was founded seventeen years after Kalchedon.As the foundation year Euseb. Chron . versus Arm. records Olymp. 30 . 1 = 660 / 59 (Schoene ii 86 ), and the Hieronymus adaptation Olymp. 30 . 2 = 659 / 8 ( 94 b, Helm) or, in another manuscript, Olymp. 30 . 3 = 658 / 7 (Schoene ii 87 ). The year of the foundation of Kalchedon as indicated by the Hieronymus adaptation is Olymp. 23 . 4 = 685 / 4 ( 93 b,Helm). The difference between the sources amounts to only nine years, and we may assume that the foundation of Byzantion took place around 660 . From the foundation onwards the Byzantians were involved in constant warfare with neighbouring Thracian tribes (Polyb. 4 . 45 . 1 ; Diod. 14 . 12 . 2 (r 403 )). Byzantion joined the Ionian Revolt in 499 -494 and, after its suppression by Persia, the Byzantians and the Kalchedonians fled to the Pontic region and settled down in Mesambria (no. 687 ) (Hdt. 6 . 33 . 2 ), reinforcing the original contingent of colonists from Megara and Kalchedon ( infra 935 ). Byzantion was a member of the Delian League, and was probably among the original members ( ATL iii. 206 ). In the early years of the Delian League Byzantion supplied ships rather than paying tribute.Thus,an Athenian casualty list of c. 465 records names of Byzantians killed in a naval battle near Sigeion ( IG i³ 1144 . 118 -28 ). Byzantion belonged to the Hellespontine district ( IG i³ 269 . ii . 26 ) and is registered in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 7 ) to 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 . 39 , completely but plausibly restored) a total of fourteen times, three times completely restored, paying a phoros of 15 tal. in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . v . 16 ), surpassed only by the 30 tal. paid by Aigina (no. 358 ). The tribute was raised to 15 tal., 4 , 300 dr. in 443 / 2 ( IG i³ 269 . ii . 26 ) and to 18 tal. 1 , 800 dr. in 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 32 ). In 430 / 29 Byzantion paid a phoros of 21 tal. and 3 , 420 dr. ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 18 ) in addition to 855 dr. for special measures taken by Athens in the Hellespontine and Bosporos regions ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 49 ). Byzantion was possibly assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 175 , completely restored). Byzantion revolted in 441 / 0 , supporting Samos (no. 864 ) in her conflict with Athens (Thuc. 1 . 115 . 5 ), but was recovered in spring or early summer 439 after the subjugation of Samos (Thuc. 1 . 117 . 3 ). Byzantion defected from the League once again in 411 after the Sicilian disaster (Thuc. 8 . 80 . 3 ; cf. Diod. 13 . 34 . 2 ).A Spartan garrison under a harmost was placed in the city (Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 15 ), but it was expelled in 408 when the city was betrayed to the Athenians under Alkibiades (Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 20 -22 ; cf. Losada ( 1972 ) 22 ). Thereafter Byzantion remained loyal to Athens until after the battle of Aigos potamoi (Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 1 ). In C4e Byzantion formed an alliance together with Kyzikos (no. 747 ), Ephesos (no. 844 ), Samos (no. 864 ), Iasos (no. 891 ), Knidos (no. 903 ), Rhodos (no. 1000 ) and possibly Lampsakos (no. 748 ), Thebes (no. 221 ), Kroton (no. 56 ) and Zakynthos (no. 141 ). This alliance is known only through a series of silver coins weighing c. 11 g (tridrachm of Rhodian standard or didrachm of Aiginetan standard), and all with the same obv . type: infant Herakles strangling snakes and the legend ΣΥΝ ( µ αχια ); on the rev . each of the allied cities placed its emblem,i.e.in the case of Byzantion a bull above a dolphin. The purpose of the alliance was to oppose Sparta (no. 345 ), and it was formed either in 394 after the battle of Knidos or in 387 / 6 after the King's Peace (Karwiese ( 1980 ); Schönert-Geiss ( 1970 ) 31 -35 ). Alongside Chios (no. 840 ), Rhodos (no. 1000 ) and Mytilene (no. 798 ), Byzantion was a founding member of the Second Athenian Naval League. A separate treaty between Athens and Byzantion was concluded in the autumn of 378 ( IG ii² 41 = Staatsverträge 256 ), and Byzantion is listed among the allies in the so-called Charter of the League ( IG ii² 43 . 83 = Staatsverträge 257 ). At the instigation of Epameinondas,Byzantion may briefly have left the League in 364 (Diod. 15 . 79 . 1 ; Isoc. 5 . 53 ; but see Buckler ( 1980 ) 170 -72 ; Hornblower ( 1982 ) 200 ). If so, it rejoined the League ( Staatsverträge 305 ) until-in collusion with Mausolos (Dem. 15 . 3 ; Hornblower ( 1982 ) 209 )-Byzantion, Chios, Rhodos and Kos (no. 497 ) revolted against Athens in 357 and started the so-called Social War (Dem. 15 . 3 ; Diod. 16 . 7 . 3 -4 ). When peace was concluded in 355 , Athens had to accept Byzantion's secession from the League (Isoc. 8 . 16 , 15 . 63 -64 ; Diod. 16 . 22 . 2 ; Staatsverträge 313 ). In 352 / 1 or later, a treaty was concluded between Byzantion and Philip of Makedon (Dem. 9 . 34 , 11 . 3 , 18 . 87 and 93 ; Staatsverträge 318 ), but when in 340 Philip attacked and besieged Byzantion a new treaty with Athens was concluded (Dem. 18 . 87 -89 ). Byzantine envoys are attested in 378 / 7 in connection with the treaty with Athens ( IG ii² 41 ) and in 355 in connection with Byzantion's financial contribution to Thebes (no. 221 ) during the Third Sacred War ( IG vii 2418 . 12 ). Demosthenes served as envoy to Byzantion in 341 (Dem. 18 . 244 ; Aeschin. 3 . 256 ). From the Classical period, only one grant of proxeny is attested: viz . to the Spartan harmost Klearchos in 409 / 8 (Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 35 ). Citizens of Byzantion received proxeny from Athens (Dem. 20 . 60 -63 (after 389 ); IG ii² 76 (before 378 / 7 ); IG ii² 235 ( 340 / 39 )), from Thebes ( IG vii 2408 ( 364 / 3 )); from Kos (no. 497 ) ( ICos ED 40 . 5 (C4 )) and from Olbia (no. 690 ) ( IGDOP 18 ( 340 -330 )). The original constitution of Byzantion is unknown. In the time of Dareios' campaign to Skythia the city was ruled by a tyrant (Hdt. 4 . 138 . 1 ). It is often assumed that Byzantion became a democracy when it joined the Delian League (Gehrke, Stasis 35 ) but we have no information. In the period 411 -408 Sparta had a harmost and a garrison in the city (Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 15 , 20 -22 ). In 408 an Athenian garrison took over but left the city after the defeat at Aigos potamoi in 405 (Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 1 ). After their victory, the Spartans introduced an oligarchic constitution supervised by a Spartan harmost (Xen. An . 6 . 2 . 13 , 7 . 2 . 5 -12 ) perhaps heading a dekarchy (Gehrke, Stasis 36 ). Stasis between factions of citizens is attested for the following period (Xen. An . 7 . 1 . 39 ; Diod. 14 . 12 . 2 -3 ). In 390 / 89 , with the help of the leaders of the democratic faction (Dem. 20 . 60 ), the Athenians under Thrasyboulos were admitted to the city and had the constitution replaced by a democracy (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 270 ), which seems to have remained in force for the rest of the Classical period (Theopomp. fr. 62 ; Arist. Pol . 1291 b 23 ); in 354 / 3 or slightly later, Byzantion intervened in Kalchedon (no. 743 ) and introduced a democratic constitution there (Dem. 15 . 26 ). Under the democracy, citizenship was confined to those whose parents were both citizens. During a financial crisis, however,it was decreed that citizenship could be bought for 30 minas (Arist. Oec . 1346 b 26 -29 ). The civic body was organised into hekatostyes . The oldest attestation is in an honorary decree for Eudamos of Seleukeia of c. 175 -170 ( IByz . 1 . 60 -61 ). But the presence of hekatostyes in other Megarian colonies in the Black Sea area (Kalchedon (no. 743 ), Herakleia (no. 715 ) and Chersonesos (no. 695 )) and in the mother city itself indicates that the institution goes back to the foundation of Byzantion (Jones, POAG 284 -85 ). The number of hekatostyes is unknown.At Arist. Oec . 1346 b 15 there is a stray reference to other civic subdivisions, viz . thiasoi and patrai , which, however, may have been private associations. Free non-citizens living in Byzantion are called metoikoi and were barred from owning landed property (Arist. Oec . 1347 a 1 -3 ). In 390 / 89 there were a large number of Athenians living in the city (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 27 ). The eponymous official of Byzantion,as of its mother city Megara before the Heltic period, was the hieromnamon (epichoric form always with the long Doric α ) ( IByz . 2 . 1 (C2m); cf. Polyb. 4 . 52 . 4 ). The legends ΕΠΙ ΚΛΕΩ and ΕΠΙ ΝΕ on coins of C4m probably refer to hieromnamones (Schönert-Geiss ( 1970 ) 131 -32 nos. 954 -78 ). The only known public enactment of the Classical period is an honorary decree ( psephisma ) for the Athenians passed by the Byzantians in 341 / 0 and read out to the Athenian Assembly (Dem. 18 . 89 ). The document inserted in Demosthenes' text 90 -91 , however, is a spurious composition of, probably, C2 (Wankel ( 1976 ) 497 -98 ). The patron deity of Byzantion may have been Apollo, as in the mother city Megara and in other Megarian colonies (Hanell ( 1934 ) 164 -70 ). In Heltic and later inscriptions, public enactments were set up in his sanctuary ( IByz . 1 . 48 -49 , 63 -64 ), and Apollo's head occurs on coins of C4 (Schönert-Geiss ( 1970 ) nos. 951 -953 ). Games may be deduced from an Archaic inscription mentioning a stadion -runner ( IByz . 42 . 3 ). In later times there was a festival called Bosporia devoted to Artemis Phosphoros-identified with the Thracian Bendis-during which a torch-race was held ( IByz . p. 40 ). Very little is known from contemporary sources about the cult places of Byzantion in the Archaic and Classical periods. Hdt. 4 . 87 . 2 mentions an altar of Artemis Orthosia (a typically Megarian epithet), a temple of Dionysos and a hieron at the entrance to the Black Sea (apparently not to be identified with the well-known hieron of Zeus Ourios on the east side of Bosporos but rather with its counterpart on the west side, called Sarapieion by Polyb. 4 . 39 . 6 ). Two cult places are mentioned in a Classical context by Dion. Byzant. Anapl. Bosp. 6 . 6 -10 , Güngerich: the temple of Hera which is said to have been destroyed by the Persians and the temple of Plouton demolished by Philip of Makedon. Furthermore, the temple of Poseidon on the promontory is described as being old ( 5 . 1 -2 ). For a list of cult places, some of which may have originated in the Classical period, see Miller ( 1899 ) 1146 -47 . Byzantion possessed a treasury in Olympia (Paus. 6 . 19 . 9 ; Ath. 480 A), and a C5e dedication of Pythion of Byzantion at Olympia may commemorate a victory in the Olympic Games ( SEG 32 412 ). Names of the months are attested in late sources only ( IByz . 2 , 30 , 31 , 33 ), but they resemble those of the other Megarian colonies: Kalchedon (no. 743 ), Herakleia Pontike (no. 715 ), Kallatis (no. 686 ) and Chersonesos (no. 695 ), and a Megarian origin for the calendar can be presumed (Hanell ( 1934 ) 190 -204 ; Trümpy, Monat . 147 -55 ). The citadel of Byzantion is called akra at Xen. An . 7 . 1 . 19 and akropolis at 7 . 1 . 20 . It was situated on the north-eastern tip of the promontory between the Golden Horn and the Propontis. It is completely covered by the Topkapi Saray of the Turkish sultans, and there are no physical remains. Byzantion had a defence circuit which, according to later local tradition, had been erected in connection with the foundation of the colony (Hsch. Patria 12 ). The walls were renowned for their strength (Paus. 4 . 31 . 5 ), and the description at Dio Cass. 75 . 10 . 3 -6 , 14 . 5 -6 is at least to some extent valid for the Classical period. The walls with numerous interval towers and gates (Xen. An . 7 . 1 . 12 , 15 -17 , 36 ; Hell . 1 . 3 . 20 ) were particularly strong on the landward side to the west; the sections towards the sea were considerably lower and protected against breakers by a mole (Xen. An . 7 . 1 . 17 ). During the siege in 340 part of the fortifications were strengthened with tombstones and was thereafter called τυ µ βασυacuteνη (Hsch. Patria 27 ). The original fortifications of Byzantion were destroyed by Septimius Severus (Dio Cass. 75 . 14 . 4 -5 ); no traces of them have been found. Byzantion was besieged in 478 / 7 by the Greeks (Thuc. 1 . 94 . 2 ), in 409 / 8 by the Athenians (Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 14 -20 ), in 357 / 6 by the Athenians (Diod. 16 . 21 . 3 ) and in 340 by Philip of Makedon (Dem. 8 . 14 , 18 . 71 , 93 ; Diod. 16 . 76 . 4 , 77 . 2 -3 ; Plut. Phoc . 14 . 4 -7 ). The city also possessed within its walls a vast uninhabited area called Thrakion (Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 20 ; An . 7 . 1 . 24 ), most likely intended as a place where the rural population could have been accommodated during a war. There are no remains of public architecture of the Archaic and Classical periods, and the written sources are silent apart from a reference to a gymnasion at Arist. Oec . 1346 b 19 . The context indicates that it was situated within the city walls. The existence of the stadium may be deduced from an Archaic inscription mentioning a stadion -runner ( IByz . 42 ). Byzantion's important commercial activities were centred on an agora, a limen and an emporion (Theopomp. fr. 62 ; Arist. Oec . 1346 b 18 -19 ; Xen. An . 7 . 1 . 19 ). Byzantion controlled all navigation through the Bosporos ( supra ); it sometimes seized ships belonging to other poleis (Arist. Oec . 1346 b 30 -31 ; Dem. 50 . 6 ), and during the Peloponnesian War the Athenians (or the Delian League) exacted dues from grain ships passing through the Bosporos ( IG i³ 61 . 34 -40 ( 426 / 5 ); cf. Rubel ( 2001 )). That the Byzantians struck coins of iron in C5s is suggested in old Attic comedies (Ar. Nub . 248 with schol.; Plato Com.fr. 103 , PCG ; Poll. 9 . 78 ; Hsch. s.v. σιδάρεος ; cf. LSAG p. 366 ). Not a single specimen has survived.The minting of silver coins started c. 411 . From 411 until c. 387 / 6 , drachms and hemidrachms were struck on the Persian standard, and from c. 387 / 86 until c. 340 / 39 tetradrachms, drachms and hemidrachms were struck on the Rhodian standard. The obv . type is invariably a bull above a dolphin, legend: BY in Archaic script with a Corinthian B; rev . types: incuse square punch,or trident (on drachms of Rhodian standard). In the same period Byzantion also struck some small denominations in silver with the same types-probably trihemiobols and hemiobols on the Persian standard-and six series of bronze coins with various types. Some have obv . head of Athena,or Demeter,or Apollo. One issue has the rev . legend ΕΠΙ ΚΛΕΩ or ΕΠΙ ΝΕ , presumably denoting the eponymous magistrate ( supra ). The animal of the bovidae family frequently occurring on the coins of Byzantion and designated here as a bull is sometimes identified as a cow and connected with the myth of Io (Schönert ( 1966 )). For the alliance coinage, inscribed ΣΥΝ , see supra (SchönertGeiss ( 1970 ); SNG Cop.Thrace 475 -85 )."

The toponym is ∆α µ ινοgraveν τεῖχος (Ps.-Skylax 67 ) or ∆αυacuteνιον τεῖχος (Steph. Byz. 222 . 2 ) or * ∆ά µ νιον τεῖχος (reconstructed from the city-ethnic). The city-ethnic is ∆αυνι [ οτε ] ιχίτης ( IG i³ 271 . i . 27 ) or ∆α µ νιοτειχίτης ( IG i³ 272 . i . 38 ). The only explicit reference to Daminon Teichos as a polis is in Steph. Byz. 222 . 2 . It is here considered a polis -undoubtedly a fortified teichos -on the evidence of its being a member of the Athenian League (Hellespontine district). In Ps.-Skylax 67 , Daminon Teichos is listed between Perinthos (no. 678 ) and Selymbria (no. 679 ). It has been tentatively identified with Baunnae , a mutatio situated 12 miles east of Perinthos-Herakleia ( It. Burd. 572 ), and hypothetically located at Eski Ereg ˘li = modern Gümüsyaka ( ATL i. 480 ; cf. Isaac ( 1986 ) 208 n. 294 ; Sayar ( 1998 ) 64 ). Daminon Teichos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 11 -12 ) to 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 20 ) a total of seventeen times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. down to 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . i . 104 ), raised to 2 tal., 4 , 000 dr.in 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 21 ), and still 2 tal. in 421 / 0 ( IG i³ 285 . ii . 84 )."
676,"Heraion, Heraion  Teichos (Heraites)",Propontic Thrace,41.0,27.4,562,2830,"676 . Heraion, Heraion Teichos (Heraites) Map 52 . Lat. 41 . 00 , long. 27 . 40 (in Barr . 27 . 45 ). Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym /asperacuteΗραιον , τό (Hdt. 4 . 90 . 2 ; Steph. Byz. 303 . 13 ) is plausibly identified with ' Ηραῖον τεῖχος (Dem. 3 . 4 ; F.Delphes iii . 3 207 . 3 (C3m)). The city-ethnic is ' Ηραιίτης ( IGBulg. i² 43 . 4 , Odessos (C1 )) or ' Ηραιdieresisacuteτης (ibid . 26 ) or ' Ηραείτης (Sayar ( 1992 ) 190 (C2l-C1e)). Heraion is called a polis in the urban sense by Hdt. 4 . 90 . 2 and in the confused entry of Steph. Byz. 303 . 13 -15 , who seems to record a polis and a teichos bearing the same name. The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested in a C2l-C1e dedication to Hermes Agoraios from the area of Rhaidestos/Tekir Dag (Sayar ( 1992 ) 190 -95 ). The individual and external use is found in a C3m decree from Delphi (no. 177 ) awarding proxenia to two of its citizens ( F.Delphes iii . 3 207 . 3 ) and in a C1 honorary decree from Odessos (no. 689 ) ( IGBulg. i² 43 ). It seems quite arbitrary with ATL i. 482 to identify Heraion Teichos with Neon Teichos (no. 824 ) and Didymon Teichos (no. 741 ); see also Isaac ( 1986 ) 203 and Sayar ( 1992 ) 191 -92 . Heraion was situated on the northern coast of the Propontis, near Perinthos (no. 678 ), at one end of the road to the sources of the river T earos and thence to Apollonia Pontike (no. 682 )-a total of four days'march (Hdt. 4 . 90 . 2 ). It is probably to be identified with the Roman mutatio Aerea ( It. Burd . 601 . 6 ) located at a distance of 16 miles from Herakleia (Perinthos) and 12 miles from Registo ( = Rhaidestos); cf. Hiereo in the Tab. Peut. ; Anon. Rav. 4 . 6 : Ereon. The data recorded in the Roman Itineraria fit an ancient settlement with remains of Classical, Heltic and Roman dateincluding a C4 inscription-situated east of the mouth of the stream Chitemblik, in the bay of Karaevlialti, c. 24 km west of Perinthos (Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 100 -2 ; Sayar ( 1992 ) 192 and ( 1998 ) 62 ). In Barr . Heraion Teichos is identified with the prehistoric/Classical settlement near the tumulus of Aytepe, c. 12 km north-west of Perinthos. According to Harp. Η 15 and Etym. Magn . 436 . 39 -40 , Heraion Teichos was a colony of Samos (no. 864 ). Alternatively,it has been suggested (Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 56 , 100 -2 ) that Heraion was a secondary colony, i.e. a sanctuary of the Samian Hera founded by the Samian colonists of Perinthos (no. 678 ) in the chora of the latter city; but, for fear of barbarian incursions, it later developed into a self-governing and strongly fortified settlement. Heraion Teichos is not attested in the Athenian tribute lists, but in C4m it is mentioned as an important stronghold under Kersebleptes' rule, successfully besieged by Philip II in 352 (Dem. 3 . 4 )."
677,Neapolis (Neopolites),Propontic Thrace,40.4,27.1,296,1435,"677 . Neapolis (Neopolites) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 40 , long. 27 . 10 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: B: α . The toponym is Νεάπολις ( IG i³ 270 . ii . 25 ), specifically qualified as απ ' Αθηνῶν ( IG i³ 272 . i . 29 ), presumably also as παραgrave Χερρόνε [ σον ] ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 105 -6 ). The city-ethnic is Νεοπολῖται ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 105 -6 ). Neapolis was a member of the Delian League, and the tribute lists and assessment decree (Hellespontine district) constitute the only sources for this community. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 442 / 1 ( IG i³ 270 . ii . 25 ) to 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 36 ) a total of six times, three times completely but at least once plausibly restored, paying 300 dr. in all years ( IG i³ 272 . i . 29 ). A location in the vicinity of the Thracian Chersonesos has been inferred from the qualifying epithet παραgrave Χερρόνε [ σον ], and the epithet απ ' Αθηνῶν indicates that it was an Athenian foundation. For its possible connection with the Athenian klerouchy settled c . 450 in Tyrodiza (no. 681 ), see Kahrstedt ( 1954 ) 22 and Isaac ( 1986 ) 204 . Neapolis was further equated, without positive evidence, with Herakleia, one of the Thracian teiche listed by Ps.-Skylax ( 67 ; cf. Ptol. Geog . 3 . 11 . 7 ) on the Propontic shore, between Paktye and Perinthos (no. 678 ) and located at modern Heraklitsa (Erikli; cf. ATL i. 475 and 525 )."
678,Perinthos (Perinthios),Propontic Thrace,41.0,28.0,1948,10223,"678 . Perinthos (Perinthios) Map 52 . Lat. 41 . 00 , long. 28 . 00 . Size of territory 5 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Πέρινθος , ηasper (Hdt. 5 . 2 . 2 ; Arist. Gen. an . 773 a 27 ), after Perinthos of Epidauros, the associate of Orestes (Steph. Byz. 517 . 18 ) or one of Herakles' lovers (schol. Ap. Rhod. 1 . 1207 b, Wendel).In the third or fourth century ad , Perinthos' name was changed to Herakleia, after Herakles, its mythical ktistes (Amm. Marc. 22 . 8 . 6 ; see Sayar ( 1998 ) 171 , EZ 1 ; Leschhorn ( 1984 ) 370 ). The city-ethnic is Περίνθιος (Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 21 ; SEG 12 391 , Samos (C6f)). Perinthos is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 67 ; see also Hdt. 6 . 33 . 1 : αιasperacuteδε ( sc . πόλεις ) and Diod. 16 . 74 -76 (r 340 ). The political sense is attested in IG ii² 43 . 78 and 84 , where Perinthos under the heading πόλεις is listed as one of the members of the Second Athenian Naval League. Perinthos is called asty at Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 21 . The term politai for Perinthians is used in Arist. Oec. 1351 a (rC4f). The collective use of the city-ethnic in its full form is attested internally on C4m bronze coins ( infra ) and externally in the ATL and on the stele listing the members of the Second Naval League ( infra ). The individual ethnic is used externally in a C4 -C3 comedy by Lynceus (fr. 1 . 2 , PCG ) and in a Delphic inscription ( F.Delphes iii . 3 207 . 3 ( 252 / 1 )). The name of Herakleia survives in modern Marmara Ereglisi, the town now occupying the site of ancient Perinthos-Herakleia (Sayar ( 1998 ) 59 -62 ). Situated at a distance of 630 stadia west of Byzantion according to Artemidoros ( 600 according to Demetrios of Skepsis in Strabo 7 fr. 56 ), it was situated west of Selymbria (no. 679 ) (Ps.-Skymnos 714 -15 ) between Neon Teichos and Daminon Teichos (no. 675 ) (Ps.-Skylax 67 ). For the identification of Perinthos with Marmara Ereglisi, see Robert ( 1974 a ) and, more recently, Sayar ( 1998 ). The territory of Perinthos was rigidly demarcated to the east by the rival presence of the Megarian colonies of Selymbria (no. 679 ) and Byzantion (no. 674 ) (Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 53 -61 ); a plausible natural frontier line has been sought in the region of Kinaliköprü (Sayar ( 1998 ) 64 ). From C5m, an independent settlement-Daminon Teichos (no. 675 )-is recorded between Perinthos and Selymbria. Moreover, at least during the period of Persian occupation in C5e, but probably also from the start, the territory of Perinthos was significantly extended westwards, since it appears to have included not only Tyrodiza (no. 681 ) (Hdt. 7 . 25 (r 480 )) but presumably also Heraion [Teichos] (no. 676 ) and Bisanthe (no. 673 ); see Hdt. 6 . 33 . 1 where Perinthos, Selymbria and Byzantion are the only poleis listed along the northern Propontic shore, and Perinthos is associated with ταgrave τείχεα ταgrave επιgrave Θρηίκης (Kahrstedt ( 1954 ) 9 -10 ). Subsequently, however, when Perinthos was a member of the Delian League, its territory must have been restricted to the immediate hinterland and have bordered on that of Heraion Teichos (Kahrstedt ( 1954 ) 21 ; Sayar ( 1998 ) 62 -64 ). To the north, the springs of the river Degirmen are believed to have constituted a plausible border (Sayar ( 1998 ) 63 ). Perinthos was a colony of Samos (no. 864 ) (Ps.-Skymnos 714 -15 ; Strabo 7 fr. 56 ; Plut. Mor . 303 E) and was founded in 602 (Hieron. Chron . 98 b, Helm) on the northernThracian-coast of the Propontis (Hdt. 5 . 1 . 1 -2 , 6 . 33 . 1 ; Ps.Skylax 67 ). The names of three of the old Ionic phylai are attested in an undated list of names, probably of ephebes ( SGDI 5723 ; cf. Jones, POAG 286 ). During its early years ( c. 570 -560 ), Samian Perinthos faced deadly attacks both from invading Paionian hordes (Hdt. 5 . 1 ; Strabo 7 fr. 41 ) and from its rival Megarian neighbours, who attempted to monopolise the Propontic coast but were repulsed with the assistance of forces from the mother city (Plut. Mor . 303 E-304 A; cf. Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 54 -56 ). Following Dareios'Skythian expedition,Perinthos was subdued by the Persians under Megabazos (Hdt. 5 . 1 -2 ); after the Ionian Revolt, it fell under Persian rule (Hdt. 6 . 33 . 1 ). Following the expulsion of the Persians from Thrace, Perinthos became a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . v . 3 ) to 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 22 ) a total of twelve times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 10 tal. ( IG i³ 269 . ii . 25 ), perhaps less in 418 / 17 . In 411 it probably joined the revolt of Byzantion (no. 674 ), only to be forced back into the League by Alkibiades in 410 (Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 21 ). Perinthian cavalry forces seem to be indicated by Xen. An . 7 . 2 . 8 . Perinthos joined the Second Athenian Naval League in 377 ( IG ii² 43 . 84 ); it fell temporarily under the rule of Ariobarzanes, and suffered variously under the pressure of the expansionist ambitions of Kotys, the Odrysian king (Dem. 23 . 142 ; cf. Arist. Oec . 1351 a ; cf. Isaac ( 1986 ) 207 ). The inability of Athens to provide effective protection against the renewed Thracian oppression under Kotys' successor Kersebleptes and the general Charidemos (Dem. 23 . 165 , 168 ), in 352 / 1 drove Perinthos, together with Byzantion and Amadokos, to conclude an alliance with Philip II ( Staatsverträge 318 ; schol. Aeschin. 2 . 81 ; cf. Sayar ( 1998 ) 72 with nn. 145 -46 ). After the defeat of Kersebleptes, Perinthos and Byzantion are believed to have established a sympoliteia (Polyb. 18 . 2 . 3 -5 ; cf. Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 147 -48 ; Sayar ( 1998 ) 72 with n. 147 ). A few years later ( 340 ), when the two cities refused to support the Makedonian king's anti-Athenian operations in the Chersonesos area, first Perinthos and subsequently Selymbria and Byzantion were unsuccessfully besieged by the Makedonian army (Theopomp.frr. 217 , 292 ; Philoch. fr. 162 (cf. fr. 54 ); Ephor. T 10 ; Diod. 16 . 74 -76 ; for a complete list of testimonia,cf.Sayar ( 1998 ) 51 -79 ). Perinthos joined Byzantion in voting unprecedented honours for Athens in gratitude for her decisive support on this occasion (Dem. 18 . 89 -91 ). The alliance with Philip was eventually renewed after the defeat of Athens at Chaironeia, and in 337 Perinthos joined the Makedonian king's Hellenic League together with the rest of the Greek cities in Thrace (Sayar ( 1998 ) 73 ). The probable predominance of the cult of Hera (Polias?) is attested by epigraphical evidence of the persistent devotion of the early colonists to the Hera of Samos ( SEG 12 391 ; cf. Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 97 -100 ), by the existence of a Heraion ( = Heraion Teichos) in the neighbourhood of Perinthos-initially probably on Perinthian territory itself-(cf. Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 100 -2 ), and by Perinthian coin types of Roman date (Schönert ( 1965 ) 134 nos. 255 -58 ; cf. Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 102 -3 and the recent publication of a C1 -C2 inscribed votive stele : Sayar ( 1998 ) no. 289 ). The cults of other Greek divinities, such as Zeus,Athena,Apollo, Artemis, Dionysos, Demeter, Isis/Sarapis and Kybele, are presumed from archaeological evidence and numismatic iconography (Schönert ( 1965 ) 55 -57 ; cf. Robert ( 1967 ) 106 ff; Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 103 ; Sayar ( 1998 ) 65 ). The calendar of Perinthos, preserved through lexicographic tradition, indicates a close connection with the calendar of metropolitan Samos,at least in its presumed Archaic form,supporting the hypothesis of a direct implantation in the colony of the religious life of Samos as well (Samuel ( 1972 ) 88 -89 ; Trümpy, Monat . 81 ff); cf. Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 96 -103 ). Perinthos occupied a headland 1 , 200 m long and 50 m high, linked to the Thracian mainland by an isthmus c. 200 m = 1 stadion wide (Diod. 16 . 76 ; cf. Plin. HN 4 . 47 ) and projecting eastwards to form a well-protected harbour (cf. πόλις καιgrave λι µ ήν in Ps.-Skylax 67 ). Its naturally fortified position was enhanced by strong defensive walls with towers (Diod. 16 . 74 ) capable of withstanding a prolonged siege (Xen. An. 7 . 2 . 10 ; Diod. 16 . 74 ff, following Ephor. (r 340 / 39 ). The area enclosed by the walls measured c. 75 ha. According to Hdt. 5 . 1 . 2 , there was a προάστειον , a term that probably signifies the area immediately outside the city wall, east of the neck of the peninsula.The urban centre (called an asty in Xen. Hell. 1 . 1 . 21 ), with closely packed, exceptionally tall houses, overtopping one another along the hill slope and separated by narrow alley-ways, had the appearance of a theatre (Diod. 16 . 76 . 2 ). Moreover, the privileged location of Perinthos at the intersection of important land and sea routes accounts for its importance as a market (Xen. An . 7 . 4 . 2 , 6 . 24 ). Archaeological investigation in Marmara Ereglisi has identified the location of two ancient harbours, to the north-east and west of the isthmus of the peninsula, with traces of ancient breakwaters; the western harbour is now completely silted up by alluvial deposits from the Baglar stream (Oberhummer ( 1938 ) 803 -4 ; Sayar ( 1998 ) 59 ).Visible remains of the fortification system,dated as early as C5 , have also been identified, protecting the acropolis (located on the higher, western part of the peninsula), as well as the lower city, mainly from the north and west (Sayar ( 1998 ) 60 , with refs.). The cavea of the theatre (diameter 140 m) can be seen on the southern slope of the acropolis,and there are traces of the stadion ( 240 m long, undated) on the west slope of the acropolis (ibid. with refs.). The cemetery extended over 3 -5 km to the north and west of the city walls (Sayar ( 1998 ) 60 -61 , with refs.). In C4m,Perinthos struck coins of silver and bronze on the Persian standard. Silver issues included didrachms, hemidrachms and obols. Types: obv . head of Zeus, or Demeter; rev . foreparts of two horses joined back to back; legend: ΠΕΡΙΝ or ΠΕ , sometimes also the first letters of, probably, a mint magistrate's name, e.g. ΚΙΣ . The bronze coins have the legend ΠΕΡΙΝΘΙΩΝ (Head, HN ² 270 ; Schönert-Geiss ( 1965 ), ( 1973 ); SNG Cop.Thrace 721 -22 )."
679,Selymbria (Selymbrianos),Propontic Thrace,41.05,28.15,1352,6535,"679 . Selymbria (Selymbrianos) Map 52 . Lat. 41 . 05 , long. 28 . 15 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Σηλυ µ βρία , ηasper (Xen. An . 7 . 5 . 15 ; cf. Hdt. 6 . 33 . 1 ) or Σηλυβρία (Polyb. 18 . 49 . 2 ) or Σαλυβρία ( IG i³ 1154 B. 5 ( 460 -450 )). The toponym is allegedly derived from Σήλυς and βρία , the Thracian word for polis (Strabo 7 . 6 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is Σηλυ µ βριανός (Pl. Prt . 316 D) or Σελυνβριανός ( IG i³ 118 . 13 ( 408 )) or Σηλυβριανός (Arist. Oec . 1348 b 33 ) or Σαλυπριανός ( IG ii² 10261 a (C4m)). Selymbria is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 67 ; see also Hdt. 6 . 33 . 1 : αιasperacuteδε ( sc . πόλεις ). The political sense is attested in Dem. 15 . 26 ; Arist. Oec . 1348 b 35 and IG ii² 43 . 78 and B 29 , where Selymbria under the heading πόλεις is listed as one of the members of the Second Athenian Naval League.The politeia of the Selymbrians is mentioned in the treaty with the Athenians of 408 ( IG i³ 118 . 10 -11 ). Epigraphic evidence indicates that Selymbria had become a kome of Byzantion or of Perinthos in the Roman period (Robert ( 1946 )); its absence from the list of Delphic theorodokoi in C3l being a probable terminus ante quem , Selymbria may have lost its autonomy at the time of the formation of the sympoliteia between Byzantion (no. 674 ) and Perinthos (no. 678 ), tentatively dated to the period of Philip II's unsuccessful efforts in 340 to bring the area under Makedonian control. The collective use of the city-ethnic (abbreviated as ΣΑΛΥ ) is attested internally on C5 coins ( infra ) and externally in the treaty with Athens ( IG i³ 118 . 30 ) and in Pl. Prt . 316 D.The individual ethnic is used externally in the C5l settlement with Athens ( IG i³ 118 . 42 ) and in a C5m epigram commemorating Pythagoras, son of Dionysios, a Selymbrian proxenos of Athens ( IG i³ 1154 ). Patris is found in IG i³ 1154 B (C5m). Selymbria is mentioned at Hdt. 6 . 33 . 1 as a polis east of Perinthos and the Thracian teiche , and west of Byzantion, and in Ps.-Skylax 67 it is recorded as a polis and a limen situated 500 stadia from the mouth of the Black Sea. Selymbria is identified with modern Silivri, which preserves a variant form of the ancient name. For sparse antiquities collected locally mostly during the nineteenth century, see Seure ( 1912 ) and Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 27 -38 with refs. Literary sources attest the existence of fortifications from C5l (Diod. 13 . 66 . 4 , 14 . 12 . 7 ; Plut. Alc . 30 . 2 ) to C4m (Dem. 18 . 77 , for which see infra ). According to Ps.-Skymnos 715 -16 , Selymbria was founded by Megara (no. 225 ) 'before Byzantion' ,some time in the second quarter of C7 (Isaac ( 1986 ) 210 ; Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 51 -53 ). The exact limits of its territory remain unidentified; it bordered the territory of Daminon Teichos (no. 675 ) to the west,that of Byzantion (no. 674 ) to the east-with two rivers, Athyras and Bathynias, mentioned in the border area (Strabo 7 fr. 56 ; cf. Plin. HN 4 . 47 ). Selymbria was conquered by the Persians after the Ionian Revolt (Hdt. 6 . 33 . 1 ). Following the expulsion of the Persians from Thrace, Selymbria became a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 16 ) to 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 17 ) a total of sixteen times, twice completely but convincingly restored, paying a phoros of 9 tal. in 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 16 ), 6 tal. from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 8 ) to 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 57 ), 5 tal. from 443 / 2 ( IG i³ 269 . ii . 9 ) to 439 / 8 ( IG i³ 273 . ii . 23 ), 900 dr. from 435 / 4 ( IG i³ 277 . v . 12 ) to 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . ii . 33 ) and 9 tal. again in 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 19 ). The reduction to 900 drachmas was presumably connected with the growing pressure of the Odrysians ( ATL iii. 310 -12 ). Selymbria joined the revolt of Perinthos (no. 678 ) by 410 , and members of the pro-Athenian faction were exiled ( Staatsverträge 207 . 12 = IG i³ 118 ; cf. Gehrke, Stasis 145 -46 ); the city refused to admit Alkibiades, but paid him money (Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 21 ). Selymbria was recaptured by Alkibiades in 408 ; the city was torn by stasis , and its fortifications betrayed to Alkibiades by the pro-Athenian faction; it was forced to pay indemnity, to accept an Athenian garrison (Plut. Alc . 30 . 2 -5 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 10 ; Diod. 13 . 66 . 4 ; Gehrke, Stasis 145 -46 ), and probably also to give hostages.The ensuing settlement in 408 ( IG i³ 118 ; ML 87 ) mentions guarantees (ll. 1 -31 ) of Selymbrian autonomy, restoration of hostages and political refugees ( Staatsverträge 207 . 12 ), cancellation of Athenian and allied claims to property lost in Selymbria except for real property (presumably indicating the existence of Athenian and allied landownership in Selymbria). The settlement was ratified in 407 by the Athenian ekklesia on the motion of Alkibiades (ll. 31 -47 ). A member of the Second Athenian Naval League since 377 ( IG ii² 43 B. 29 ), Selymbria joined the revolt of Byzantion in 357 (Dem. 15 . 26 ). According to the decree quoted at Dem. 18 . 77 , Selymbria was besieged by Philip in 340 . The decree is spurious, but the information it contains may be correct, and, like Perinthos and Byzantion, Selymbria must have been besieged by Philip II in 340 . The civic institutions of Selymbria are unattested, except for the probable mention of aisimnatai in a C4 inscription ( SGDI 3068 : [ αι ] σι µ νῶν [ τες ]; cf. Hanell ( 1934 ) 149 ) but are believed to have reproduced the pattern better known for other colonies of Megarian origin (Hanell ( 1934 ) 132 ff; cf. Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 142 -47 ). Arist. Oec . 1348 b mentions a law forbidding the export of corn in times of shortage. Apollo (Pythios), probably to be restored in line 28 of the agreement between Athens and Selymbria of 407 , seems to have been the protective deity of Selymbria, with public documents being published in his sanctuary ( IG i³ 118 . 26 -28 ; cf. Hanell ( 1934 ) 166 ; Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 104 -5 with reference to BCH 36 ( 1912 ) 558 , pace ML 87 ). Selymbria issued two series of silver coins: (a) from 492 / 0 to 473 / 0 and (b) from 425 / 0 to 411 / 10 , presumably on the Thrako-Makedonian standard and apparently for local use. Denominations: octobols down to hemiobols: obv . cock; rev . incuse square (a) or ear of corn (b). Legend: ΣΑ or ΣΑΛΥ (Head, HN ² 271 ; Schönert-Geiss ( 1975 ) 35 -49 ; SNG Cop. Thrace 789 -90 )."

Type: C: α ? The toponym is Σέρριον (Steph.Byz. 642 . 18 ) or Σέρριον τεῖχος (Aeschin. 3 . 82 ; Dem. 7 . 37 ) or Σέρρειον τεῖχος (Dem. 9 . 15 ; Harp. Σ 4 ). The city-ethnic is Σεριοτειχίτης ( IG i³ 283 . ii . 19 ). Serrion Teichos is not called a polis in any source, but polis status is indicated by its membership of the Delian League. The collective and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in the tribute lists ( infra ) and is restored in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 104 ). The identification of Serrion Teichos with Ganos ( ATL i. 545 ; Kahrstedt ( 1954 ) 21 followed by Barr .) is unconvincing (Isaac ( 1986 ) 211 ) and contradicted by the explicit distinction between the two sites in Aeschin. 3 . 82 followed by Harp. Γ 3 and Σ 4 ; see Ganos, supra 913 . Propontic Serrion Teichos is clearly to be distinguished from Serrion on the Aegean coast of Thrace ( supra 872 ). Serrion Teichos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists of 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 . ii . 19 ), 421 / 0 ( IG i³ 285 . ii . 87 ) and 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 18 ), contributing unknown sums. It was one of the fortresses conquered by Philip II in 346 (Aeschin. 3 . 82 ; Dem. 7 . 37 , 9 . 15 )."

The toponym is Τυρόδιζα , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 25 . 2 ; IG i³ 71 . iii . 108 ) or, once, Τυρόδιζαι ( IG i³ 261 . 4 . 30 ) or, once, Τυρόριζα (Hellan. fr. 62 ). The city-ethnic is Τυροδιζηνός (Krateros ( FGrHist 342 ) fr. 3 = IG i³ 100 ). The only source to call Tyrodiza a polis is Steph. Byz. 642 . 18 . According to Herodotos, it belonged to the Perinthians (no. 678 ) (Hdt. 7 . 25 : εις Τυρόδιζαν τηgraveν Περινθίων ), implying that it was a possession of Perinthos ( ATL i. 558 ); It could, however, mean 'a colony or foundation of the Perinthians' (see e.g. Thuc. 2 . 30 . 1 , 4 . 49 . 1 ). It is here considered to be a polis , at least in C5s, on the evidence of the Athenian tribute lists,where it is recorded among paying members of the League. Only the collective and external use of the city-ethnic is attested ( supra ). Tyrodiza is usually identified with Teiristasis, one of the Thracian teiche recorded by Ps.-Skylax 67 on the north-west shore of the Propontis, between the isthmus of the Chersonesos and Perinthos (cf. Dem. 12 . 3 ; schol. Dem. 12 . 1 . 1 ), which is plausibly identified with mediaeval Peristasis = modern Peristeri = present-day Sharkeui ( ATL i. 558 ; but see Isaac ( 1986 ) 203 -4 ). According to Steph. Byz. 642 . 18 , Tyrodiza was situated 'after' (i.e. east of) Serrion. Tyrodiza is recorded as one of the supply bases of Xerxes' army in 480 (Hdt 7 . 25 ). Tyrodiza was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded by toponym in the tribute lists of 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 30 ), 446 / 5 ( IG i³ 266 . i . 22 ) and 445 / 4 ( IG i³ 267 . i . 30 ), ## II.

The toponym is invariably Απολλωνία , -ίη , ηasper (Hdt. 4 . 90 . 2 , 93 . 1 ; Arist. Pol . 1306 a 9 ); ATL i. A 9 = IG i³ 71 . iv . 128 has been restored [ Απολ ] λονία . For supplementary precision ancient writers usually add ηasper εν τΩsubiotaῶ ( ΕυξείνΩsubiotaω ) ΠόντΩsubiotaω (e.g. Hdt. 4 . 90 . 2 ; Arist. Pol . 1306 a 9 ). The city-ethnic is Απολλωνιάτης (Arist. Pol . 1303 a 36 -37 and Aen. Tact. 20 . 4 , both adding εν τΩsubiotaῶ [ ΕυξείνΩsubiotaω ] ΠόντΩsubiotaω ). Apollonia is called a polis in the urban sense by Aen. Tact. 20 . 4 , and in Ps.-Skylax 67 it is the first toponym listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε . For the political sense, see Arist. Pol . 1303 a 26 and 36 -37 , where Apollonia is one of eight examples subsumed under the heading polis . Strabo 7 . 6 . 1 retrospectively describes it as άποικος and κτίσ µ α . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on C5s coins ( infra ) and externally at Aen. Tact. 20 . 4 and Arist. Pol . 1303 a 36 -37 (cf. the inscription from Pistiros (Vetren) SEG 43 486 . 32 (C4s)). The external and individual use is found in an inscription from Vetren ( IGBulg . iii . 1 1068 (C4 -C3 )) and in later documents. Apollonia is located at modern Sozopol (Bulgaria), partially on a peninsula (cf. Hind ( 1983 -84 ) fig. 3 ). The earliest archaeological finds are of C7l (ibid. 72 ; Panayotova ( 1998 ) 97 ; for the earliest finds in the cemetery, see T. Ivanov in I. Venedikov et al . ( 1963 ) nos. 780 -81 ; cf. for new material (Wild Goat style and related East Greek pottery) Reho ( 1986 )). The earliest stone inscription is C6 : IGBulg . i² 404 . For some rural settlements, see Hind ( 1992 -93 ) 85 . Apollonia was colonised by Miletos (no. 854 ) 50 years before the reign of Kyros (i.e. c. 610 ): Ps.-Skymnos 730 -33 ; cf. Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 85 -86 , Diller. The possibility that Rhodians joined the Milesians in founding Apollonia (Steph. Byz. 160 . 2 ) is to be rejected. According to Ael. VH 3 . 17 , the founder was Anaximander the philosopher, but Anaximander was 64 years old in Ol. 58 . 2 (i.e. 547 ; cf. Diog. Laert. 2 . 2 ), so he was born c. 611 and he can hardly have been the oikistes of Apollonia if we accept the traditional dating (strongly supported by the archaeological evidence). Steph. Byz. 96 . 2 -4 also mentions Αacuteνθεια καιgrave τουtilde Πόντου πόλις προgraveς τηsubiotaηtilde ΘρΩsubiotaάκηsubiotaη , Μιλησίων καιgrave Φωκαέων άποικος , ηaspertildeς µ έ µ νηνται πολλοιgrave καιgrave Φιλέας (cf. Plin. HN 4 . 11 . 45 : Astice regio habuit oppidum Anthium; nunc est Apollonia ). It might have been a minor Milesian foundation identified with a settlement on the Atiya peninsula (Antheia &gt; Atiya) which produced early Greek material (Hind ( 1983 -84 ) 73 ). See also the astakos (crayfish) symbol on C5m-C4 coins of Apollonia, which may be a pun on the region, Astike (Hind ( 1985 a )). Apollonia was a member of the Delian League; at least, it was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iv . 128 ). Athenian influence is attested in the calendar, which includes the specifically Athenian month Mounychion ( IGBulg . i² 469 bis ), dated C3 -C2 but perhaps introduced in C5 (Trümpy, Monat . 91 ). In 341 Apollonia had a treaty with Philip II of Makedon (Just. Epit . 9 . 2 . 1 ), perhaps in a subordinate position, and in 313 it probably joined the alliance with Kallatis (no. 686 ), Istros (no. 685 ) and other west Pontic cities against Lysimachos (Diod. 19 . 73 ). Apollonia originally (C6 ) had an oligarchic constitution; cf. Arist. Pol . 1305 b 39 -1306 a 6 -9 , where a stasis is mentioned in a discussion of how oligarchies change. At Pol . 1303 a 36 -38 Aristotle mentions that'the people of Apollonia on the Euxine Sea after bringing in additional settlers ( εποίκους ) fell into faction ( εστασίασαν )' . These references probably refer to two different moments: the affair of the epoikoi suggests an Archaic context, close to the foundation, while the change in oligarchy seems to indicate rather elaborate institutions (Danov ( 1976 ) 210 ; Gehrke, Stasis 24 , 255 ). Anextra-urban sanctuary of Apollo Ietros on St Cyriacus (Svet Kirik) island (known from Heltic inscriptions) is indirectly attested for C5 , in so far as the statue of Apollo captured in 72 by the Romans (Plin. HN 4 . 13 , 34 . 7 ; App. Ill . 30 ) was a work of Kalamis (Strabo 7 . 6 . 1 ), whose activity falls c. 475 -450 . The sanctuary is surely as old as the city itself. In C5 -C4 a megaron of Ge Chthonia is also mentioned ( IGBulg . i² 398 ). Other attested cults are those of Artemis Pytheia of Milesian origin (graffito in SEG 3 557 (C6 )) and Aphrodite (Archaic terracottas; cf. Hoddinott ( 1975 ) 38 ). Aen. Tact. 20 . 4 refers to pylai at Apollonia in C4m and thus to the existence of fortification walls. The two harbours are attested only in the Heltic period. Apollonia struck silver coins on the Attic standard from C5m onwards. Denominations: tetradrachm, drachm, diobol and fractions of obol. ( 1 ) C5s: type: obv . anchor (and crayfish l. or r.); legend: Α or ΑΠΟΛΛΩΝ ; rev . swastika in incuse or Gorgoneion in concave field. ( 2 ) C4 : obv . head of Apollo laur.; rev . anchor (and crayfish l. or r.); legend: Α and magistrate's name (Head, HN ² 277 -78 ; Price ( 1993 ) pl. VI nos. 148 -63 ; Zaginajlo ( 1974 ) 49 -50 for the weight standards). Before the coinage of silver drachms Apollonia seems to have struck bronze arrowhead money (Balabanov ( 1986 ); Preda ( 1991 ))."
683,Bizone (Bizonites),The Black Sea Area,43.25,28.2,364,1883,"683 . Bizone (Bizonites) Map 22 . Lat. 43 . 25 , long. 28 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: C: α . The toponym is Βιζώνη , ηasper ( I.Histriae 15 . 26 (C3l); Ps.-Skymnos fr. 3 , Marcotte). In its only occurrence the city-ethnic is Βιζωνίτης ( I.Iasos 408 (post 167 )); the forms recorded by Steph. Byz. 169 . 15 -16 ( Βιζωναῖος or Βιζώνιος ) are not attested elsewhere. A possible further mention rC4 depends on acceptance of the conjecture suggested by Iliescu ( 1969 ), ( 1971 ) apud Clem.Al. Strom . 5 . 5 p. 240 : Βιζωνιτῶν δή µ Ωsubiotaω instead of Βυζαντίων δή µ Ωsubiotaω ( contra Pippidi ( 1984 ) 153 n. 12 ). Bizone is called a polichnion by Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 75 = Ps.-Skymnos fr. 3 . However, it was a C6 colony ( infra ) and presumably founded as a polis . The territory of Bizone is called chora in an external inscription (Istros: I.Histriae 15 . 26 (C3l)). In the neighbouring area µ ιγάδες /asperacuteΕλληνες are attested (Ps.-Skymnos fr. 2 b, Marcotte), i.e. Greeks, (Thracian) Krobyzians and Skythians. The city was destroyed by an earthquake (Strabo 1 . 3 . 10 , 7 . 6 . 1 ; Pompon. 2 . 2 . 22 ; Plin. HN 4 . 11 . 44 ) in C1s and then refounded in the Imperial period. Bizone is located at modern Kavarna (Bulgaria), Chirakman promontory.A few archaeological remains date to the beginning of C6 (East Greek banded ware: Salkin ( 1986 )), but the bulk of the pottery is of late C5 to C3 (Hind ( 1992 -93 ) 87 ). Hence, Bizone was colonised possibly in C6 . Although Ps.-Skymnos fr. 3 knew a tradition that it was founded by a barbarian people,whereas according to another it was a colony of Mesambria (no. 687 ), both traditions are suspect: the Greek character of the city is beyond doubt, but the few later inscriptions do not confirm that the city was Dorian. Rather, Bizone was founded by Miletos (no. 854 ) or by one of the west Pontic Milesian colonies."
684,Dionysopolis (Dionysopolites),The Black Sea Area,43.25,28.1,463,2447,"684 . Dionysopolis (Dionysopolites) Map 22 . Lat. 43 . 25 , long. 28 . 10 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: B: α . The toponym is ∆ιονυσόπολις , ηasper (Ps.-Skymnos fr. 2 , Marcotte), ∆ιονυacuteσου πόλις (Steph.Byz. 233 . 1 ). According to the ancient tradition, the original name was Κρουνοί , which was changed to Dionysopolis after the discovery of a statue of Dionysos in the sea (Ps.-Skymnos fr. 2 b, Marcotte; Steph. Byz. 233 . 3 -5 ). Strabo 7 . 6 . 1 still uses Krounoi, and not Dionysopolis. The city-ethnic is ∆ιονυσοπολίτης ( I.Kallatis 14 (C3 ) and Heltic coins (Head, HN ² 274 : ∆ΙΟΝΥΣΟΠΟΛΙΤΩΝ )). Dionysopolis is implicitly called a polis in all the sources, in so far as polis is part of the composite toponym, but none is pre-Heltic; Heltic inscriptions give some polis cognates: politai ( IGBulg. i² 13 ter (C3 )) and politeia in proxeny decrees ( infra , C3 ). The earliest attestations of the city-ethnic are Heltic ( IGBulg . i² 13 bis (C3 if not C4l); I.Kallatis 14 (C3 )). Dionysopolis is located at modern Balchik; no archaeological remains are pre-Roman (Hind ( 1983 -84 ) 74 ), but the earliest inscriptions are C4 ( IGBulg . i² 19 bis , 25 -27 ). Dionysopolis was possibly colonised by Miletos (no. 854 ), perhaps not directly, but the metropolis is never mentioned (cf. Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 65 -66 ; Avram ( 1996 ) 294 , 298 -99 ). The probable existence of the Ionian phylai points to a C6l-C5 date for the foundation; there is no proper foundation myth, but the tradition about the statue of Dionysos may suggest a refoundation in C4l. Grants of proxeny are attested only in C3 ( IGBulg. i² 13 bis , for a citizen of Odessos (no. 689 ), and 13 ter , for a citizen of Kallatis (no. 686 )). A citizen of Dionysopolis received proxeny from Kallatis: I.Kallatis 14 (C3 ). The seven phylai mentioned in IGBulg . i² 15 ter = 30 (Roman period) 'are probably identical with the seven phylai of Odessos, viz. the traditional sixfold Ionian division plus the later addition, the 'Romans' ' (Jones, POAG 276 ). The oldest attested public enactments are the two proxeny decrees of C3 ( IGBulg . i² 13 bis , which also mentions εγγείων έγκτησις , and 13 ter ). The eponymous magistrate was in the Heltic period the priest of Dionysos ( IGBulg . i² 22 (C2 )), but there is no evidence for the Classical period. The earliest mentions of the boule and of the assembly ( demos ) are from C3 ( IGBulg . i² 13 ter ) and C1m ( IGBulg . i² 13 )."
685,Istros (Istrianos),The Black Sea Area,44.35,28.45,1072,5459,"685 . Istros (Istrianos) Map 22 . Lat. 44 . 35 , long. 28 . 45 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A: α . The toponym is ' Ιστρίη (Hdt. 2 . 33 . 4 ) or /acuteΙστρος (Dubois ( 1996 ) 58 . 3 (C5f); Arist. Pol . 1305 b 5 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ιστριηνός (Hdt. 4 . 78 . 1 ) or ' Ιστριανός ( I.Olbia 7 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 19 ; Athens: SEG 24 258 ; IG ii² 8940 (all C4 )). It is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skymnos (fr. 6 , Marcotte, referring to the time of foundation) and in the political sense by Arist. Pol . 1305 b 5 -6 and, retrospectively, Diod. 19 . 73 . 2 (r 313 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ) and externally in Diod. 19 . 73 . 2 (r 313 ). The individual and external use is found in IG ii² 8940 ; SEG 24 258 (Athens); and I.Olbia 7 (all C4 ). Istros is called patra ( = patris ) in I.Histriae 171 (C4 ) (cf. CEG ii 882 ). Istros was founded by Miletos (no. 854 ) (Hdt. 2 . 33 ; Ps.Skymnos fr. 6 , Marcotte) in 657 (Euseb. Chron . 95 b) or some time later (Ps.-Skymnos fr. 6 ); archaeological evidence favours the earlier dating (Alexandrescu ( 1978 a ) 19 -21 , ( 1990 ) 50 -51 ). Istros itself founded ' Ιστριανῶν λι µ ήν north of the Dniester (Arr. Peripl. M. Eux . 20 ; Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 61 , Diller) and perhaps Nikonion (no. 688 ), in the same region. Orgame (no. 692 ) was probably also an Istrian foundation. Istros was perhaps a member of the Delian League, though there is no positive evidence. In 313 it was allied with Kallatis (no. 686 ) against Lysimachos (Diod. 19 . 73 . 2 -4 ). At the end of C4 an isopoliteia with Miletos (no. 854 ) is attested ( I.Histriae 62 ). The earliest proxeny decree is from C5l/C4e (Avram ( 1999 a )); a grant of proxeny to a citizen of Istros is found at Olbia (no. 690 ) in C4f ( I.Olbia 7 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 19 ). The evidence for civic subdivisions from the Late Heltic and Imperial period (four attested Milesian phylai ) undoubtedly indicates an earlier existence: Aigikoreis ( I.Histriae 333 (third century ad )); Argadeis ( I.Histriae 334 (third century ad )); Boreis ( I.Histriae 97 (C1 ), ? 191 (early first century ad )); Geleontes ( SEG 30 849 (Roman)). The original oligarchic constitution was replaced through a stasis by a democratic regime (Arist. Pol . 1305 b 1 -12 ), possibly as a consequence of Perikles' expedition in the Black Sea and the progress of Athenian influence (Plut. Per . 20 ; cf. Alexandrescu ( 1990 ) 70 -74 ). Several officials are attested in the Heltic period, but their Milesian origin indicates an earlier existence. The eponymous official was the priest of Apollo Ietros (implicitly I.Histriae 169 (C4e), 144 (C4 )), attested explicitly only from C1s ( I.Histriae 54 ) onwards. Istros is located near the village of Istria, Romania. The acropolis (with the temenos ), an Archaic city wall (C6s, destroyed at the end of C6 ) and a Classical city wall (C5 -C4 , possibly destroyed by Lysimachos in 313 ; cf. Diod. 19 . 73 . 4 ) have been identified through excavations. The early city walls enclosed an area of 60 ha distributed between the temenos on the acropolis and the civil settlement on the west side of the city (Alexandrescu ( 1978 b ), ( 1990 ) 51 -52 ; Dupont et al . ( 1999 )). Local inscriptions mention the agora (from C3f onwards: I.Histriae 1 , 3 , 8 , etc.). The sanctuary of Apollo Ietros is attested only from C3f onwards ( I.Histriae 6 , 65 , etc.), but it may originate in C6 . For the temple of Zeus Polieus with altar ( I.Histriae 8 (C3 )) and the temple of Aphrodite there is archaeological evidence from C6m (Pippidi ( 1962 ); Zimmermann ( 1981 ); Alexandrescu ( 1990 ) 56 -57 ). A theatre is mentioned in C3f ( I.Histriae 65 ). The main attested cults are those of Zeus Polieus ( I.Histriae 8 (C3 ), etc.), Apollo Ietros ( I.Histriae 169 (C4e), 314 A (C4 ), 104 , 144 (C4 -C3 ), etc.; cf. Apollo Φωλευτήριος I.Histriae 105 (C3 )); Leto ( I.Histriae 170 (C4 )); Aphrodite ( I.Histriae 101 (C6m), 108 (C4 ), 113 (C3 ), etc.). The festivals of Thargelia ( I.Histriae 65 (C3f)) and Taurea ( I.Histriae 60 (C2 ); cf. 61 (C2 )) are also attested in the Heltic period but they might be very old. The early Milesian calendar is suggested by the mention of the months Taureon ( I.Histriae 26 ; cf. the festival of Taurea), Thargelion (cf. the festival of Thargelia), Anthesterion ( I.Histriae 58 (C2 )) and Artemeision ( I.Histriae 54 (C1 )) (Trümpy, Monat . 89 ). Istros struck coins from c. 480 onwards. Its earliest coins are silver drachms; later denominations are trihemiobols and obols.Types: obv . two young heads tête-bêche,C5 issues with incuse square, C4 issues without; rev . sea-eagle on dolphin l.; legend: ΙΣΤΡΙΗ . C4 cast bronze coins have obv . wheel with four spokes; rev . ΙΣΤ (Head, HN ² 274 -75 ; Preda ( 1973 ) 19 -37 , ( 1975 ); Price ( 1993 ) pl. IX nos. 220 -58 ; SNG Cop. Thrace 191 -201 ). For different interpretations concerning the two opposite heads of the obverse of silver coins, see Hommel ( 1969 ) 261 -62 ; Hind ( 1970 ); Alekseev ( 1982 ); Karyshkovskij ( 1982 ); Hind ( 1992 -93 ) 90 and ( 1999 b ). About the weight standards of silver coins: Zaginajlo ( 1974 ) 51 -54 . Before the silver and bronze coinage Istros seems to have cast bronze arrowhead money (Preda ( 1991 ) 20 -27 ). That ΙΣΤΡΙΗ is an abbreviated form of the city-ethnic is indicated by the full form, ΙΣΤΡΙΗΝΩΝ , on late coins ( SNG Cop. Thrace 202 -4 , Suppl . 88 )."
686,Kallatis (Kallatianos),The Black Sea Area,43.5,28.35,1044,5386,"686 . Kallatis (Kallatianos) Map 22 . Lat. 43 . 50 , long. 28 . 35 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: [A]: α . The usual toponym is Κάλλατις , -ιν , -ιδος , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 67 ; Strabo 12 . 3 . 6 ; IOSPE i² 27 . 6 (C3 )), Κάλατις (Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 73 , Diller); Καλλατία also occurs (Diod. 20 . 112 . 2 (r 302 / 1 )). Pliny's isolated report ( HN 4 . 11 . 44 ) that Callatis antea uocabatur Cerbatis (MSS differ in this respect: Ceruatis, Aceruatis ) found a spectacular confirmation through the inscription IGBulg . v 5011 (Dionysopolis (early first century ad )); however, Καρβατις seems to be a river rather than a toponym (cf. Avram ( 1991 ) 106 ). The city-ethnic is Καλλατιανός (C4 coins, infra ; Arr. Anab . 6 . 23 . 5 (r 325 / 4 )) or Καλλαντιανός (Diod. 19 . 73 . 1 , 4 -6 , 20 . 25 . 1 , in all passages in the plural). In Ps.-Skylax 67 Kallatis is the fourth toponym listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε (cf. Diod. 19 . 73 . 5 (r 313 )); politai and politeia occur in proxeny decrees passim from C4l onwards. It is called αποικία by Ps.-Skymnos fr. 4 , Marcotte, and described as άποικος by Strabo 7 . 6 . 1 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ) and in C3 inscriptions ( SGDI 3089 = I.Kallatis 7 , etc.) and externally in Diod. 19 . 73 . 4 -6 (r 313 ). The individual and external use is found in Arr. Anab . 6 . 23 . 5 (r 325 / 4 ); I.Sinope 3 (Sinope (C4 )); and CIG 3317 = I.Smyrna 147 (C4 -C3 ). It is called patra ( = patris ) in CEG ii 731 = I.Kallatis 130 (C4 ). Kallatis was colonised by Herakleia (no. 715 ): Ps.Skymnos fr. 4 , Marcotte; cf. Strabo 7 . 6 . 1 ; Memnon ( FGrHist 434 ) fr. 13 ( 21 ), etc. Pompon. 2 . 2 . 22 ( Milesiis deducta Callatis ) must be a mistake. The dating depends on the identification of Amyntas (I or III), to whom the source of Ps.-Skymnos (Demetrios of Kallatis) refers. It is possible that Demetrios of Kallatis had Amyntas I ( c. 540 -498 ) in mind, so that Kallatis may have been founded at the end of C6 . But for this early dating there is no archaeological evidence (Hind ( 1992 -93 ) 89 ). Kallatis was probably a member of the Delian League, although in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 the attractive restoration Κά [ λλατις ] is not certain (Pippidi ( 1971 ) 63 -64 = SEG 22 9 versus Κα [ ρκινῖτις ] in IG i³ 71 . iv . 165 ). Around 313 Kallatis led a symmachia with Istros (no. 685 ) and other west Pontic cities against Lysimachos (Diod. 19 . 73 . 2 -4 ). After the conquest of Kallatis by Lysimachos, refugees from Kallatis were settled by the Bosporan king Eumelos in Ψόα : Diod. 20 . 25 . 1 . The first attested grant of proxeny is from c. 311 / 10 ( I.Kallatis 2 ), while the first known received proxeny is presumably by Sinope (no. 729 ) in C4 ( I.Sinope 3 , which is probably a grant of proxeny and other privileges,though the fragmentary text preserves only a grant of citizenship). The oldest attested public enactment is the proxeny decree from c. 311 / 10 , and the same inscription also records the boula . The eponymous official was, as in Megara (no. 225 ), the basileus , attested from C3 onwards: I.Kallatis 3 ; SGDI 3089 = I.Kallatis 7 , etc. The same inscriptions as well as I.Kallatis 4 mention probouloi for each month. The president of the assembly was the proaisymnon (pr(o)aisimnon) : Avram ( 1994 ) 170 -75 (from C3 onwards). More officials are mentioned in Heltic inscriptions. Kallatis is located at modern Mangalia (Romania). The earliest ceramic finds are C4e. Some public buildings attested through Heltic inscriptions could be older: a bouleuterion ( I.Kallatis 49 (C2 )), a prytaneion ( I.Kallatis 3 ; SGDI 3089 = I.Kallatis 7 (C3 )), a theatre ( I.Kallatis 3 (C3 )). The earliest city wall was erected in C4f (Preda ( 1968 ) 22 and recent unpublished excavations); its existence is also suggested by Diod. 19 . 73 and 20 . 25 . 1 (r 313 / 12 and 309 -307 ?), the two sieges under Lysimachos. The evidence for cults is mostly Heltic, but in some cases one may suspect an early Megarian origin. Attested patron deities are Zeus Polieus ( I.Kallatis 22 ), Zeus Soter ( I.Kallatis 254 (C4e)) and Athena Polias ( I.Kallatis 76 (C4 )). A typical communal cult of Megarian origin is that of Dionysos Patroos and Dasyllios, attested through a list of deities from C4 ( I.Kallatis 48 A). The same list also mentions Aphrodite Pandamos, Peitho, Kronos and (Damater) Chthonia. Among the attested festivals, the Dionysia ταgrave ξενικά ( I.Kallatis 3 (C3 )) may be of earlier origin. Eight attested months from the local calendar indicate a Megarian origin (Avram ( 1999 b ), complete restoration of the calendar). Evidence for oracle consultation is first given by Ps.Skymnos fr. 4 , referring to the foundation of Kallatis καταgrave χρησ µ όν (the oracle of Delphi), and by a series of oracular inscriptions from C4 -C2 ( I.Kallatis 48 -50 ). Kallatis struck silver coins from C4s onwards; the earliest coins are drachms and hemidrachms. Obv . head of young Herakles r.in lion skin; rev . corn-ear,club and bow-case; legend: ΚΑΛΛΑΤΙ or ΚΑΛΛΑ . Possibly also some types of bronze coinage (Pick ( 1898 ) nos. 196 -204 ; Head, HN ² 273 -74 ; Price ( 1993 ) pl. VII nos. 203 -4 ).

The toponym is Dorian Μεσ ( σ ) α µ βρία or Μετα µ βρία (derived from coin legend), Ionian Μεσα µ βρίη (Hdt. 4 . 93 , 6 . 33 . 2 ), koiné Μεση µ βρία (e.g. Ps.-Skylax 67 ); Μεσε µ βρία occurs only once ( IGBulg . i² 345 , a carmen epigraphicum ); cf. Velkov ( 1969 ) 27 -28 , with an exhaustive list of the attested forms.Of the corresponding city-ethnics, Μεσσα µ βριανός is found in IGBulg . i² 307 . 17 (C3f); ΜΕΤΑ on C5 coins is probably an abbreviation of Μετα µ βριανῶν , found unabridged on later coins; and Μεση µ βριανός is found in IOSPE i² 20 . 5 = Syll . ³ 219 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 15 (C4f). Mesambria is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 4 . 93 . 1 , and in Ps.-Skylax 67 Mesambria is the second toponym listed under the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε . Polis in the political sense is attested at Hdt. 6 . 33 . 2 , as well as in local inscriptions of C3f (e.g. IGBulg . i² 307 ). The cognates politai and politeia occur in the local proxeny decrees ( infra ). The city is also poetically called patris ( IGBulg . i² 345 ). It is described as άποικος by Strabo 7 . 6 . 1 and as κτίσ µ α by Eust. 803 ( GGM ii 356 -57 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally in abbreviated form on C5 coins ( supra ) and in inscriptions of C3 ( IGBulg . i² 307 , 309 , 317 ) and externally in Polyb. 25 . 2 . 14 and IGBulg . i² 388 bis (C2 ). The external individual use is found in IG ii² 9338 (C4m) and Syll . ³ 219 = IOSPE i² 20 (Olbia, C4f). Mesambria is located at modern Neseb˘ ar ('a classical peninsula site': Hind ( 1983 -84 ) 73 ). 'For the classical period, an estimate of the population of Mesambria has been made at 3 , 000 -4 , 000 inhabitants (of whom about 700 -800 might be hoplites), disposing of a city area of about 300 ha, and with a capability of launching up to 50 ships'(ibid. 74 ); but cf. Hind ( 1992 -93 ) 86 : 'revised estimates of the size of the ancient city suggest that to the present peninsula should be added areas to the north and the south now under water, giving an area of some 40 hectares' . Mesambria was colonised by Kalchedon (no. 743 ) and Megara(no. 225 ) at the time of Dareios'campaign against the Skythians ( c. 513 / 12 : Ps.-Skymnos 739 -42 , Diller; cf. Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 83 -84 , Diller) or by refugees from Kalchedon (no. 743 ) and Byzantion (no. 674 ): Hdt. 4 . 93 (Mesambria mentioned as toponym while relating the campaign of Dareios) and 6 . 33 (about its 'foundation' , which would fall in 493 ); cf. Eust. 803 ( GGM ii 356 -57 ). The first dating (C6l) is more likely to be correct (Ehrhardt ( 1987 ) 92 ; Avram ( 1996 ) 290 -92 ). Mena as κτίστης is recorded by the source of Strabo 7 . 6 . 1 in an attempt to explain the etymology of the name (cf. Plin. HN 4 . 11 . 45 ). See also the epigram IGBulg . i² 345 . 4 : Μεσε µ βρία ( sic ) δέ µ υ ( sic ) πατριgraveς αποgrave [ Μ ] έλσα καιgrave βρία , bria being the Thracian word for polis (Steph. Byz. 446 . 15 -16 , citing Nic. Dam.; Strabo 7 . 6 . 1 ; IGBulg . i² 345 comm.). Mesambria founded Naulochos (modern Obzor, north of Neseb˘ ar) at an unknown date: Strabo 7 . 6 . 1 : Μεση µ βριανῶν πολίχνιον (cf. 9 . 5 . 19 ; Plin. HN 4 . 11 . 45 ). Ps.Skymnos (fr. 3 , Marcotte) reports a tradition that Mesambria founded Bizone (no. 683 ), but since Bizone does not appear to be Dorian, the tradition is questionable. Mesambria probably joined the Delian League-at least, it was probably assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iv . 161 , where Μ [--] may refer to Mesambria). In C4 it had, perhaps as subordinate, treaties with some Thracian kings: IGBulg . i² 307 = v 5086 (rC3f). In 313 it was probably allied with Kallatis (no. 686 ), Istros (no. 685 ) and other west Pontic cities against Lysimachos (cf. Diod. 19 . 73 ). Citizens of Mesambria received proxenies from Olbia (no. 690 ) ( Syll . ³ 219 = IOSPE i² 20 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 15 ( c. 375 -350 )) and Oropos (no. 214 ) ( IG vii 281 = I.Oropos 50 (C3s)). The proxeny decree and the treaty concluded with the Thracian king Sadalas ( IGBulg . i² 307 (C3f)) are the earliest attested public enactments. The eponymous official was, as in Megara (no. 225 ), the basileus ( IGBulg . i² 322 bis (C3 )). Evidence for public architecture is also Heltic, but the theatre ( IGBulg . i² 307 , 308 bis , 308 ter (C3 )) and the sanctuaries of Apollo ( IGBulg . i² 307 , 307 bis , 308 bis (C3 ), etc.) and Dionysos ( IGBulg . i² 308 ter (C3 )) may be earlier than their first attestation. For the city walls (C5 or C4e) (pseudo-isodomic and isodomic work) there is only scanty archaeological evidence, since they were destroyed by the construction of the late Roman and Byzantine citadel (Velkov ( 1969 ) 31 -37 ). Some of the cults attested in Mesambria in the Heltic period are certainly or possibly of Megarian origin and so ought to be early: Zeus Hyperdexios ( IGBulg . i² 322 bis (C3 )) and Athena Soteira ( IGBulg . i² 326 (C1 )) as patron deities, Apollo ( supra , about his sanctuary), Dionysos (sanctuary: IGBulg . i² 308 ter (C3 ); Eleuthereus: IGBulg . i² 324 (C1 ); festival of the Dionysia: IGBulg . i² 307 , 308 bis , 308 ter (C3 )), (Damater) Malophoros ( IGBulg . i² 370 bis (Imperial period)), the Dioskouroi (festival of the Dioskouria: IGBulg . i² 308 septies (C3 )), etc. Mesambria struck coins from C5m onwards. The earliest coins are silver drachms. Types: obv . crested Corinthian helmet facing or head of Athena; rev . incuse square; legend: ΜΕΤΑ in a spoked wheel (Head, HN ² 278 -79 ; Price ( 1993 ) pl. X nos. 265 -71 ; Zaginajlo ( 1974 ) 50 -51 for the weight standards; Karayotov ( 1994 ) 18 -19 )."
688,Nikonion,The Black Sea Area,26.1,30.25,459,2395,"688 . Nikonion Map 23 . Lat. 26 . 10 , long. 30 . 25 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Νικώνιον , τό (Ps.Skylax 68 ) or Νικωνία , ηasper (Strabo 7 . 3 . 16 ) or Νικόνιον (Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 61 , Diller) or Νικώνεον (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1999 ) (C3f)). Apart from Steph. Byz. 476 . 2 there is no attestation of a city-ethnic. Nikonion is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 68 . That it was a polis in the political sense too is indicated by its registration in the Athenian assessment decree of 425 / 4 as a member of the Delian League ( IG i³ 71 . iv . 167 ). Nikonion was colonised in C6l directly by Miletos (no. 854 ) or, more probably, by Istros (no. 685 ); cf. the numismatic evidence and the role of Istros in refounding Nikonion (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1999 )). Nikonion was under the protectorate of the Skythian king Skyles (C5m, infra ) and then joined the Delian League; at least, it was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iv . 167 : Νικ [ ονία ] or rather Νικ [ όνεον ]; cf. Avram ( 1995 ) 197 ). C. 331 it was destroyed by Zopyrion (Y. G.Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 323 ) and then refounded (C3f) by Tyras (no. 694 ) with the support of Istros (Y. G.Vinogradov ( 1999 )). Nikonion is located at modern Roksolanskoye gorodishche (Ukraine), on the left bank of the estuary of the Dniester. The site had a defensive wall, uncovered in the north-western part of the upper terrace ( c. 475 -450 ). No inscriptions on stone have been found, while ceramic material (including graffiti) suggests the floruit of the site in C6l-C5 (Sekerskaya ( 1989 ); Zaginajlo and Sekerskaya ( 1997 )). Some of the minor settlements identified in the lower Dniester River region (Okhotnikov ( 1990 )) may belong to the territory of Nikonion. In C5f-m Nikonion cast bronze coins imitating the Olbian and Istrian coins. Obv . owl; legend: ΣΚ , ΣΚΥ or ΣΚΥΛ ; rev . wheel with four spokes. These coins were formerly attributed to Olbia (no. 690 ), but their concentration in the area at Roksolanskoye gorodishche suggests that they were issues of Nikonion (Zaginajlo and Karyshkovskij ( 1990 ); Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 35 , 209 ). On the other hand, their legend indicates that the Skythian king Skyles exercised a protectorate over Nikonion. In addition to its own issues, Nikonion regularly used Istrian silver and bronze coins (Karyshkovskij ( 1966 ); Preda ( 1973 ) 33 )."

The toponym is ' Οδησ ( σ ) ός , ηasper (Hippoc. Prorrheticon 1 . 72 . 3 ; Ps.-Skymnos fr. 1 , Marcotte; Diod. 19 . 73 . 3 , 20 . 112 . 2 ; IGBulg . i² 222 . 7 ), the Doric being ' Οδασός ( IG xii . 1 147 = GVI 1257 ( c. 200 )); or ' Οδησσόπολις (e.g. Ps.-Skylax 67 ). The city-ethnic is ' Οδησ ( σε ) ίτης (cf. IGBulg . i² pp. 79 -80 ; SEG 38 114 . v . 128 (C2s)) or ' Ωδασσίτα [ ς ] ( I.Rhod.Per . 267 (C4 )). In Ps.-Skylax 67 , Odessos ( ' Οδησσόπολις ) is the third toponym listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where polis is used in the urban sense; in the political sense, polis is used retrospectively by Diod. 19 . 73 . 3 (r 313 ). Strabo 7 . 6 . 1 describes it as άποικος . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on Heltic coins (Head, HN ² 276 ) and in C3 inscriptions, the earliest possible instance being IGBulg . i² 37 , restored (C3 ). The external individual use is attested by I.Rhod.Per. 267 ( ' Ωδασσίτα [ ς ] ( sic ) (C4 )); IOSPE ii 295 = CIRB 237 (Pantikapaion, C4l/C3e); IGBulg . i² 13 bis (Dionysopolis, C3 ). Odessos was colonised by Miletos (no. 854 ) at the time of Astyages' reign in Media (Ps.-Skymnos fr. 1 , Marcotte; c. 593 / 587 as the beginning of his reign); cf. Strabo 7 . 6 . 1 (Plin. HN 4 . 11 . 45 ). Scholars assume a date of c. 585 -570 (Hoddinott ( 1975 ) 49 ) or c. 560 (Danov ( 1976 ) 209 ). The earliest archaeological finds are from the second quarter of C6 : Toncheva ( 1967 ) 157 -60 ; cf. Hind ( 1983 -84 ) 74 . Despite the lack of positive evidence, Odessos is considered to have joined the Delian League (G. Mihailov, IGBulg . i² p. 80 ). About C4m it was subjected to the Getai; it was liberated in 341 by Philip II of Makedon and concluded a subordinate treaty with him (Jord. Get . 10 . 65 ; cf. Theopomp. fr. 217 ). In 313 it was allied with Kallatis (no. 686 ), Istros (no. 685 ) 'and the other neighbouring cities'against Lysimachos (Diod. 19 . 73 . 2 -3 ). The seven phylai mentioned explicitly in IGBulg . i² 47 bis (Roman period) have names which 'except for the later addition, Romaioi , presumably descended from the foundation in the sixth century' (Jones, POAG 275 ). The Milesian cult of Apollo is attested in C5 through a dedication (Hind ( 1983 -84 ) 74 ), and a marble head of the god (Hoddinott ( 1975 ) 51 and pl. 22 (C5f?)). Three attested months ( IGBulg . i² 39 : Artemision; 47 : Boedromion; 50 : Apatoureon) indicate the use of the Milesian calendar. Odessos is located at modern Varna (Bulgaria). There is no archaeological evidence for early city walls (but cf. Jord. Get . 10 . 65 for gates in the time of Philip II, and Diod. 19 . 73 . 3 for a poliorkia in 313 ) or urbanisation of Odessos. The city struck coins from C3l onwards; its earliest coins are gold staters and tetradrachms of Alexandrine or Lysimachian types (cf. Head, HN ² 276 -77 )."
690,Olbia (Olbiopolites) /Borysthenes (Borysthenites),The Black Sea Area,46.5,32.0,4016,19895,"690 . Olbia (Olbiopolites) /Borysthenes (Borysthenites) Map 23 . Lat. 46 . 50 , long. 32 . 00 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A: α . There are two toponyms: (a) Βορυσθένης and (b) ' Ολβία , ηasper (with variants); and two corresponding city-ethnics: (c) Βορυσθεν ( ε ) ίτης and (d) ' Ολβιοπολίτης . Their use depends on the date, the topographical meaning, internal versus external use, and on other criteria. (a) Borysthenes is found in SEG 36 693 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 90 ( c. 550 -525 ); SEG 48 1024 . 1 ( c. 530 -510 ); and Syll . ³ 218 . 1 (C4f): [ εις Βο ] ρυσσθένη εισπλεῖν At 4 . 24 . 1 Herodotos refers to Βορυσθένης ε µ πόριον (cf. Βορυσθενεϊτέων ε µ πόριον at 4 . 17 . 1 ); at 4 . 78 . 5 he has εν Βορυσθένεϊ , and the context suggests that the reference is to the city in the urban sense (cf. Βορυσθενεϊτέων άστυ at 4 . 78 . 3 , and οιasper εν Βορυσθενεϊτέων τηsubiotaηtilde πόλι at 4 . 79 . 2 ). (b) Olbia . ΟΛΒΙΗ is found on C4e coins ( infra ), in IOSPE i² 164 (C5f: ' Ολ [ βίης ], restored Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1989 ) 111 n. 124 ) and seems to be an abbreviation of the full form ' Ολβίη πόλις attested in inscriptions from the city itself (Rusyaeva ( 1986 ) 26 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 93 (C6s); DGE 735 . 2 , 24 ( c. 330 )); ' Ολβία is found in DGE 735 . 15 ; ' Ολβιόπολις is found in IOSPE i² 325 ( c. 330 -320 , restored Y. G.Vinogradov ( 1989 ) 165 ). (c) Borysthen(e)ites is found in Hdt. (e.g.) 4 . 17 . 1 , 4 . 54 , 4 . 78 . 3 , 4 . 79 . 2 , 4 , and CEG ii 723 = SEG 39 568 (C4 ) (Amphipolis, individual use). (d) Olbiopolites is found in Hdt. 4 . 18 . 1 ; IOSPE i² 20 . 2 (C5l/C4e), 21 . 2 (C4 ); and ΟΛΒΙΟ (-) occurs on coins from C4f onwards. It is generally assumed that the first Greek (surely Milesian) settlement (C7m) was on the island of Berezan ( infra ), that the beginning of the site on the mainland dates to c. 600 or some time later, and that the latter included Berezan in the community later known basically as Olbia. Some scholars assume that the emporion and the polis ( asty ), originally called Βορυσθένης , were identical, while some others distinguish between the asty and the emporion . The latter differ in more points. Some of them distinguish between Βορυσθενεϊτέων ε µ πόριον and Βορυσθένης ε µ πόριον , at Hdt. 4 . 17 . 1 ( emporion belonging to the community of the citizens called Borysthenitai ) versus Hdt. 4 . 21 . 1 ( emporion as a city with flourishing trade activities) (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 133 -45 ), while others assume that both records indicate a section of the city (e.g. Hind ( 1985 b ) 105 -9 , ( 1995 -96 ) 116 , ( 1997 ) 107 -11 ). On the other hand, even if one accepts that the emporion was (at least in Herodotos' time) only a part of the city (for this particular meaning of emporion , see Hansen ( 1997 c ) 86 -87 , 100 -1 ), views differ on the question of its location: the earliest settlement at Berezan (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 133 -45 ) or the harbour of the 'lower town' (Hind ( 1997 ) 111 ; Hansen ( 1997 c ) 102 ). The toponym Βορυσθένης occurs on a bone chip with a graffito (Dubois ( 1996 ) 90 (C6m)) found at Berezan which may support the equation Berezan = Borysthenes . None the less, the fine distinction between Borysthenes and Olbia remains subject to dispute. Quasi equivalence is suggested by the local coin law from C4f: Syll . ³ 218 . 1 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 14 line 1 : [ Βο ] ρυσσθένης and 15 -16 : τοgrave αργυacuteριο [ ν τοgrave ] ' Ολβιοπολιτικόν . Further testimony is given (retrospectively) by Strabo 7 . 3 . 17 ; cf. Steph. Byz. 176 . 14 -16 . Ps.-Skymnos fr. 10 , Marcotte, seems to have contaminated more sources, and is rather puzzling; cf. Dubois ( 1996 ) p. 3 . It has also been assumed that after the mainland community absorbed Berezan, the inhabitants called themselves Olbiopolitai and their city Olbia , while Borysthenes and Borysthenitai were used by non-native Greeks (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 143 ). This might have been true in C5 (no external inscriptions), but at least from C4 onwards it is not only Βορυσθενίτης (e.g. CEG ii 723 ; cf. Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 31 , Amphipolis; IG ii² 8423 , Athens; F.Delphes iii . 3 207 . 4 (C3f); Maiuri, Nuova silloge 95 , Rhodos (Hell.)) which occurs, but also [ ' Ολ ] βιοπολίτας ( IOSPE i² 345 , Chersonesos (C4l); cf. Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 491 ), ' Ολβιοπολῖται ( SovArch ( 1960 ) 4 , 173 -79 , Tyras (C3f)), ' Ολ [ β ] ιοπολίτης ( I.Kallatis 166 (C2 )), ' Ολβία ( I.Tomis 5 (C2l)), etc., and not only in inscriptions from Pontic cities, whose vicinity could suggest the influence of the internal use, but also in Asia Minor (Klaros: ' Ολβιοπολειτῶν τῶν καιgrave Βωροσθενειτῶν ( sic ); Robert ( 1980 ) 85 ). The restored [ ' Ολβιανοgraveς τῶν προgraveς ] /asperacuteΥπανιν ( I.Kalchedon 4 . 13 ) is in many respects suspect; ' Ολβιοπολίτης should be expected (Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 355 n. 591 ). Olbia is called a polis both in the urban sense (Dubois ( 1996 ) 23 . 12 (C6s); Hdt. 4 . 79 . 2 ; SEG 42 711 (C4s)) and in the political sense (Dubois ( 1996 ) 14 . 15 (C4f) = Syll . ³ 218 ; SEG 32 794 . 3 (C4s)). A C6l graffito: πόλεως , may be an example of the political use as well ( SEG 42 719 ). The territorial sense is presumably a connotation in a C5f funerary epigram ( IOSPE i² 270 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 44 . 1 = CEG i 173 ). Politeia occurs in proxeny decrees ( infra ); polietai is found in SEG 31 701 (C5m). The άστυ and the προάστειον ('Vorstadt') are mentioned at Hdt. 4 . 78 . 3 . Strabo 7 . 3 . 17 describes the former as a κτίσ µ α (for the problem of the ε µ πόριον , supra ). [ πάτρ ] α has been restored in SEG 39 568 (C4 ), and patris is found in SEG 46 949 (cf. SEG 31 702 ; CEG ii 884 ; see Lebedev ( 1996 ) and Raaflaub ( 2000 ) 261 -65 ). Olbia (Borysthenes) is called an asty by Hdt. 4 . 78 . 3 . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested in SEG 31 701 (C5m) and in several decrees of C4 (e.g. IOSPE i² 20 ; I.Olbia 3 , 4 , 9 ) and is abbreviated ΟΛΒΙΟ (-) on C5l coins ( infra ); it is also found in an isopoliteia between the city and Miletos (no. 854 ) ( Staatsverträge 408 ). The internal individual use is found in Dubois ( 1996 ) nos. 58 . 4 (C5f) and 49 . 2 (C4f). (For the external individual and collective use of the city-ethnic, see the discussion of Olbiopolitai / Borysthenitai above.) Olbia is located at modern Parutino, in the confluence area of the rivers Bug (Hypanis) and Dnieper (Borysthenes). Some 38 km south-west from Parutino and 2 km from the mainland is situated the island of Berezan, a former peninsula jutting south at Viktorovka (near Ochakov). It is assumed that it became an island after the first Greek settlement (Solovyov ( 1999 ) 1 -113 ). The earliest among the more than 100 rural settlements around Olbia that have been surveyed produced archaeological materials from C6f. A large chora bordering basically on the right bank of the river Bug is attested in C6 (Kryzhitskij et al . ( 1989 )). It was laid waste by the Skythians in C5e and then repopulated from C4e to C3m (Ruban ( 1985 ) 30 -36 ). Olbia was founded by Miletos (no. 854 ) (Hdt. 4 . 78 . 3 ; Ps.Skymnos 813 -14 , Diller; Steph. Byz. 176 . 15 ). The foundation year ( 647 / 6 ) given by Euseb. Chron . 95 b surely refers to Berezan, where the earliest archaeological materials are from C7s (a few sherds are from the second quarter of C7 : Kopejkina ( 1973 )). The earliest finds in Olbia are from C6e (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 377 -84 ), with the exception of two sherds of C7s (Kopejkina ( 1976 ) 138 -39 ; Rusyaeva ( 1986 ) 42 and n. 85 ). This would correspond to the synchronism suggested by Ps.-Skymnos with the 'power of the Medians' , so Olbia may have been founded c. 600 (Kopejkina ( 1976 ) 139 ; Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 383 ) or some time later (Kryzhitskij ( 1985 ) 57 ). Epoikoi from the metropolis and inhabitants from Berezan installed the new centre on the mainland (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1989 ) 33 -39 ; Y. G. Vinogradov et al . ( 1990 ); cf. Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 74 -78 ). It is assumed that Olbia joined the Delian League after 437 (Karyshkovskij ( 1959 ); Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1989 ) 126 -34 ; contra Brashinskij ( 1963 ) 70 -85 ). It had c. 389 -380 a homologia with the Bosporan king Leukon I ( 389 / 8 -349 / 8 ) (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 515 -25 ). An isopoliteia with the metropolis Miletos is attested through Syll . ³ 286 = Staatsverträge 408 ( c. 329 ). In C4 proxenies were granted by Olbia to citizens from Tauric Chersonesos (no. 695 ) ( I.Olbia 3 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 15 (C4e)), Arkadian Orchomenos (no. 286 ) ( I.Olbia 4 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 17 (C4e)), Mesambria (no. 687 ) ( Syll . ³ 219 = IOSPE i ² 20 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 15 ( c. 375 -350 )), Istros (no. 685 ) ( I.Olbia 7 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 19 (C4f)), Herakleia (no. 715 ) ( I.Olbia 6 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 20 ( c. 340 -330 )), Byzantion (no. 674 ) ( I.Olbia 9 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 18 ( c. 340 -330 )), Athens (no. 361 ) ( I.Olbia 5 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 21 ( c. 340 -330 ); cf. Y . G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 484 -92 ), ?The[bes] or ?The[ssaly] ( I.Olbia 14 ; cf. Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 31 (C4 )). Received proxenies occur only from C4l onwards: IOSPE i² 345 (Chersonesos) (cf.Y. G.Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 491 n. 38 ). A grant of citizenship is attested early through a [dogm]a for the previous tyrant of Sinope (no. 729 ) and his brother who fled to Olbia in 437 (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 165 -94 = SEG 31 701 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 5 ), later through a public decision for Satyros I ( 433 / 2 -389 / 8 ), archon of Bosporos (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 515 -25 ( c. 392 -389 )). In 331 , when the city was besieged by Zopyrion, citizenship was granted to foreign residents (Macrob. Sat . 1 . 11 . 33 : dataque ciuitate peregrinis ; cf. Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 276 -322 = Y. G.Vinogradov ( 1989 ) 153 -63 ; SEG 32 794 ). It is assumed that the original aristocratic constitution (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1989 ) 69 -80 ) was replaced c. 480 by a tyranny (ibid. 109 -26 ); cf. the name of a certain Paus(anias) on coins and the aisymnetes of the Molpoi . Hdt. 4 . 78 -80 and the numismatic evidence suggest that in C5m a kind of protectorate over Olbia was exercised by the Skythian king Skyles (Y.G.Vinogradov ( 1989 ) 90 -109 ), as in Nikonion (no. 688 ) or Karkinitis (no. 698 ) ( SEG 40 625 ; cf. BE ( 1989 ) 478 , ( 1990 ) 566 ). In C4e the tyranny and the Skythian protectorate had been abolished (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1989 ) 135 -50 , ( 1997 ) 229 ). Some numismatic evidence and the emergence of a new formula in the local decrees indicate the rise of a moderate democratic constitution (Y.G.Vinogradov ( 1989 ) 146 -50 ); more democratic reforms (naturalisation of foreign residents,abolition of debts,etc.) were accomplished in 331 (Macrob. Sat . 1 . 11 . 33 ; SEG 32 794 ; supra ). The earliest public enactments are revealed by some graffiti with ΠΟ , ΠΟΛΕ , ΠΟΛΕΩΣ (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1989 ) 62 -63 and fig. 4 (C6l/C5e); cf. SEG 42 719 ). The earliest decree is a grant of ateleia to a Sinopean ( I.Olbia 1 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 1 (C5f)), followed by the grant of citizenship, ateleia and enktesis ges kai oikies to the previous tyrant of Sinope and his brother ( supra ), and by the grant of citizenship and ateleia to Satyros I ( 433 / 2 -389 / 8 ), archon of Bosporos (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 515 -25 ( c. 392 -389 )). A possible grant of ateleia seems to be attested through I.Olbia 2 A (cf.Y. G.Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 188 n. 86 (C5s)). Through the isopoliteia from c. 329 ( Syll . ³ 286 = Staatsverträge 408 ), ateleia was also granted to Milesians. The original eponymous magistrate was the aisymnetes of the Molpoi ( I.Olbia 58 restored by Graf ( 1974 ) 210 ) and, from C4 onwards,the priest of Apollo Delphinios (Karyshkovskij ( 1978 )). The council ( boule ) and the assembly ( demos ) are attested from C4f onwards (Dubois ( 1996 ) 14 . 2 -3 ; IOSPE i² 26 ; IOSPE i² 325 ; SEG 32 794 ). Other officials are the agoranomoi (Y. G. Vinogradov and Kryzhitskij ( 1995 ) 92 , from C5 onwards) and the commission of five τειχοποῖαι ( SEG 32 795 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 13 (C4m)). There is a rich epigraphical and archaeological documentation for Olbian patron deities, especially for Apollo. Apollo Delphinios (first dedications from C5m onwards: I.Olbia 55 -59 ), whose sanctuary was the central temenos , became the main deity from C6l onwards. His cult was observed by the Molpoi (whose aisymnetes was the eponymous official: SEG 28 647 ; see also I.Olbia 55 , 56 , 167 ) and the Numeniastai (Dubois ( 1996 ) 96 ). Apollo Ietros (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 80 ; Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 145 -46 ; but cf. Ehrhardt ( 1989 )), whose sanctuary was the western temenos (see especially the kalypter with the graffito ΙΗΤΡΟΟΝ : Rusyaeva ( 1986 ) 45 fig. 4 . 7 , 3 . 6 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 59 (C6s)), is attested through graffiti from C6f onwards ( LSAG ² 416 pl. 72 no. 61 ; Graf ( 1974 ); Rusyaeva ( 1986 )). The earliest dedications are from C5f ( IOSPE i² 164 (cf. SEG 28 657 ); Rusyaeva ( 1992 ) 35 fig. 9 ; I.Olbia 167 , restored). A graffito on a skyphos (Y. G. Vinogradov and Rusyaeva ( 1980 ) 25 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 99 (C5m)) mentions Apollo Delphinios, Ietros, Thargelios and Lykeios. Artemis is attested as Delphinia (Y. G. Vinogradov and Rusyaeva ( 1980 ) 29 ), Pythia (Y. G.Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 78 ) and Ephesia ( SEG 32 741 ). Zeus and Athena are entemenioi theoi in the central temenos (Levi ( 1964 ) 141 ; see also the dedications to Athena and Zeus ( I.Olbia 64 (C6l/C5e), and 106 (C5s), restored by Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 374 ). Zeus, attested through graffiti from C6l onwards (Levi ( 1964 ) 151 , etc.), is later known as Eleutherios after the abolition of the tyranny (C4e) (cf. Y. G.Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 212 -15 ) and as Soter (Dubois ( 1996 ) 11 (C4l)), while Athena is represented on the earliest Olbian aes ( infra ). Notable among other communal cults is that of Dionysos Bakcheios, Bakchos and Iakchos (from C6l onwards: Rusyaeva ( 1979 ) 83 , ( 1992 ) 96 -100 ; Y ajlenko ( 1982 ) 290 no. 104 , etc.). Mysteries are recorded at Hdt. 4 . 78 -80 , while some bone chips (C5 ) attest the existence of Orphics (Rusyaeva ( 1978 ) = Dubois ( 1996 ) 94 ; cf. M. L. West ( 1982 ); Ehrhardt ( 1987 ) 116 -17 ; Zhmud ( 1992 ); Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 242 -49 ). Aphrodite Apatoura, Patroia, Syria is attested through graffiti (Yajlenko ( 1982 ) 288 -89 nos. 91 , 92 , 94 ; cf. Rusyaeva ( 1992 ) 100 -6 ) from C6l onwards.Graffiti from C5f and C4f mention άβατα (pl.!) of Aphrodite in the western temenos ( SEG 30 975 ; Dubois ( 1996 ) 71 a-b). Aphrodite and Hermes (attested through graffiti from C6 onwards (Tolstoj ( 1953 ) 24 , 44 ; SEG 30 878 , 909 ; cf. Hermes Patroios: Yajlenko ( 1982 ) 291 no. 110 ; priest of Hermes: SEG 34770 (C5e); oracle: SEG 34 771 (C5 ), etc.) were lords of the western temenos (Y. G. Vinogradov and Rusyaeva ( 1980 ) = SEG 30 972 -74 ). Other attested cults are those of Demeter and KorePersephone, Kybele, the Kabiroi, the Dioskouroi, Hekate, Themis (Y. G. Vinogradov and Kryzhitskij ( 1995 ) 114 -16 ) and Achilles (from C6 onwards: Rusyaeva ( 1992 ) 70 -83 ; Hommel ( 1980 ); Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 179 -80 ; Hedreen ( 1991 )), whose sanctuary was on the island of Leuke, protected by Olbia (cf. IOSPE i² 325 ). All twelve months of the Milesian calendar used in Olbia are named by a graffito on a skyphos (Y. G.Vinogradov and Rusyaeva ( 1980 ) 25 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 99 (C5m)). Early ties (C6s) with the oracle from Didyma are attested by a graffito from Berezan (Rusyaeva ( 1986 ) 26 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 93 ; Burkert ( 1990 )). The only attested communal dedication is to Zeus Soter (Dubois ( 1996 ) 11 (C4l)). Olbia is topographically distributed between two terraces: the upper town (acropolis) with the agora and the two temene divided by a street running north-south, including an area of c. 16 . 5 ha (Y. G. Vinogradov and Kryzhitskij ( 1995 ) 28 ); and the lower town (urbanised from C5f onwards) with a harbour (whose early existence is suggested by the privilege of είσπλους καιgrave έκπλους conceded by proxeny decrees from C5f onwards) which seems to be now under water. The early walls, towers and gates (cf. Hdt. 4 . 78 -79 ) have not been discovered; they were repaired through the five teichopoiai (Dubois ( 1996 ) 13 (C4m)). The first archaeologically attested walls ('Lehmziegelmauern') are those identified in the area of the Heltic West Gate, restored in C4l/C3e (Kryzhitskij ( 1985 ) 88 -93 ). In C5f the two parts of the city included an area of c. 44 -47 ha (Y. G. Vinogradov and Kryzhitskij ( 1995 ) 33 ). Early traces of urbanisation (C6s) are also attested on the island of Berezan. Public buildings are attested by both inscriptions and archaeological finds (cf. Y. G. Vinogradov and Kryzhitskij ( 1995 ) 27 -41 ): an ekklesiasterion (Dubois ( 1996 ) 14 . 9 -10 (C4m)), a dikasterion (rebuilt in C4l/C3e), a gymnasion (located south-west of the agora, c. 475 , then rebuilt in C4l/C3e), a theatre ( SEG 32 794 ; cf. Y . G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 390 n. 44 (C4 ); cf. TGR iii. 538 ), possibly also a hestiatorion (C6l, located on the place of the later gymnasion ; cf. Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1989 ) 62 ). The earliest archaeological evidence for the agora is of C6 . A 30 -35 m deep fountain has been excavated south of the gymnasion (Karasyov ( 1972 ) 40 -44 ), and several drains have been identified. Olbia had two temene : the central (or the eastern) temenos (from c. 530 onwards;cults of Apollo Delphinios,Athena and Zeus) containing the main altar and the temple in antis of Apollo Delphinios (Karasyov ( 1964 ) 49 -97 ; Pichikyan ( 1984 ) 178 -84 (C5e)),a treasure house (Kryzhitskij ( 1985 ) 64 -65 ) and some minor buildings; and the western temenos (from C6m onwards; cults of Apollo Ietros, later also Hermes, Aphrodite and Kybele; cf. Rusyaeva ( 1986 ), ( 1994 )) containing the temple of Apollo Ietros dating from C6l/C5e (Kryzhitskij ( 1997 )), more altars, possibly also a second temple. In the western temenos a stoa has been identified (Kryzhitskij ( 1985 ) 74 -75 ). The earliest Olbian coinage is represented by C6f bronze arrowhead money (Ruban ( 1982 )), C6s bronze dolphins (Zograph ( 1977 ) pl. XXX 1 -2 , 7 -11 ; Ruban ( 1982 )); add some bronze weights with signs of arrows and dolphins (Grakov ( 1971 )). In C5 the local mints produced not only bronze dolphins (Price ( 1993 ) pl. XIII nos. 359 -68 ), sometimes with legends: ΑΡΙΧΟ (Price ( 1993 ) pl. XIV nos. 374 -76 ) and ΘΥ (Price ( 1993 ) pl. XIII nos. 368 -73 ) but also cast aes of different standards: ( 1 ) obv . head of Athena in Attic helmet r., to l. dolphin; rev . wheel, in which, later, ΠΑΥΣ (the earliest ones: Price ( 1993 ) pl. XIV nos. 377 -78 ); ( 2 ) obv . Gorgoneion; rev . sea eagle flying r. on dolphin; legend: ΑΡΙΧ (Zograph ( 1977 ) pl. XXXI 1 ; Price ( 1993 ) pls. XIV-XVI nos. 379 -84 ); obv . Gorgoneion; rev . wheel; legend: ΑΡΙΧ (Zograph ( 1977 ) pl. XXXI 2 -3 ; Price ( 1993 ) pl. XVI nos. 385 -89 ); the small aes (C5l): obv . Gorgoneion; rev . sea eagle r. on dolphin; legend: ΟΛΒΙΗ (Price ( 1993 ) pl. XVIII nos. 394 -99 ). For a short time (C5l) Olbia also issued silver staters: obv . Herakles stringing bow r.; legend: ΕΜΙΝΑΚΟ ; rev . studded wheel; around, four dolphins (Anokhin ( 1989 ) 15 , 104 no. 11 ; Price ( 1993 ) pl. XIII no. 358 ). In C4f Olbia cast the heavy aes with obv . Demeter facing; rev . sea eagle l. or r. on dolphin; legend: ΟΛΒΙΗ (Price ( 1993 ) pls. XVII-XVIII nos. 390 -93 ) and also struck the first copper coins, later also silver and gold coins: obv . Demeter l.; rev . sea eagle flying l. on dolphin; legend: ΟΛΒΙΟ (Zograph ( 1977 ) pl. XXXII 2 -3 ). Foreign currency is also documented: by the coinage decree of Kanobos ( Syll . ³ 218 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 14 (C4m)) staters from Kyzikos (no. 747 ) must be exchanged for Olbian copper and silver coins (Y. G. Vinogradov and Karyshkovskij ( 1976 ) = Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 250 -75 ). SNG Cop.Thrace 66 -74 ."

The toponym is Το µ έοι (Ps.Skymnos fr. 5 , Marcotte) or Τό µ οι (Apollod. Bibl . 1 . 9 . 24 ) or Τό µ ις (Memnon ( FGrHist 434 ) fr. 13 ( 21 ); Strabo 7 . 6 . 1 ) or Το µ ευacuteς (Arr. Peripl. M. Eux . 24 . 2 ; Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 71 , Diller; I.Histriae 4 (C3m)). The city-ethnic is Το µ ( ε ) ίτης but it is not attested until C2 (e.g. I.Histriae 38 , 48 ); the plural city-ethnic Το µ έοι is attested at Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 72 , Diller. Tomis is called a polis in late sources only (Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 71 ; Steph. Byz. 628 . 6 ). Strabo 7 . 6 . 1 describes it as a polichnion , and it is called patris in the local inscription ( I.Tomis 2 (C2l)). Memnon ( FGrHist 434 ) fr. 13 ( 21 ) calls it an emporion (rC3m), and the same historian mentions (implicitly) the territory of Tomis as bordering on that of Kallatis (no. 686 ); however, the best evidence that it was a polis in the Classical period would be membership of the Delian League, but it is uncertain whether Τ [--] in IG i³ 71 . iv . 160 should be restored Τ [ ό µ οι ]. Tomis is located at modern Constan, ta (Romania), on a peninsula. It was colonised by Miletos (no. 854 ) (Ps.-Skymnos 764 , Diller), possibly through Istros (no. 685 )(Avram ( 1996 ) 297 -98 ); archaeological evidence points to a foundation in C6 . All the original Milesian phylai are mentioned, but, except for Argadeis ( I.Tomis 35 (C1e)), only in inscriptions from the Imperial period: Ai(gi)koreis ( I.Tomis 164 , 251 -53 ); Argadeis ( I.Tomis 52 , 179 ); Boreis ( I.Tomis 122 ); Geleontes ( I.Tomis 300 , 301 ); Oinopeis ( I.Tomis 255 , 375 ); Hopletes ( I.Tomis 123 , 254 ); cf. Doru, tiu Boil˘ a ( 1970 ); Jones, POAG 276 -78 . The earliest attested public enactments (C2l) are a sacred regulation ( I.Tomis 1 = LSCG 87 ) and a decree concerning the city defences ( I.Tomis 2 = Syll . ³ 731 ). Several officials are mentioned in the late Heltic period. The eponymous official was the priest of Apollo, first attested c. 100 ( I.Tomis 2 and 5 ) but surely of Milesian origin. All the evidence for deities is late, but Milesian origin is not in doubt for the cult of Apollo ( I.Tomis 2 and 5 ( c. 100 )). The calendar is surely Milesian, although only one month is attested: [ Απατου ] ρεῶνος or [ Ταυ ] ρεῶνος ( I.Tomis 1 b (C2l))."
694,Tyras (Tyranos),The Black Sea Area,46.1,30.2,783,3967,"694 . Tyras (Tyranos) Map 23 . Lat. 46 . 10 , long. 30 . 20 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: B: α . The toponym is Τυacuteρας , οasper (Ps.Skymnos fr. 9 , Marcotte; Steph. Byz. 642 . 4 -5 ). The cityethnic is Τυρανός ( I.Kallatis 10 (C3s); Alex. Polyh. ( FGrHist 273 ) fr. 138 ), attested on C4 coins ( infra ). Τυρῖται at Hdt. 4 . 51 could simply mean 'men of the river Tyras'and not 'citizens of the city of Tyras' . Tyras is called a polis only in late sources (Ps.-Skymnos fr. 9 ; Steph. Byz. 642 . 4 ; Ptol. 3 . 10 . 8 ), but its status as a polis in the Classical period is indicated by its presumed membership of the Delian League ( infra ) and by its C4m coinage ( infra ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C4m coins ( infra ). The external and individual use is found in SEG 30 923 (C3 ) and I.Kallatis 10 (C3s), and later. Tyras was colonised by Miletos (no. 854 ) (Ps.-Skymnos 799 -800 , Diller; cf. Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 62 , Diller). The foundation year is not known, but some archaeological finds (East Greek ware) suggest a date in C6 . Connected with the foundation is the problem of Ophiousa, a site first mentioned by Ps.-Skylax ( 68 : ' Οφιουtildeσα πόλις , listed under the heading πόλεις . . . ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε ), then by Strabo 7 . 3 . 16 (as a polis ), by Plin. HN 4 . 12 ( 26 ). 82 ( Tyra . . . ubi antea Ophiousa dicebatur ), by Ptol. Geog . 3 . 10 . 8 (toponym), and by Steph.Byz. 642 . 7 -8 ( Τυacuteρας . . . εκαλεῖτο δ ' ' Οφιουtildeσσα ). The name Ophious(s)a suggests that the settlement was of Milesian origin (cf. Teichiousa in Miletos' territory), but its location remains unknown. It has been tentatively located on an island at the mouth of the Dniester; if correct,it is possible that, as at Berezan/Olbia (cf. no. 690 ), the mainland community (Tyras) absorbed Ophiousa (Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 73 ), a suggestion which would explain the tradition that the name was at one point in use for Tyras itself (Steph. Byz.). The terminus ante quem of this synoecism depends on the date of the source of the C4 text of Ps.-Skylax. ' Ερ µ ώνακτος κώ µ η was probably a rural settlement in the χώρα (Strabo 7 . 3 . 16 ; Ptol. Geog . 3 . 10 . 7 ). Tyras joined the Delian League; at least, it was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iv . 163 : Τυacute [ ρας ] or, alternatively: Τυ [ ρανοί ]). The earliest public enactments are the honorific decrees Dacia 3 -4 ( 1927 -32 ) 566 -69 no. 2 (C4l-C3 ); SovArch ( 1960 ) 4 , 173 -79 (C3f) (cf. Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 220 n. 251 ); and Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1999 ) (C3f). The same inscriptions attest for the first time the boule and the assembly called demos . Among the deities mentioned in Heltic inscriptions, only Apollo Iatros ( Dacia 3 -4 ( 1927 -32 ) 564 -66 (C3 )) can be confidently assumed to be early (the patron deity). The three attested months (Kalamaion: Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1999 ) (C3f); Artemeision: IOSPE i² 2 ( ad 181 ); Leneon: IOSPE i² 4 ( ad201 )) suggest the original use of the Milesian calendar. Tyras is located at modern Belgorod Dnestrovskij (Turkish Akkerman, Romanian Cetatea Alb˘ a), Ukraine, c. 19 km up the estuary of the river Dniester ( Τυacuteρας ; Τυacuteρις (Ps.-Skylax 68 ) was perhaps the original form). The Archaic and Classical site was destroyed by the mediaeval citadel. There is very little evidence for the urbanisation of Tyras in C6 -C4 : excavations (Karyshkovskij and Klejman ( 1985 ); Samojlova ( 1988 )) have brought to light some remains of a defensive wall (C4 ), which was replaced in the Heltic period by a more extensive one. Tyras struck silver drachms from C4m onwards. Types: obv . head of Demeter facing, veiled and wearing wreath of corn-ears; rev . bull butting l.; legend: ΤΥΡΑΝ and ΤΥΡΑΝΩΝ ; also ΤΥΡΑ on struck bronze (Zograph ( 1977 ) 172 -73 ; Price ( 1993 ) pl.

The city was defined in various ways geographically: 'Chersonesos by Taurika' ( Χερσόνασος αasper ποτιgrave τΩsubiotaαtilde ΤαυρικΩsubiotaαtilde , IOSPE iv 71 , 72 ); 'Chersonasitai from the Pontos' ( Χερσονασῖται οιasper εκ τουtilde Πόντου , Syll . ³ 585 , 604 ); 'Chersonasitai in Skythia' ( τουgraveς εν ΣκυθίΩsubiotaα Χερσονασίτας , Memnon ( FGrHist 434 ) fr. 34 . 3 ). The earliest literary reference calls it emporion , not polis (Ps.-Skylax 68 ), leading to a suggestion that it was a trading settlement dependent on Herakleia (no. 715 ) during the first two generations of its existence (Kats ( 1990 )); but the siteclassifications of Ps.-Skylax in this part of his work are not to be trusted (see introduction).Moreover,the classification of Chersonesos as an emporion is fully compatible with its being a polis as well (Hansen ( 1997 c ) 87 -91 ). In the famous citizen's oath of C4l/C3e ( IOSPE i² 401 = Syll . ³ 360 ) Chersonesos is called a polis both in the urban sense (l. 3 ) and in the political sense (l. 6 ). The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested in the citizen's oath (ll. 4 -5 ) and (abbreviated as ΧΕΡ ) on coins ( infra ). For the external use, see CID ii 5 . i . 9 -10 ( 358 ). The individual use is attested externally in C4sepulchral inscriptions from Pantikapaion ( IOSPE ii 302 -3 = CIRB 194 -95 ). By C4m Chersonesos commanded a 'near territory' of 120 km ² on the 'Herakleian Peninsula' (the supposed isthmus being a line from Inkerman to Balaklava). The native Tauroi had been evicted from their settlements and incorporated in the city or on farms, or had been pushed out to a series of villages at its eastern edge along the Sapun Gora ridge (Savelya ( 1979 ); Shcheglov ( 1981 )). Some 'Kizyl-Koba' type pottery (Senatorov ( 1987 )) and crouched burials from the north-east part of the city and the north cemetery may represent this native element (Belov ( 1950 ); Saprykin ( 1998 ) 232 ), though some scholars argue that the latter were Greek (Kadeyev ( 1973 )). The lack of pre-colony (C5l) imported objects in Taurian settlements (Savelya ( 1979 ) 170 -71 ) suggested to those who studied them that no significant or long-lived trading settlement preceded the Herakleiot colony. By c. 350 approximately 11 , 000 ha of this home territory were parcelled out into 400 main lots, each having six subdivisions, producing 2 , 400 small allotments, mainly put to viticulture, fruit trees, etc. (Strzheletskij ( 1961 ) 14 -116 ; Y. G. Vinogradov and Shcheglov ( 1990 ) 312 -14 ; Saprykin ( 1997 ) 11 -105 ; Zherebtsov ( 1994 )). Some Chersonasitai seem to have settled and carried out burials in the Upper Quarantine Valley before this full exploitation of the Herakleian Peninsula (Strzheletskij ( 1948 a )). A recent suggestion is that the 4 , 000 ha along its northern coast were among the earliest allotments laid out (Nikolaenko ( 2001 )). By C4m-l Chersonesos also had a mini-empire in northwestern Crimea, including Karkinitis (no. 698 ), Kalos Limen and a series of forts ( ταgrave τείχη ) which may well have been detached from earlier Olbian influence (Y. G.Vinogradov and Shcheglov ( 1990 ) 311 -14 ). The sole specific account of the first foundation of Chersonesos is to be found in Ps.-Skymnos ( 822 -30 , Diller): Chersonesos was founded by Herakleia (no. 715 ) within the Euxine Sea along with Delians (no. 478 ) in accordance with an oracle, reasonably assumed to be that of Delphi. Some scholars have emended Delioi, repeated twice, to Delphians (no. 177 ) or Teians (no. 868 ), as the co-colonisers. A majority view emerged after the Second World War to accept the view of Schneiderwirth and Tyumenev that the Herakleiots and Delians may have collaborated in a colony, if only temporarily, in 424 -422 (Tyumenev ( 1938 ); Saprykin ( 1998 )). Most recently this consensus can be seen to be crumbling. Y. G. Vinogradov and Zolotaryov ( 1999 ) 118 -19 , 124 suggest a foundation by Herakleiots and Delians in 528 , the last year of Peisistratos'rule at Athens.By contrast,C5l or C4e is adhered to in another suggestion in which Delieis from Delion, the area of Boiotia from which some Herakleiots came (i.e. Tanagra (no. 220 )-coastal Boiotia) are proposed as the originals of the co-colonists, only later misunderstood by Ps.-Skymnos or his source (Hind ( 1998 ) 141 -48 ) for the better-known Delioi. In the citizen's oath Chersonesos is described as a democracy ( IOSPE i² 401 . 14 = Syll . ³ 360 ), and some forty-five inscribed ostraka from C5may attest to the institution of ostracism and a vigorous democracy throughout C5 ( BE ( 2000 ) no. 487 ). Magistrates attested are basileus ( IOSPE i² 186 -87 ); aisymnatai (Belov ( 1948 ) 69 ); damiorgoi ( IOSPE i² 402 , 424 , 429 ); nomophylakes ( IOSPE i² 351 , 359 ); astynomoi (Kats ( 1994 ) passim (C3e)); agoranomoi (ibid. 88 no. 16 (C3e); Monakhov ( 1999 ) 28 -29 ). The council had twentyfour members, and the citizen body was organised in hekatostyes . On the council were the magistrates, five archontes , a prodikos , a grammateus , a hiereus , three nomophylakes (Solomonik ( 1976 ); Saprykin ( 1991 ), ( 1994 ) 139 -42 ). The calendar was Megarian, similar to those at Byzantion (no. 674 ), Kalchedon (no. 743 ) and Kallatis (no. 686 ): Kadeyev ( 1996 ) 141 -48 ; Trümpy, Monat . 149 ; Avram ( 1999 b ). Proxeny decrees of C4 are rare, and they are from neighbour states to the west and the east of Chersonesos ( I.Olbia I. 3 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 16 (Olbia); IOSPE ii 302 -3 = CIRB 173 , 195 (Bosporos)). From Chersonesos itself comes a copy of a C4 Olbian decree for a Chersonesite ( IOSPE i² 21 ). The city's main deities-Zeus, Gê, Helios, Parthenos and the other Olympians-are mentioned in the preamble to the citizen's oath ( IOSPE i² 401 ). Dionysos and Herakles protected the end bastions of the isthmus wall of the 'old [Strabo's] Chersonesos'( infra ). The city stood for over 1 , 700 years down to the fourteenth century ad on a blunt headland,jutting north-eastward into Quarantine Bay, some 3 km west of Sebastopol. The earliest structural remains are of C5l/C4e, found in the north-east part of the later city over an area of some 12 ha, around which several cemetery areas were grouped to the southwest, the south and the south-east (Belov ( 1948 ) 155 ff, ( 1950 ) 272 ff, ( 1977 ); Zedgenidze and Savelya ( 1980 )). A stretch of the southern city wall has been found (Grinevich ( 1927 ), ( 1959 ) 115 -17 ). Red-figure pottery occurs from C4e, increasing in amount in C4m-l (Grinevich ( 1959 ); Zedgenidze ( 1978 )). Of C4 is the small Doric temple and possible altar (restored from fragments) once in the public square, with a statue base dedicated to Athena ( IOSPE i² 406 ; Zolotaryov and Bujskikh ( 1994 )). The mass of Classical material from Chersonesos (pottery, sculptural elements, building remains, burials and coins) has been determined as being of C4m-l, with a small amount of pottery being of C5s (Zedgenidze ( 1979 ), restated with further detail ( 1993 )). The significance of the relatively small amounts of C5material (red-figure vases, striped Ionic ware, Chiot and Samian trade amphoras, and black-glazed and other sherds, some forty-five with graffiti ostraka ) has still to be assessed as to amount,provenance and dating by pot form and lettering.It is not yet clear whether it represents a polis , or some lesser settlement in touch with the Tauroi before the Herakleiot colony. Zedgenidze ( 1993 ) has refuted in detail the view that the pottery and other evidence is sufficient for a polis of C5 on the Quarantine site (sectors VI and VII).Her view has not yet been acknowledged,still less answered by the supporters of a C6l/C5e Chersonesos (Y.G.Vinogradov and Zolotaryov ( 1990 ), ( 1999 )). A separate polis is mentioned by Strabo, 'the Old Chersonesos in Ruins' ( ηasper παλαιαgrave Χερρόνησος κατεσκα µµ ένη , 7 . 4 . 2 ). It lay 100 stades from the (Quarantine Bay) city, and nearby was Cape Parthenion with a temple of Parthenos, and an early statue ( xoanon ) of the goddess.The temple has disappeared,some placing it on Cape Fiolent to the west, others on the tip of Cape Chersonesos near the lighthouse. Excavations and surveys (in 1899 , 1903 , 1986 ) have proved the existence of a 'town'on the isthmus, defended by two parallel walls across it, some 900 m long and enclosing an area of 18 ha. The walls had interval towers, and towers at the ends, one dedicated to Herakles and the other having a small shrine to Dionysos. The peninsula itself leads off northwards to Mayachny (Lighthouse,also Fanari) Point,and comprises some 380 ha. These were divided into twenty-five major allotments, each subdivided into four, resulting in 100 plots on a different alignment, which is usually assumed to be earlier, from those on the larger 'peninsula' .All the small allotments were about 4 -4 . 5 ha in area. Nestling behind the double walls on the isthmus, they were protected on the landward side by fortification of some of the highest ground overlooking that peninsula to the east. This 'Old Chersonesos' , or 'Strabo's Chersonesos' , is 10 km west of the long-lived city on Quarantine Bay. It occupied some 18 ha on the isthmus of the only true Chersonesos (peninsula) in south-western Crimea; it was protected by the two parallel walls: in turn it guarded the 100 earliest allotments, and held the oldest cult statue of the polis . It is tempting to suggest that the isthmus site and land behind it (Mayachny Peninsula) was the earliest area of the Herakleiot colony (Hind ( 1998 ) 146 -52 ; Saprykin ( 1998 ) 242 -44 ; Y. G. Vinogradov and Zolotaryov ( 1999 ) 117 ), though other suggestions have been made that it was an early fort, subsidiary to the main city (Chtcheglov ( 1992 ) 228 ), or a protection for the ancient lighthouse (Nikolaenko ( 2001 )). A small amount of pottery (redfigured) of C5l/C4e and a relief sculpture depicting Herakles and the horses of Diomedes, from an altar of C4 , tend to confirm the early, if not primary, position of this isthmus settlement in the overall sequence of settlements (Blavatskij ( 1953 ) 26 -27 , 40 -44 ; Zedgenidze ( 1996 ); Strzheletskij ( 1948 b )). After a decade or two, when the Quarantine Bay polis was already established, it perhaps became a chorion or phrourion in the near territory of the city, perhaps that obscurely referred to as the saster in the citizen's oath (ll. 24 -25 ) as one of the places or institutions they vowed to protect (Hind ( 1996 a )). Chersonesos struck coins of silver and bronze from C4e, the silver on the Rhodian standard. ( 1 ) Silver: denominations: tetradrachm,drachm,triobol,diobol and obol.Types: obv . head of Parthenos l.; rev . fish and club; legend: ΧΕΡ below, representing the abbreviated city-ethnic. ( 2 ) Bronze: similar and with other types. Legend: ΧΕΡ . ( 3 ) Silver: didrachm: obv . Parthenos head l.; rev . bull butting l., club below; legend: ΧΕΡ . ( 4 ) Bronze: obv . Parthenos riding a four-horse chariot and holding a torch r.; rev . warrior armed with spear and oval shield, crouching l.; legend: ΧΕΡ below. This last issue is thought to celebrate a victory, leading to expansion in the north-western Crimea (Anokhin ( 1980 ) pl. 1 ff; Grandmezon ( 1982 ) 34 -36 , ( 1990 ); Price ( 1993 ) pls. XXVIII-IX)."
696,Gorgipp(e)ia (Gorgippeus),The Black Sea Area,44.55,37.2,963,5137,"696 . Gorgipp(e)ia (Gorgippeus) Map 84 . Lat. 44 . 55 , long. 37 . 20 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: B: β . Gorgippia was situated in the Asiatic part of the Kimmerian Bosporos (Strabo 11 . 2 . 10 ). The toponym is Γοργίππεια (Steph. Byz. 211 . 7 ), Γοργιππία (Strabo 11 . 2 . 10 ) or, earlier?, Σινδικοgraveς λι µ ήν (Ps.-Skylax 72 ; Ps.-Skymnos 888 ; Strabo 11 . 2 . 14 ), Σινδική (Arr. Peripl. M. Eux . 18 . 4 -19 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is Γοργιππευacuteς (C2 -C1 coins, infra ). At Ps.-Skylax 72 Σινδικοgraveς λι µ ήν is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις δεgrave ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where the term polis is used in the urban sense (cf. Strabo 11 . 2 . 14 ). The earliest explicit reference to a πόλις Γοργιππέων is in a letter of ad16 ( SovArch ( 1965 ) 197 A).The internal and collective sense of the city-ethnic ( ΓΟΡΓΙΠΠΕΩΝ ) is found on C2 -C1 coins (Price ( 1993 ) 986 ) and in an inscription of the first century ad ( CIRB 1118 ; Boltunova ( 1986 ) 46 -48 ). The location of Gorgippia and Sindike/Sindikos harbour is a matter of scholarly debate (latest discussion in Alekseeva ( 1991 ) 3 -7 ). They were situated in the territory inhabited by the indigenous population, the Sindoi (for the people, Σίνδοι , see CIRB 8 ; Hdt. 4 . 28 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 72 ; for the territory, ηasper Σινδική , see SEG 34 774 , restored; Hdt. 4 . 86 . 2 ; Strabo 11 . 2 . 12 ). Strabo's passage ( 11 . 2 . 10 ) about the location of Gorgippia provides grounds for different interpretations. Some scholars interpret Strabo's information to mean that Gorgippia was the capital of the Sindoi. The most widespread opinion is that Sindike/Sindikos harbour/Gorgippia were the same place, but with different names in use at different times. Sindike/Sindikos harbour was renamed Gorgippia some time in C4f, when the territory of the Sindoi was incorporated into the Bosporan Kingdom by Leukon I ( 389 / 8 -349 / 8 ) (latest discussion in Alekseeva ( 1997 ) 37 -82 ). The city was named after a member of the Spartokid dynasty, Gorgippos (ruling together with his brother Leukon I ( 389 / 8 -349 / 8 )), who was probably installed as a local governor of the city. This interpretation is supported by the 'royal' tiles of C4 , which carry the stamp: ΓΟΡ | ΓΙΠ | ΠΟΥ (Alekseeva ( 1997 ) 39 ). Sindike/Sindikos harbour was established by Greeks in C6 as a trading centre in the territory of the indigenous population,the Sindoi (Alekseeva ( 1991 ) 7 -27 , ( 1997 ) 11 -36 ). From C4e the city was part of the Bosporan Kingdom and dependent on Pantikapaion (no. 705 ) ( CIRB 6 , 6 a, 8 , etc.; Hind ( 1994 ) 484 -86 ; Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 66 , 68 -80 ). According to Ps.-Skymnos 887 -89 , Diller, it was settled by Greeks from the neighbouring places. A study of the rural settlements in the territory of Gorgippia is at an early stage.About fifteen settlements have been surveyed or partly excavated, mainly those of C4 . Very few date to the late Archaic period (Alekseeva ( 1991 ) 28 -50 ). Sindike and its successor Gorgippia are located beneath modern-day Anapa. The location of Gorgippia is firmly documented thanks to coins and inscriptions found in Anapa. It is possible that a settlement here had appeared even earlier (C7l). A fragment of a Rhodo-Ionian cup with bird decoration has been found at the Alekseevskoe settlement not far from Anapa (Kharaldina and Novichikhin ( 1996 ) 349 -50 fig. 2 ). Much firmer evidence is needed than one single fragment of pottery in order to postulate the existence of a C7l settlement (Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 42 n. 4 ). The first settlers lived in semi-dug-outs (Alekseeva ( 1991 ) 7 -27 , ( 1997 ) 11 -36 ). One funerary inscription of C5e shows the presence of a Peloponnesian from Helike (Boltunova ( 1986 ) 60 -61 ), thus suggesting the presence of free noncitizens. Archaeological investigation has yielded the remains of stone buildings, fortification walls and towers, streets, etc. dating from C4 , the period when the town was renamed Gorgippia (Koshelenko et al . ( 1984 ) 82 -83 ; Alekseeva ( 1997 ) 83 -148 ). Aphrodite, Herakles and Demeter were the main civic cults (Alekseeva ( 1997 ) 213 -50 ). Fragments of monumental buildings may be remains of temples dedicated to these and other divinities (ibid. 100 -48 ). There are fairly numerous silver coins with the inscription ΣΙΝ∆ΩΝ dating from c. 440 -400 (Stolba ( 1998 ) 603 -4 ). These coins may have been minted in Sindikos Limen (before it was renamed Gorgippia) on behalf of the local Sindoi (Shelov ( 1981 ); Price ( 1993 ) 1008 -9 ; cf. Strabo 11 . 2 . 10 ). Alternatively, they were minted by the Sindoi, proving the existence of a Sindic kingdom (Krushkol ( 1971 ) 80 -90 ). Recently, a third interpretation has been advanced: that the coins were an 'alliance' issue of the Greek cities situated on the Taman Peninsula (since this area was known as Sindike, after the local population-the Sindoi) who had united against the aggression of the Spartokids (Zavojkin and Boldyrev ( 1994 ); Tokhtasyev ( 2001 ) 68 -79 ). The cityethnic Γοργιππέων is found only on Gorgippian coins of C2l-C1 (Price ( 1993 ) 986 )."
697,Hermonassa (Hermonaseites),The Black Sea Area,45.15,36.45,638,3438,"697 . Hermonassa (Hermonaseites) Map 87 . Lat. 45 . 15 , long. 36 . 45 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: A: α . Hermonassa was situated on a small island (Ps.-Skymnos 886 -91 ; Steph. Byz. 278 . 10 ) in the Asiatic part of the Kimmerian Bosporos (Strabo 11 . 2 . 10 ). The toponym is ' Ερ µ ώνασσα (Hecat. fr. 208 ; Ps.-Skymnos 886 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ερ µ ωνασείτης ( IOSPE IV 334 = CIRB 495 (first century ad )). Hecat. fr. 208 and Theopomp. fr. 370 call it a polis , Hekataios probably in the urban sense (cf. Steph. Byz. 278 . 10 -15 with Hansen ( 1997 a ) 23 ). The external and individual use of the city-ethnic is attested in a sepulchral inscription of the first century ad , found at Kerch (Pantikapaion; IOSPE iv 334 = CIRB 495 ). The foundation of Hermonassa is dated archaeologically to about 580 -570 (Kuznetsov ( 1991 b ) 34 ). In the written sources the origin of the colonists is confused. Arrian ( Bith . fr. 55 , Roos = FGrHist 156 , fr. 71 ) links the foundation to Hermonassa, the wife of a certain Semandros from Aiolian Mytilene (no. 798 ). Citing Dionysios and Ps.-Skymnos, Stephanos of Byzantion calls it an Ionian colony ( 278 . 11 -12 ). Eustathios ( GGM ii 324 ) informs us that the oikistes of Hermonassa was a certain Hermon and that Hermonassa had been colonised by Ionians.Some scholars have attempted to resolve the contradiction found in the written sources as follows: Arrian's mention of Aiolians should be explained by the fact that certain Aiolians, in particular inhabitants of Mytilene, had also been involved in the founding of Hermonassa side by side with the Ionians. One name in an Archaic graffito (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1983 ) 369 n. 20 ) is of Aiolian origin (or influence), but in C4 , according to an inscription ( CIRB 1056 ), the population of the city was mainly Ionian. From C5e the city was part of the Bosporan Kingdom and dependent on Pantikapaion (no. 705 ) (Hind ( 1994 ) 484 ; Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 55 -57 , 68 -80 ). The chora of Hermonassa was not seriously studied until 1996 . Excavations by the State Hermitage Museum yielded a rural settlement established in the late Archaic period (Solovyov and Butyagin ( 1998 a )). The Archaic and Classical levels of the town have not been studied extensively because those levels of the city lie at a depth of 12 m and the Greek and Roman levels at 6 to 7 m. The rest are Byzantine-mediaeval. Some Archaic pits have been discovered, and the remains of Classical stone and mudbrick buildings (Koshelenko et al . ( 1984 ) 81 -82 ; Korovina ( 1992 )). Although architectural remains of the Archaic period are scanty,other categories of archaeological material provide evidence of intense economic and cultural activity at Hermonassa in C6l/C5e (Zeest ( 1961 ), ( 1968 ), ( 1974 )). The most interesting material includes dedicatory inscriptions of C5 -C4 , to Apollo Ietros (Pichikyan ( 1984 ) 152 ), the Ephesian Artemis (a temple probably existed here; cf. M. J. Treister and Vinogradov ( 1993 ) 559 fig. 26 ), Apollo Prostates ( CIRB 1034 , 1044 ) and Apollo Delphinios ( CIRB 1038 ). Probably this temple and the walls existed in the Classical period. Important finds are two measures bearing the name of an agoranomos by the name of Apollodoros (Hind ( 1983 -84 ) 90 ). One graffito of the third quarter of C6from the site indicates the presence of a craftsman from Eleutherna in Crete (M. J. Treister and Shelov-Kovedyaev ( 1989 ))."
698,Karkinitis (Kerkinites),The Black Sea Area,45.1,33.1,864,4314,"698 . Karkinitis (Kerkinites) Map 23 . Lat. 45 . 10 , long. 33 . 10 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Καρκινῖτις , -ιδος (Hecat. fr. 153 ; Hdt. 4 . 55 , 99 . 2 ), from c. 300 Κερκινῖτις ( IOSPE i² 401 , 453 ; Arr. Peripl. M. Eux. 30 ). The city-ethnic is Κερκινίτης ( IG ii² 1008 . iv . 114 (C2l)). Karkinitis was listed in Hekataios' Periodos and may in this work have been classified as a πόλις Σκυθική (( FGrHist 1 ) fr. 184 = Steph. Byz. 360 . 1 ), which ought to mean geographically within Skythia. Karkinitis is called a polis ( sc . 'Greek') in the urban sense by Hdt. 4 . 55 , 99 . 2 . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is presumably attested in abbreviated form on C5 -C4 coins ( infra ). Hdt. 4 . 99 . 2 locates Karkinitis in αρχαίη Σκυθίη , toward mountainous Taurica, east of ' Υλαίη ('Woodland') and near the joint mouths of two of his Scythian rivers, Hypakiris and Gerrhos, where Skythian Nomades ranged the interior. Strabo ( 7 . 3 . 18 , 4 . 2 ) mentions two 'gulfs' , one Tamyrake, near the isthmus of the Crimea (Perekop), and a second, Karkinitis, which 'comes next and is very large' , though he also gives both names to one gulf. Arrian's Periplous ( 30 ) gives the important information that Karkinitis was 600 stades from Chersonesos, which directs us to Eupatoria. These sources have prompted some scholars to posit a Karkinitis/Carcine and a quite separate Karkinitis (Minns ( 1913 ) 490 ; Rybakov ( 1979 ) 50 ; Barr . Map 22 ). But the Greek settlement found on the Quarantine headland, just west of Eupatoria, dating from C6l and fortified from C5m,seems to fit the description in our earlier and better-informed sources (Nalivkina ( 1963 ); Kutajsov ( 1990 ) 15 -18 , 48 -55 ). Pottery of C6l-C5 has been found ( 1950 s, 1980 s), as well as early pit shelters and a C5 defensive wall (Kutajsov ( 1990 ) 35 -39 , 40 -55 ). The original area is said to have been some 3 . 5 ha, but was by C4 over 5 ha. Some 270 -90 households are estimated to have dwelt within, and an external chora to the west of about 1 , 400 ha was divided on the Chersonesite model into allotments of 4 . 5 ha (ibid. 150 ). Dating to C4 is a letter written on an amphora sherd from one Apatourios to a Neomenios, concerning tribute owed to the Skythians (Solomonik ( 1987 ); Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 21 ). The sole inscription on stone is a stele for Α µ βατίας ταtildeς ' Ηροδότο IOSPE i² 339 , of C4 and in Doric dialect. The suggestion that Karkinitis was a member of the Delian League rests on a massive restoration of the name from the first two letters Κα [ ρκινῖτις ] ( IG i³ 71 . iv . 165 ).An alternative conjecture is Kallatis (no. 686 ) (Pippidi ( 1971 ) 63 -64 = SEG 22 9 and supra ). It has been suggested that north-western Crimea was, in C5 and until C4m, under the political influence of Olbia (no. 690 ), but was then appropriated by Chersonesos (no. 695 ) in unknown circumstances (Rusyaeva ( 1986 ) 57 ; Zolotaryov ( 1986 ) 92 ). But it is preferable to see Karkinitis as an independent polis , though one in a general cultural relationship with its more flourishing fellow Ionian city (Kutajsov ( 1990 ) 153 -57 ). By C4m it was a part of the Chersonesite polis , and included in the citizen's oath of C4l/C3e ( IOSPE i² 401 . 8 , 20 = Syll . ³ 360 ). The attestation of the city-ethnic in an Athenian list of epheboi ( IG ii² 1008 . iv . 114 ) of C2l indicates that it had become a dependent polis rather than just a civic subdivision of Chersonesos. The earliest struck coins of Karkinitis are of bronze and date to c. 350 (according to Stolba ( 1996 ) 236 -37 they were issued for only a few years, c. 345 -340 ). Types: ( 1 ) obv .

699,Kepoi (Kepites),The Black Sea Area,45.2,37.0,484,2563,"699 . Kepoi (Kepites) Map 87 . Lat. 45 . 20 , long. 37 . 00 . Size of territory: 1 ( infra ). Type: [A]: α . Kepoi was situated on what was once an island in the Asiatic part of the Kimmerian Bosporos (Ps.-Skylax 72 ; Strabo 11 . 2 . 10 ). The toponym is Κηtildeποι (Aeschin. 1 . 171 ; Ps.-Skylax 72 ). The city-ethnic is Κηπίτης ( CIRB 188 (C4m)). At Ps.-Skylax 72 Kepoi is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις δεgrave ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where the term polis is used in the urban sense. See also Harp. s.v. Κηtildeπος . The external and individual use of the city-ethnic is found in a burial inscription of C4m from Pantikapaion ( CIRB 188 ). According to Plin. HN 6 . 18 and Ps.-Skymnos 899 , Diller, Kepoi was founded by Miletos (no. 854 ). Several dozen fragments of East Greek pottery date the foundation to about 580 -570 (Kuznetsov ( 1991 a ), ( 1991 b ) 34 ). From C5e the city was part of the Bosporan Kingdom and dependent on Pantikapaion (no. 705 ) (Aeschin. 3 . 171 ; Hind ( 1994 ) 484 ; Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 57 , 68 -80 ). It is believed that Kepoi was situated some 3 km east of Phanagoria (no. 706 ), and that its area was 20 ha. The site is so damaged by quarry workings that it is very difficult to be certain that the site really is Kepoi. So far, no inscriptions have been found on the site to confirm its location. The Archaic and Classical levels were destroyed in Antiquity,first of all in C6l by a levelling of the area after a fire. Furthermore, in the Heltic period the whole area was terraced. Excavation reveals scant remains of stone and mudbrick dwellings of C6l/C5e. Several Archaic pits contained large amounts of pottery. Fragments of a kouros and of marble sculptures of Aphrodite were also found (Sokolskij ( 1963 ); Koshelenko et al . ( 1984 ) 84 -86 ; Kuznetsov ( 1991 a ), ( 1992 )). Most probably two temples of Aphrodite existed in Kepoi, one situated on the north-west edge of the city and the other on the south-east edge (Tsetskhladze and Kuznetsov ( 2000 )). The cult of Aphrodite is attested by dedicatory inscriptions of the Classical period (ibid. ( 2000 ) 353 with refs.; cf. SEG 45 990 ). Strabo 11 . 2 . 10 mentions a 'sanctuary of Aphrodite, called Apatouron'in the Taman Peninsula (the Asiatic part of the Bosporan Kingdom). Some scholars think that Apatouron was situated in Kepoi (Tsetskhladze and Kuznetsov ( 2000 ) 353 with refs.). No fortification walls or local coinage are known so far. The view of Tokhtasyev ( 1986 ) that Apatouron was a separate site in Taman is preferable."
700,Kimmerikon,The Black Sea Area,45.0,36.1,339,1577,"700 . Kimmerikon Map 87 . Lat. 45 . 00 , long. 36 . 10 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C: α . Kimmerikon was situated in the European part of Bosporos (Strabo 11 . 2 . 5 , but at 11 . 2 . 4 he mentions Kimmerikon as a kome in the Taman Peninsula (Asiatic Bosporos) as well).The location is a matter of scholarly dispute (cf. Ps.-Skymnos 896 -99 ; Usacheva and Koshelenko ( 1994 ); Zavojkin ( 1997 ), ( 1999 a ), ( 1999 b )). The toponym is Κι µµ ερικόν (Strabo 11 . 2 . 5 ; Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 76 ). Strabo classifies the place as a polichnion ( 7 . 4 . 5 ) but says that it had once been a polis ( 11 . 2 . 5 ). Aspottery finds suggest (Gorlov and Lopanov ( 1997 ) 141 ), Kimmerikon had some east Greek settlers by C6m. It has been suggested that the place was a member of the Delian League, but this is based on an uncertain restoration of the name Κι µ [ µ ερικόν ] ( IG i³ 71 . iv . 166 has Κι µ [---]) (cf. Avram ( 1995 ) 195 ; Tsetskhladze ( 1997 a ) 462 -65 ). From C5e the city was part of the Bosporan Kingdom and dependent on Pantikapaion (no. 705 ) (Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 64 , 68 -71 ). The site has not been well studied. The first walls with towers were erected in C5l/C4e (Gorlov and Lopanov ( 1995 ), ( 1997 ) 141 ). The walls enclose an area of 2 km ² . The city was situated on terraces. Early Greek pottery dates from C6m. All architectural remains date from the Heltic and Roman periods (Koshelenko et al . ( 1984 ) 71 -72 ; Gorlov and Lopanov ( 1997 )). According to Ps.-Skymnos 895 -7 , Diller, Kimmeris ( sic ) was a foundation of the Bosporan rulers."
701,Kytaia,The Black Sea Area,45.05,36.25,282,1391,"701 . Kytaia Map 87 . Lat. 45 . 05 , long. 36 . 25 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: [A]: α . Kytaia was situated in the European part of Bosporos (Ps.-Skylax 68 ; Plin. HN 4 . 86 ; Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 50 ; Ptol. Geog . 3 . 6 . 5 ). The toponym is Κυacuteταια (Ps.Skylax 68 ; Lycoph. Alex . 1312 ). At Ps.-Skylax 68 Kytaia is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις δεgrave ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where the term polis is used in the urban sense. Kytaia was already occupied by east Greeks by C5e (Molev ( 1985 ) 59 ). From C5e the city was part of the Bosporan Kingdom and dependent on Pantikapaion (no. 705 ) (Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 64 , 68 -80 ). A defensive wall was erected in C4e. Its destruction dates from C3 -C2 , after which the wall was strengthened from a width of about 3 m to nearly 3 . 5 m (Molev ( 1985 ); Koshelenko et al . ( 1984 ) 71 ). The city had stone buildings from C5 , but their state of preservation and the small scale of excavations do not allow us to establish the character of these buildings and the plan of the city (Molev ( 1985 )). The excavator proposed a location of the agora in excavation trench no. V (Molev ( 1985 ) 59 ). Excavation of the site produced a shrine/cultic ash mound ( eskhara ) (Moleva ( 1997 )). Aphrodite, Apollo, Herakles, Demeter, Zeus, Artemis were objects of communal cults (Moleva ( 1997 ); Semicheva ( 1997 ))."
702,"Labrys or, rather, Labryta",The Black Sea Area,45.1,37.35,250,1294,"702 . *Labrys or, rather, Labryta Map 84 . Lat. 45 . 10 , long. 37 . 35 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: γ . The only source for this polis is a C4e versified dedication to Apollo-in-Labry[--] set up by Leukon, the archon of Bosporos and Theodosia, in celebration of his victory over Oktamasades, the king of the Sindoi ( SEG 48 1027 , an improved republication of SEG 43 515 ). The inscription was found in Semibratnee, c. 35 km north of Gorgippia. The name of the polis is attested in lines 2 -3 : Απόλλωνι . . . τῶι εν Λ [ αβρυ -?] τηtildeσδε πόλεως µ εδέοντι Λαβρυτων . The toponym *Labrys is derived from what is commonly believed to be the city-ethnic: the gen. plur. Λαβρυτῶν , in nom. sing. Λαβρυacuteτης . The problem is that names in the genitive governed by µ εδέων are always toponyms and never ethnics; cf. e.g. IOSPE ii 23 and IG xii . 5 893 . 1 . It follows that Λαβρυacuteτων is probably the genitive of the toponym Λάβρυτα , τά (cf. Βουacuteχετα , τά , Dem. 7 . 32 ) whereas the city-ethnic is unattested. Labryta is called a polis both in the political sense (l. 3 ) and in the urban sense (l. 7 ). It appears from the dedication that Apollo was the patron divinity of the city. There is no other evidence of Helation, and Labryta was presumably a predominantly barbarian site."
703,Myrmekeion,The Black Sea Area,45.2,36.3,467,2300,"703 . Myrmekeion Map 87 . Lat. 45 . 20 , long. 36 . 30 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: [A]: α . Myrmekeion was situated in the European part of the Kimmerian Bosporos (Ps.-Skylax 68 ; Strabo 7 . 4 . 5 , 11 . 2 . 6 ). The toponym is Μυρ µ ήκειον (Ps.Skylax 68 ); later authors have Μυρ µ ήκιον (Strabo 7 . 4 . 5 ; Steph. Byz. 464 . 1 ). At Ps.-Skylax 68 Myrmekeion is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις δεgrave ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where the term polis is used in the urban sense; there is no evidence that Myrmekeion was ever an independent polis (Y. A. Vinogradov ( 1993 ), ( 1995 a ) 159 -60 , ( 2000 )). Pottery finds indicate Ionian settlers from c. 580 -560 (Kuznetsov ( 1991 b ) 33 ). The city's armed forces are possibly mentioned in one very fragmented inscription of C4 ( CIRB 869 ). From C5e the city was part of the Bosporan Kingdom (Y. A. Vinogradov ( 1993 ); Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 61 -62 , 68 -71 ). Myrmekeion had an acropolis protected by a wall of C6l/C5e (Y. A. Vinogradov and Tokhtasyev ( 1994 ); Y. A. Vinogradov ( 1995 b )). The city covered an area of 6 ha (Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 62 ) and had a defence circuit erected in C4e (Koshelenko et al . ( 1984 ) 66 ); the north fortification wall with tower was built in C4e. The first inhabitants lived in dug-outs. Stone architecture dates from C6l/C5e after the city was attacked by Skythians. From C5 the city had a rectangular plan and temples (Gajdukevi˘ c ( 1987 ) 5 -36 ; Y. A. Vinogradov ( 1991 ), ( 1993 ); Y. A. Vinogradov and Tokhtasyev ( 1994 ); Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 61 -62 ). The patron deity was Apollo Ietros (Y.A.Vinogradov and Tokhtasyev ( 1998 ) 25 -29 ). Other communal cults include those of Herakles,Aphrodite,Zeus and the Nymphs ( SEG 27 437 ; graffiti of C6e-C5e; BE ( 1990 ) 587 , all C5m-C5l; Denisova ( 1981 ) 116 ; Y. A. Vinogradov and Tokhtasyev ( 1998 )). Remains of a shrine of Aphrodite and an ash mound ( eskhara ) of C5f-C4e have been found on the acropolis (Gajdukevi˘ c ( 1971 ) 182 , ( 1987 ) 66 -70 ; Y. A. Vinogradov and Tokhtasyev ( 1994 ) 57 ). Previously it was thought that silver coins with the obverse type of an ant were minted by Myrmekeion, but their minting is now connected with Pantikapaion (no. 705 ) (Shelov ( 1956 ) 28 -30 ; Frolova ( 1992 ) 205 -7 )."
704,Nymphaion (Nymphatos/Nymphaites),The Black Sea Area,45.15,36.25,931,4823,"704 . Nymphaion (Nymphatos/Nymphaites) Map 87 . Lat. 45 . 15 , long. 36 . 25 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: [A]: β . Nymphaion was situated in the European part of the Kimmerian Bosporos (Ps.-Skylax 68 ; Strabo 7 . 4 . 4 ). The toponym is Νυacute µ φαιον (Aeschin. 3 . 171 ); Ps.-Skylax 68 has Νυ µ φαία . The city-ethnic is Νυacute µ φατος ( IOSPE ii . 201 (C4 ?) now lost) or Νυ µ φαιdieresisacuteτης ( Syll . ³ 1126 (C2l)). At Ps.-Skylax 68 Nymphaia is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις δεgrave ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where the term polis is used in the urban sense. The external and individual use of the city-ethnic is found in two inscriptions: a tombstone from Pantikapaion ( IOSPE ii 201 ) and a dedication from Delos ( Syll . ³ 1126 ). The internal and collective sense is probably attested on coins ( infra ). Nymphaion, it has recently been suggested, may have been established by Milesians in the 560 s (Kuznetsov ( 1991 b ) 33 ), but this is unproven. Until 1983 , when inscriptions with the names of the months of an east Greek calendar were discovered (Y. A. Vinogradov and Tokhtasyev ( 1994 )), pottery finds had led some scholars to assume that the metropolis of Nymphaion must have been Samos (no. 864 ) (Gajdukevi˘ c ( 1949 ) 175 ). None of the written sources mentions the name of the metropolis . Nymphaion was a member of the Delian League and was assessed to pay a tribute of 1 tal. (Krateros ( FGrHist 242 ) fr. 8 = IG i³ 100 ; Tsetskhladze ( 1997 a )). But Νυacute [ µ φαιον ] at IG i² 63 . 190 has been changed into [ Αρ ] γί [ λιοι ] at IG i³ 71 . iii . 176 . Nymphaion was lost c. 410 -405 (Aeschin. 3 . 171 ; ATL i. 527 -28 ) and incorporated into the Bosporan Kingdom by Satyros I ( 433 / 2 -389 / 8 ) (Shelov-Kovedyaev ( 1985 ) 90 -91 ; Zavojkin ( 1995 ) 92 ). Hereafter Nymphaion was a dependency of Pantikapaion (no. 705 ) ( SEG 45 996 ( 389 -349 ); Hind ( 1994 ) 498 ; Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 78 -80 ). C3 inscriptions on a wall record, inter al ., the months of the year Thargelion,Taureon,Kalamaion,indicating the use of the Milesian calendar in Nymphaion (Y. A. Vinogradov and Tokhtasyev ( 1994 ); Trümpy, Monat . 93 ). In the Archaic period the chora of Nymphaion was small, and only a few rural settlements are known; the Classical and Heltic settlements number a few hundred. In 1993 -97 a joint Russian-Ukrainian-Polish team surveyed the chora of Nymphaion (Scholl and Zinko ( 1999 )). Before this joint project, which included excavation of a limited number of rural settlements and burial sites, as well as a survey (Wasowicz ( 1994 ); Solovyov and Zinko ( 1994 ); Zinko ( 1996 ), ( 1998 ); Vlasova and Solovyov ( 1998 )), the question of the overall area of the chora and the ethnic composition of its population were far from clear and subject to heated debate. The city walls of Nymphaion were probably erected in C5e (Tolstikov ( 1997 ) 209 ) and the acropolis was fortified in C5l/C4e (Chistov ( 1998 a )). The first colonists lived in dug-outs (Butyagin ( 1997 ); cf. Solovyov and Butyagin ( 1998 b )). After C6mstone and mudbrick buildings appear and a shrine dedicated to Demeter was constructed (cf. Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 50 n. 29 ) in a temenos which in C5 had a walled area of 60 m ² . The shrine was destroyed by fire in C6l. In C5 -C4 , monumental buildings (some in the Ionic style) began to be constructed in the city: an acropolis, streets and a new temple to Demeter and Aphrodite. In C4e the city was destroyed, but was soon rebuilt with a new fortification system and monumental, richly decorated buildings. The discovery of a pottery kiln and wine-making complexes shows the city to have been a craft and agricultural centre in C6 -C4 (Koshelenko et al . ( 1984 ) 63 -64 ; Grach ( 1989 ); Sokolova ( 1997 ); Chistov ( 1998 b ); Boriskovskaya ( 1999 )). Strabo 7 . 4 . 4 stresses the city's good harbour, the location of which is problematic (Belenkij ( 1998 )). As studies of the Nymphaion cemetery (Grach ( 1999 ); Vlasova and Solovyov ( 1998 )) demonstrate, the population of the city had close connections with the Skythians (cf. Grach ( 1981 ); Butyagin ( 1998 )). Finds of hand-made pottery, jewellery and rich tombs with Skythian burial customs (Vickers ( 1979 ); Grach ( 1999 )) show that the Skythian nobility probably participated in the life of the city. In C5l Nymphaion struck coins of silver (very rare drachms, diobols and hemiobols). Obv . head of nymph l. with hair bound up; rev . bunch of grapes; legend: ΝΥΝ or ΝΥ in C5l (Anokhin ( 1986 ) 15 , 29 , 138 ). The mysterious mint issuing coins briefly ( obv . head of nymph r.; rev . head of lion r. in incuse; legend: ΣΑΜΜΑ ) has recently been suggested to be Nymphaion (Stolba ( 1998 )); Sammas is supposed to have been a refugee and tyrant at Nymphaion c. 439 -436 ."
705,Pantikapaion (Pantikapaites) /Bosporos (Bosporites),The Black Sea Area,45.2,36.3,1918,9969,"705 . Pantikapaion (Pantikapaites) /Bosporos (Bosporites) Map 87 . Lat. 45 . 20 , long. 36 . 30 . Size of territory: 3 / 4 . Type: [A]: β . Pantikapaion was situated in the European part of the Kimmerian Bosporos (Strabo 11 . 2 . 10 ). The toponym is Παντικάπαιον , τό (Dem. 35 . 31 -34 ; Ps.-Skylax 68 ) or, alternatively, Βόσπορος , οasper ( CIRB 6 ; Dem. 34 . 36 ). In the opinion of some scholars the early name for the city was Kremnoi, mentioned by Hdt. 4 . 20 . 1 as an emporion (Hind ( 1997 ) 111 -15 ). The city-ethnic is Παντικαπαιdieresisacuteτης ( CIRB 37 ( c. 370 )) or, later, Παντικαπαιευacuteς ( Syll . ³ 585 ( 197 -75 )) or Παντικαπαείτης ( RPh 63 ( 1937 ) 325 -33 (C4 )) or Βοσπορίτης ( IG ii² 8429 (C4s)). AtPs.-Skylax 68 Pantikapaion is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις δεgrave ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where the term polis is used in the urban sense; cf. also Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 50 . At Dem. 20 . 33 and 34 . 34 Bosporos ( = Pantikapaion) is described as an emporion . The external and individual use of the city-ethnic ( Παντικαπαιdieresisacuteτης ) is found in a fragmentary decree of c. 370 found at Pantikapaion, a copy of an honorific decree for Leukon I ( 389 / 8 -349 / 8 ) passed by the Arkadian Federation ( CIRB 37 ). The internal collective use is found in abbreviated form on coins (Price ( 1993 ) 918 -58 ; Frolova ( 1996 ) 152 -53 ). For proxeny decrees issued by the Bosporan kings, see CIRB 1 -5 ; twelve such decrees are now known (M. J. Treister and Vinogradov ( 1993 ) 545 ). A citizen of Pantikapaion was awarded proxenia by Chios (no. 840 ) in C4 ( PEP Chios 50 . 20 = RPh 63 ( 1937 ) 325 -33 ). Pantikapaion was founded c. 575 . Written sources attest that it was Milesian (Strabo 7 . 4 . 4 ; Plin. HN 4 . 86 ; Amm. Marc. 22 . 8 . 36 ), and archaeological evidence agrees (Kuznetsov ( 1991 b ) 33 ). C. 480 (Diod. 12 . 31 . 1 ) Pantikapaion became the capital of the Bosporan Kingdom (Ephor.fr. 158 ), created primarily by the need to withstand Skythian pressure on the Greek cities situated on the Kerch and Taman peninsulas, i.e. the Kimmerian Bosporos (Gajdukevi˘ c ( 1971 ); Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 100 -32 ; Hind ( 1994 ); contra , for a later date of creation of the Bosporan Kingdom, Vasilyev ( 1992 ); Zavojkin ( 1994 )). Thus, the Greek poleis of the Kimmerian Bosporos (except Theodosia (no. 707 ), Nymphaion (no. 704 ) and possibly Phanagoria (no. 706 )) were united under the auspices of Pantikapaion (Blavatskij ( 1964 ) 24 -93 ). The Bosporan Kingdom was first ruled over by the Archaianaktidai (probably of Milesian origin), a clan of tyrannoi whose power lasted for 42 years (Diod. 12 . 31 . 1 ). All cities were self-governing poleis , but all were dependent on Pantikapaion. None of the other cities possessed a separate coinage until 450 -425 ; and C4 rulers spent much time keeping the cities within their kingdom. At the same time the Pantikapaion tyrants started to establish new towns (Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 79 with refs.). A new dynasty, the Spartokids (of Thracian origin) came to power in 438 / 7 , and the creation of the Bosporan state was nearly complete (Y.G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 115 -16 , 129 -30 ). This dynasty ruled for more than 300 years (until 109 ). Its rulers called themselves ' Archon of Bosporos and Theodosia and King of the Sindoi, Toretai, Dandarioi and Psessoi' or of 'the Sindoi and Maiotai' ( CIRB 6 , 8 -11 , 37 , 113 , 972 , 1013 -15 , 1037 -40 , 1111 ; Hind ( 1994 ) 495 -502 ). From the outset the main aim of the new dynasty was to incorporate Theodosia (no. 707 ), Nymphaion (no. 704 ) and possibly Phanagoria (no. 706 ) into the Bosporan Kingdom by force, these three independent poleis being opposed to the rulers of Pantikapaion. Several dynasts were preoccupied with this: Satyros I ( 433 / 2 -389 / 8 ), Leukon I ( 389 / 8 -349 / 8 ), Spartokos II ( 349 / 8 -344 / 3 ) and Pairisades I ( 344 / 3 -311 / 10 ) (Hind ( 1994 )). From C5m it was the policy first of the Archaianaktidai and then of the Spartokidai to incorporate the local population of the Taman Peninsula (Asiatic Bosporos) into the kingdom through the establishment of Bosporan emporia in their settlements (Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 60 -71 ). This task was virtually completed by Leukon I ( 389 / 8 -349 / 8 ), and the Sindoi and others were incorporated peacefully. In the time of Pairisades I ( 344 / 43 -311 / 10 ) Bosporan territory reached its maximum extent, stretching from the Tauroi to the Caucasus. For a C4e treaty of symmachia between Leukon I ( 389 / 8 -349 / 8 ) and Olbia (no. 690 ), see SEG 45 1000 . In the Archaic period the territory of Pantikapaion was small. In C6 the towns of Myrmekeion (no. 703 ), Tyritake (no. 708 ) and Porthmion were established by Pantikapaion, probably as dependent poleis (the first two) and a teichos (the last) to protect its territory from the local population (mainly Skythians) (Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 68 -69 , 72 ). For C6six rural settlements are recorded; for C5 about twenty; and more than 200 from C4 (Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 72 ). T o establish the exact extent of the territory of Pantikapaion is very difficult, because, after the creation of the Bosporan Kingdom, three types of land ownership were established: civic community land,royal land (Isoc. 17 . 3 ; Dem. 20 . 31 ) and temple land (Maslennikov ( 1998 a ) 26 -36 ; Tsetskhladze ( 1998 b ) 39 ). Excavations during the last decade have yielded several dozen very rich farmhouses in the eastern Crimea (Maslennikov ( 1998 a ), ( 1998 b ); Vinokurov ( 1998 )). They probably belonged to the royal family and to rich citizens of Pantikapaion. The town of Pantikapaion can be traced back to c. 575 (pottery finds: Kuznetsov ( 1991 b ) 33 ) and was built on the site of an earlier local settlement, Pantikapa (Strabo 7 . 4 . 4 ; Plin. HN 4 . 26 ; Blavatskij ( 1964 ) 9 -23 ). The city walls were erected in C5e (Tolstikov ( 1997 ) 214 -26 ). The fortification walls of the acropolis date from C5l/C4f (Tolstikov ( 1984 b )). The city occupied the summit and slopes of Mt.Mithridates and a lower seaside terrace in modern-day Kerch. For a description of the city, see Strabo 7 . 4 . 4 . In C4 the city covered c. 10 ha (Koshelenko et al . ( 1984 ) 125 ). Archaeological excavation has demonstrated that the first Greeks lived in dug-outs (Tolstikov ( 1992 ), ( 1996 )). The beginning of stone architecture dates from the third quarter of C6 , and the appearance of streets, monumental buildings and town planning to the last quarter of C6 . To this latter period is dated the building of a tholos . All of this indicates the transformation of Pantikapaion into a typical Greek polis (Tolstikov ( 1996 )). It is thought that in C6s there was a sanctuary for Apollo on the upper plateau of Mt. Mithridates (Tolstikov ( 1992 ) 62 -66 ). In C6l/C5e dug-out constructions again appear, a phenomenon that some scholars connect with the difficult political situation (Skythian pressure) on the Kimmerian Bosporos. In C5m comes a period in which monumental stone architecture is a characteristic type of construction.In C5m a huge temple to Apollo was erected in the temenos /acropolis of the city (Pichikyan ( 1984 ) 156 -65 ). C4 was a period of prosperity that saw many grand public buildings (some with mosaic floors: so-called ' andron with pebble mosaic of C5l-C4e') and temples constructed, and the acropolis (the western part of whose fortification system was built in C4e: Tolstikov and Zhuravlyov ( 1998 ) 25 ) enlarged. By C4l/C3e the royal palace was built there. Finds of architectural details, sculptures, etc. show that the buildings were richly decorated (Koshelenko et al . ( 1984 ) 59 -63 ; Tolstikov ( 1987 ), ( 1992 ) 78 -94 ; M. J. Treister and Vinogradov ( 1993 ) 544 -46 ). Epigraphic evidence and dedicatory inscriptions indicate that from about 540 there was a temple on the upper plateau of Mt. Mithridates dedicated to Ephesian Artemis (M.Y. Treister ( 1990 )). From at least C4e there were temples, altars and shrines on the acropolis dedicated to Apollo Prostates ( CIRB 6 , 10 , 25 ; Tolstikov ( 1992 ) 95 n. 9 ), Artemis ( CIRB 64 ), Zeus (Tolstikov ( 1992 ) 95 n. 11 ), Aphrodite (Tolstikov ( 1992 ) 95 n. 12 ) and Demeter ( CIRB 8 ). From C6 , Pantikapaion became a centre for crafts and trade. Workshops for metal working were found on the northern slope of Mt. Mithridates, and on the western plateau, where the earliest dug-outs of the first settlers were discovered (M. Y. Treister ( 1987 ), ( 1992 ), ( 1998 )). From C6l the city produced also painted pottery, clay weights, terracotta figurines, etc. (Koshelenko et al . ( 1984 ) 59 -63 ). Pantikapaion struck coins of silver from C5e onwards and of gold in C4 . ( 1 ) Silver and bronze C5e onwards: denominations: drachm, hemidrachm, diobol. Types: obv . lion's scalp facing; rev . incuse square with symbol; legend: ΠΑΝ or ΠΑΝΤ or ΠΑΝΤΙ , on some ΑΠ or ΑΠΟΛ . ( 2 ) Silver and bronze C4 : obv . head of Pan or satyr; rev . head of bull, or griffin,or lion,or lion with spear in mouth; legend: ΠΑΝ or ΠΑΝΤ or ΠΑΝΤΙ . ( 3 ) Gold in C4 : denominations: stater, hemistater. Types: obv . bearded head of Pan or satyr; rev . griffin with spear in mouth standing on ear of corn; legend: ΠΑΝ (Frolova ( 1992 ); Price ( 1993 ) 836 -917 ; SNG Cop. Thrace 17 -24 ). The full form of the city-ethnic, ΠΑΝΤΙΚΑΠΑΙΤΩΝ , appears on coins of C3 and later ( SNG Cop. Thrace 27 ). Coins of c. 460 -440 with the inscription ΑΠΟΛ (as well as ΠΑ / ΑΠ ) cause problems. The prevailing view is that these coins were struck at the mint of the temple of Apollo in Pantikapaion (built in the second quarter of C5 ) as an 'alliance' issue of the cities of the Kimmerian Bosporos. These coins were not minted for long-until the last quarter of C5 , when the need for the confederation of Bosporan cities had passed (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 22 -23 ; Tolstikov ( 1984 a ) 47 -48 n. 47 ; Frolova ( 1995 ))."
706,Phanagoria (Phanagorites),The Black Sea Area,45.15,37.0,1109,5931,"706 . Phanagoria (Phanagorites) Map 87 . Lat. 45 . 15 , long. 37 . 00 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A: α . The city was situated in the Asiatic part of the Kimmerian Bosporos (Strabo 11 . 2 . 10 ). The toponyms are Φαναγόρια , Φαναγόρεια , Φαναγόρειον (Ps.-Skymnos 886 -89 ; Strabo 11 . 2 . 10 ). The city-ethnic is Φαναγορίτης ( SEG 41 625 (C1 )). Phanagoria is called a polis Hel byPs.-Skylax 72 , using polis in the urban sense; quoting Hecat. fr. 212 , Steph. Byz. ( 657 . 8 ) lists Phanagoria as a polis , but it is uncertain whether the site-classification stems from Hekataios (Hansen ( 1997 a ) 17 -18 ). Polis status, however, is strongly indicated by a fragmentary C4 proxeny decree from the site mentioning the rights of enktesis and politeia (Hind ( 1983 -84 ) 90 ). ΦΑ , attested on measuring vessels of C3 , and ΦΑΝΑ or ΦΑ , attested on coins of C5l/C4f, are probably abbreviated forms of the city-ethnic used in the internal and collective sense. The full form, ΦΑΝΑΓΟΡΙΤΩΝ , is found only on C2l-C1 coins (Price ( 1993 ) 995 -1007 ) whereas the external and individual use appears in App. Mith . 108 . Phanagoria was founded by Teians (no. 868 ) (Ps.Skymnos 886 ) and, according to Arrian, the oikistes was Phanagoras of Teos, who had sought refuge from Persian influence (( FGrHist 156 ) fr. 71 ). Thus, Phanagoria must have been founded c. 545 -540 , a date confirmed by excavation in the upper city of Ionian pottery, some belonging to the late stage of the late Wild Goat style and of contemporary Attic pottery (Kuznetsov ( 1998 ) 9 ; Arafat and Morgan ( 2000 )). Most probably Phanagoria was forced to join the Bosporan Kingdom either by Leukon I ( 389 / 8 -349 / 8 ) contemporaneously with Theodosia (no. 707 ), or by Spartokos II ( 349 / 8 -344 / 3 ) and was thereafter a polis depending on Pantikapaion (no. 705 ) ( Syll . ³ 214 -16 ; SEG 45 1016 , all found in Phanagoria; Gorlov ( 1986 ); Hind ( 1994 ) 498 ). The chora of Phanagoria is completely unknown, as are those of the other Greek colonies in the Taman Peninsula.A survey of the whole Taman Peninsula established that there are about 237 rural settlements of the Graeco-Roman and mediaeval periods, more than 500 barrows, and 150 km of ancient roads (Paromov ( 1990 ), ( 1992 ), ( 1997 ), ( 1998 )). At the present level of knowledge it is impossible to identify which rural settlements belonged to which poleis (Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 72 -73 and ( 1998 b ) 38 -39 , both with refs.). Two very rich farms near Phanagoria may have been situated in its chora (Savostina ( 1987 ), ( 1998 )). The first defensive walls of Phanagoria were erected in C5l (Gorlov ( 1986 ) 136 ). The city was situated on two plateaux on the coast of the Gulf of Taman in the Taman Peninsula. The city covered c. 75 ha, but c. 25 ha of the site is now under water. The city is surrounded by hills on which three large cemeteries are situated (Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 51 -55 with refs.). In C6 Phanagoria was situated on the upper plateau and had a rectangular plan of approximately 440 -450 × 500 m ( 20 -22 . 5 ha).Remains of C6 include dwelling houses built of mudbrick without any stone foundation and streets. Twelve houses built of either wattle or mudbrick were found, dating from 630 -620 to 500 -480 . In C5e the city was extended towards the south. In the cultural level of C5m to C4 were remains of workshops. In C6l houses on the upper plateau were destroyed, and the destruction level bears traces of fire. In C5e a large amount of construction work was undertaken. In the south-west part of the city the remains of the city gates were found. The houses were built from mudbrick, sometimes on stone foundations. During C5 the city spread on to a number of terraces and filled up the area between the upper and lower plateaux. Finds of, e.g., Ionic and Doric capitals point to monumental architecture. In C4 the city grew towards the east. The old fortification walls were destroyed in C4e as a result of a siege; afterwards large (re)construction works began, and the houses were built of limestone and other stones rather than mudbrick.The city had several shrines and temples, including 'a notable temple of Aphrodite Apatouros' (Strabo 11 . 2 . 10 ). In C6l there was a wooden shrine which was destroyed by fire in C5e. Terracotta figurines of Demeter, Artemis and Aphrodite have been found in a shrine not far from the city.Inscriptions were found in or near the agora or nearby; there was a temple of Aphrodite Ourania (Apatouron; CIRB 971 -72 ), located on a hill not far from the city ( CIRB 1111 = Tod 115 C).According to Tokhtasyev ( 1986 ), the Apatouron was a separate shrine on the Taman Peninsula. From the outset, Phanagoria was a very important city with its own diversified economy and craft production. Local painted pottery dates from C6l-C5 ; pottery kilns date from C4 . There were workshops for the production of architectural terracottas, bronze and iron objects, and life-size bronze statues. Study of fragments of stone sculptures and gravestones confirms the existence of local sculptors. Finds of imported tableware, amphoras and foreign coins show that Phanagoria was a trading centre (Smirnov ( 1956 ); Kobylina ( 1983 ), ( 1989 ); Koshelenko et al . ( 1984 ) 77 -81 ; Dolgorukov ( 1990 ); Dolgorukov and Kolesnikov ( 1993 ); Paromov ( 1993 ); Kuznetsov ( 1998 ), ( 1999 ) 555 -58 ). The city struck silver coins in C5l/C4e.Diobol: obv . beardless or more rarely a bearded head of a Kabyros (?) l. wearing high-crowned pilos , sometimes with laurel wreath; rev . bull, or forepart of bull l.; to r. an ear of corn; legend: ΦΑ . Trihemiobol: obv . same, but with more conical pilos ; rev . forepart of bull l., ear of corn to r.; legend: ΦΑΝΑ . Tetartemorion?: obv . beardless head left; rev . grain of corn; legend: ΦΑ (Shelov ( 1956 ) 49 -51 ; Price ( 1993 ) 987 -94 ; Zavojkin ( 1995 )). Phanagoria resumed its minting in C3l."
707,Theodosia (Theudosieus),The Black Sea Area,45.0,35.25,637,3125,"707 . Theodosia (Theudosieus) Map 87 . Lat. 45 . 00 , long. 35 . 25 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: [A]: β . Theodosia lay to the W. of the European part of the Kimmerian Bosporos (Ps.Skylax 68 ; Strabo 7 . 4 . 4 ; Arr. Peripl. M. Eux . 19 . 3 ). The toponym is Θευδοσία (Ps.-Skylax 68 ; Dem. 20 . 33 ). The cityethnic is Θευδοσιευacuteς ( CIRB 231 (C4f)); C5s-C4e coins ( infra ) are inscribed ΘΕΟ∆ΕΟ or ΘΕΟ∆ΕΩ , which presumably abbreviates an unknown form of the city-ethnic. At Ps.-Skylax 68 Theodosia is the first toponym listed after the heading πόλεις δεgrave ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε , where the term polis is used in the urban sense. At Dem. 20 . 33 Theodosia is called an emporion . The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested on coins ( infra ). The external and individual use is attested on a grave stele from Pantikapaion ( CIRB 231 (C4f)). Theodosia was founded by Miletos (no. 854 ) (Arr. Peripl. M. Eux . 19 . 3 ; Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 51 ) c. 570 (pottery find: Kuznetsov ( 1991 b ) 33 ). From the beginning the city was hostile to Pantikapaion (no. 705 ), opposing its tyrants during C5 and not joining the Bosporan Kingdom (Petrova ( 1991 )). It was aided by Chersonesos (no. 695 ) and Herakleia (no. 715 ) against the encroaching archontes of the Bosporan Kingdom (Saprykin ( 1997 ) 91 -98 ). C. 370 Leukon I ( 389 / 8 -349 / 8 ) conquered Theodosia and made it part of the Bosporan Kingdom, and thus it became dependent on Pantikapaion (no. 705 ) (Strabo 7 . 4 . 6 (rC4f)). In contemporary inscriptions C4 kings are described as ' archon of Bosporos and Theodosia' ( CIRB 6 , 6 a, 8 , 1014 , 1037 , 1111 ( Syll . ³ 214 ); cf. Burstein ( 1974 ); Petrova ( 1991 ); Hind ( 1994 ) 498 ; Saprykin ( 1997 ) 91 -98 ; Hansen ( 1997 c ) 90 ). Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 77 mentions some refugees from 'Bosporos'in Theodosia.It is believed that this information goes back to C5 , and that the refugees were from Pantikapaion, people who did not support the new dynasty, the Spartokids, who came to power in 438 / 7 (Gajdukevi˘ c ( 1971 ); Petrova ( 1991 ) 98 -99 ). Dem. 20 . 33 and Strabo 7 . 4 . 4 underline the city's fine harbour and fertile land, and the export of its grain to Athens. Archaeologically the city is not well known. During smallscale excavations a stone and mudbrick building dating from C5 overlaid by one of C4 -C3 was uncovered (Peters and Golentsov ( 1981 ); Koshelenko et al . ( 1984 ) 63 ; Hind ( 1983 -84 ) 85 , ( 1992 -93 ) 100 ). The chora is not well known. Minor settlements and a fortified farm of C4 have been excavated to the south and the west of Theodosia; the chora was populated both by Greeks and local people (Petrova ( 1996 ) 146 -50 ; Beysens et al . ( 1997 )). Theodosia struck coins of silver, probably in the 430 s, and bronze C4e. Obv . helmeted head of Athena; rev . bull's head facing; legend: ΘΕΟ∆ΕΟ , ΘΕΟ∆ΕΩ . Minting stopped most probably c. 370 when the city was conquered by the Bosporan king Leukon I ( 389 / 8 -349 / 8 ) and resumed in C4 (Anokhin ( 1989 ) 15 -16 , 29 -30 , 57 -58 , 138 -39 , 141 ; Stolba ( 1996 ) 235 ; Hansen ( 1997 c ) 90 )."

Tyritake was situated in the European part of the Kimmerian Bosporos (Ptol. Geog . 3 . 6 . 3 ; Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 50 ). The toponym is Τυριτάκη (Steph. Byz. 642 . 12 ; variant spellings at Ptol. Geog . and Anon. Peripl. M. Eux .). The only sources to list Tyritake as a polis are Steph. Byz. and Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . Tyritake was established in 580 -560 by Ionians (? from Miletos (no. 854 )) as is documented by pottery finds (Kuznetsov ( 1991 b ) 33 ). The settlement was probably a secondary one from the start, dependent on Pantikapaion (no. 705 ) (Tsetskhladze ( 1997 b ) 62 , 68 -80 ). City walls were erected in C5e (Tolstikov ( 1997 ) 209 ). The Archaic and Classical city is not well studied. Stone houses appear in C6s (remains of only two buildings have been excavated; cf.Koshelenko et al . ( 1984 ) 67 -68 ).Aphrodite and Demeter were amongst communal cults (Denisova ( 1981 ) 83 -88 ). The Tyritake rampart-a boundary line for strategic defence-stretches for a distance of over 25 km and was built to protect the chora of the European Bosporos in C5from the local population (Tolstikov ( 1997 ) 209 ). ## 3 .

709,Dioskouris,The Black Sea Area,43.0,41.0,514,2603,"709 . Dioskouris Map 87 . Lat. 43 . 00 , long. 41 . 00 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A: α . Dioskouris was situated in Kolchis, Eastern Black Sea (Ps.-Skylax 81 ; Strabo 11 . 2 . 16 ; Arr. Peripl. M.Eux . 10 . 4 ). The toponym is ∆ιοσκουρίς in Ps.-Skylax 81 , but ∆ιοσκουριάς in later sources (Strabo 1 . 3 . 2 ; Steph. Byz. 233 . 15 ). The city is called polis by Ps.-Skylax 81 using polis in the urban sense, and repeatedly in a fragmentary bronze inscription of C4l/C3e found in Eshera, not far from Dioskouris. Here polis is presumably used both in the political and in the urban sense (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 596 -601 ; Tsetskhladze ( 1998 a ) 23 -24 ). Amphora handles of C3 produced by Dioskouris are stamped with ∆ΙΟΣΚΟΥ , an abbreviation of either the toponym or, more likely, the city-ethnic used in the internal and collective sense (Tsetskhladze ( 1991 ) 362 -63 , 377 ). The bronze inscription from Eshera mentions events possibly linked with some military operations (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1997 ) 596 -601 ). According to Arr. Peripl. M. Eux . 10 . 4 , Dioskouris was founded by Miletos (no. 854 ) (Tsetskhladze ( 1998 b ) 16 -19 ), and modern writers suppose it to date to C6m. Other writers relate foundation myths set in the epic period and which are poetic in nature (App. Mithr . 101 ; Luc. 3 . 3 . 269 ; Paus. 3 . 19 . 7 , 24 . 7 ; cf. Braund ( 1994 ) 31 -33 ). The chora of the city spread up to a 10 km radius around the city. Eshera, the largest settlement in the area, was probably part of the chora . Finds of helmets may mark the edge of the chora of Dioskouris: the local population of northeastern Kolchis was engaged in piracy and used to attack the coastal cities including Dioskouris (Diod. 20 . 25 ; Strabo 11 . 2 . 12 , 16 , 19 , 11 . 3 . 6 ; Plin. HN 6 . 15 -16 ; cf. Shamba ( 1980 ); Voronov ( 1991 ); Tsetskhladze ( 1998 a ) 15 -25 ). There has been no large-scale archaeological investigation of the city (modern-day Sukhumi in Abkhazia, northwestern Georgia).Part of the city site is under water, and the remainder is covered by the modern city.Rescue excavations demonstrate that the city had monumental stone buildings from at least C4 . Material shedding light on the early history of the city has not been found apart from a few fragments of C6l-C5 pottery and a Greek marble burial stele dated to 430 -420 (Lordkipanidze ( 1968 ); Voronov ( 1980 ); Nikonov ( 1996 ); Tsetskhladze ( 1998 a ) 15 -25 ). The patron deities seem to have been the Dioskouroi (inference from the toponym). Another communal cult was that of Demeter (Tsetskhladze ( 1998 a ) 16 -17 )."

The toponym is Γυηνός (Ps.-Skylax 81 ); possibly Cycnus in Pompon. 1 . 110 (Inadze ( 1968 ) 124 ; Lordkipanidze ( 1979 ) 130 -31 ; Shamba ( 1988 ) 6 ; Braund ( 1994 ) 103 ; Tsetskhladze ( 1998 a ) 12 -13 ). It was situated in Kolchis, eastern Black Sea (Ps.-Skylax 81 ). Gyenos is called a polis Hel by Ps.-Skylax 81 , using polis in the urban sense. Gyenos was settled by some east Greeks including merchants in C6m (Tsetskhladze ( 1998 a ) 12 -15 ). Pompon. 1 . 110 relates the city's foundation myth (Braund ( 1994 ) 103 ). Gyenos was probably a mixed Hellenic-barbarian polis : material culture shows both Greek and local Kolchian features (Shamba ( 1988 ); Tsetskhladze ( 1998 a ) 12 -15 ). Ancient Gyenos has been located in an area near the modern city of Ochamchire (Abkhazia,north-western Georgia). According to the survey carried out on the site of the supposed ancient city, its area measured 65 ha (Shamba ( 1988 ) 7 ). It is difficult to accept this because of doubts as to the actual location and the very poor preservation of the site itself. The settlement ranged across three artificial hills and the surrounding plain on the left bank of the river Dzhikimur where it joins the sea. Only the edge of one hill (C) has been partly excavated; the other two hills have been completely destroyed by modern construction work. Two Archaic wooden dwellings have been well preserved. They had straw roofs. In the Archaic level East Greek pottery accounts for 28 . 5 per cent of the total pottery finds. By C4e habitation on hill C came to an end and was replaced with burials of horses' heads, equipped in Skythian fashion (Shamba ( 1988 ))."
711,Phasis (Phasianos),The Black Sea Area,42.05,41.45,600,3058,"711 . Phasis (Phasianos) Map 87 . Lat. 42 . 05 , long. 41 . 45 . Size of territory ? Type: A: β . The city was situated in Kolchis, eastern Black Sea (Ps.-Skylax 81 ; Strabo 11 . 2 . 17 , 12 . 3 . 17 ). The toponym is Φαtildeσις (Hdt. 4 . 86 . 2 ; SEG 44 1298 (C5l)). The city-ethnic is Φασιανός (Heracl. Lemb. 46 ). Phasis is called a polis Hel by Ps.-Skylax 81 , using polis in the urban sense; Hippoc. Aer . 15 calls Phasis an emporion . It had its own constitution, included in the Aristotelian corpus of 158 politeiai (Heracl. Lemb. 46 ; Arist. no. 141 , Gigon). The external and collective use of the city-ethnic Φασιανοί is attested at Xen. An . 5 . 6 . 36 -37 ; Heracl. Lemb. 46 ; cf. Hind ( 1996 b ) 209 -11 ; Braund ( 1994 ) 96 . Phasis is said to have been founded by Milesians (Heracl. Lemb. 46 ; Pompon. 1 . 108 ; Steph. Byz. 661 . 1 ), and some date the foundation to C6m, others to a much later date (Lordkipanidze ( 1985 ) 22 -34 ; Tsetskhladze ( 1998 a ) 7 -12 ). The oikistes ' name is given as Themistagoras of Miletos (Pompon. 1 . 108 ; cf. Steph. Byz. 661 . 1 : εκτίσθη δεgrave υasperποgrave Μιλησίων ), a name found both at Miletos (no. 854 ) and Sinope (no. 729 ). Phasis was probably a mixed Hellenic-barbarian polis (Tsetskhladze ( 1994 b ) 211 -12 ), and the emporion served merchants visiting there at least from C5l/C4e (Hippoc. Aer . 15 ; Hind ( 1996 b ) 209 -11 ). Lordkipanidze ( 2000 ) has restated the case for the existence of a Greek apoikia / polis at Phasis in the Archaic and Classical periods; however, his treatment of the literary evidence is uneven, and that of Herodotos incorrect. The discussion of the Kolchian/Phasian coin types is also selective and unconvincing; see further Hind ( 2002 ). Phasis has not been located. According to Arrian, the old fortifications of Phasis consisted of an earth rampart with wooden towers, in the Roman period replaced with walls of burnt brick (Arr. Peripl. M. Eux . 9 ). The patron deity seems to have been Apollo Hegemon ( SEG 44 1298 (C5l); Tsetskhladze ( 1994 b )). Late writers mention the goddess of Phasis (Rhea or Artemis?) (Arr. Peripl. M. Eux . 9 ; Zos. Historia Nova 1 . 28 ). Literary and epigraphic evidence suggest that temples to these deities existed in the city (Zubov inscription on phiale (C5l); Tsetskhladze ( 1994 b ); Arr. Peripl. M. Eux . 9 ; Zos. Historia Nova 1 . 28 ). It has been suggested that silver coins 'Kolkhidki' (Dundua ( 1987 ) 9 -32 ) were minted by Phasis or the Phasians between C5e and C3 . T etradrachms have on obv . lion's head which may derive from the lion of Miletos (no. 854 ). A small percentage of type B hemidrachms are inscribed with Greek letters (initials for the names of magistrates?; cf. Dundua ( 1987 ) 9 -32 ; Tsetskhladze ( 1993 ) 236 -40 ; Hind ( 1996 b ) 204 -9 ). Hind studied the exceptional variety of C5m-l coin types, and suggested that Milesian die-makers may have been working for the Phasian skeptouchoi in Kolchis (Hind ( 1996 b ) 204 -9 ). ## 4 .

Hist. an . 554 b 15 ), to which corresponds the city-ethnic Α µ ισηνός ( SEG 28 725 ( c. 300 )); the city was renamed Πειραιευacuteς in C5s (Strabo 12 . 3 . 14 ; cf. infra ); the corresponding city-ethnic Πειραευacuteς or Πειραιευacuteς is found in a C4 inscription from Pantikapaion ( CIRB 1 = Syll . ³ 217 ; note, however, that LGPN ii ∆ιονυacuteσιος no. 622 treats this man as an Athenian from the deme of Peiraieus) and on coins (Head, HN ² 496 ; Malloy ( 1970 )); it reverted to its former name by C3e. The territory was size 5 by Heltic times; earlier probably much smaller. According to Ps.-Skymnos 957 , Diller, Amisos was an apoikia of the Phokaians (no. 859 ), hence probably a polis in the political sense (date retrospectively given as c. 560 ); Theopomp. fr. 389 apud Strabo 12 . 3 . 14 considered it a Milesian foundation originally. Probably c. 436 , in connection with the Pontic expedition of Perikles (Plut. Per . 20 ), it received a contingent of Athenian settlers led by Athenokles, and its name was changed to Peiraieus (Theopomp. fr. 389 : υasperπ ' Αθηνοκλέους καιgrave Αθηναίων εποικισθεῖσαν Πειραιαtilde µ ετονο µ ασθηtildeναι ; cf. infra and Sinope (no. 729 )). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic Peira(i)eus is found on C4 coins ( infra ). The external individual use of the city-ethnic Amisenos is found in CIRB 249 -50 (C4l/C3e); SEG 28 725 ( c. 300 ); and IG ii² 8062 , 8072 (C3 ); this use of Peiraeus is found in CIRB 1 = Syll . ³ 217 , a C4m record of a proxenos of Pantikapaion (no. 705 ). The external collective use of the city-ethnic is not attested until the Heltic period (e.g. Strabo 12 . 3 . 13 ). The chora of Amisos included Saramene,and reached the river Halys to the west, and Themiskyra and Sidene to the east.The native peoples were variously known as Syroi (Hdt. 2 . 104 ), Assyrioi (Ps.-Skylax 89 ), Leukosyroi (Ps.-Skymnos 956 , Diller; Strabo 12 . 3 . 12 , 25 ) or Kappadokes (Strabo 12 . 3 . 9 ). Amisos (present-day Samsun) lies 165 km east of Sinope (no. 729 ), on the flat top and eastern slopes of a plateau headland (Kara, Eski Samsun) to the west of the town of Samsun (Maximova ( 1956 ) 52 -54 ; Atasoy ( 1997 ) 25 ff). It possessed no fine natural harbour; nor was it near the mouth of any major river (Wilson ( 1976 a )). Its main assets were the 'Amisene' iron, probably traded from the Chalybes (Arist. Mir. ausc . 833 b 33 ), its lands productive of olives (Strabo 2 . 1 . 15 , 12 . 3 . 30 ), some local silver from the Pontic Mountains, and the overland route across the so-called isthmus of Asia which led to Tarsos via Amaseia, Zela and Kaisareia (Hdt. 1 . 72 , 2 . 33 ; Ps.-Skymnos 961 -62 , Diller; Strabo 12 . 1 . 3 ). The sea routes along the coast and across the Euxine to the mouth of the Danube,southern Crimea and the Kimmerian Bosporos were largely in the sphere of Sinope. It has been supposed that Amisos was in competition with Sinope (Magie ( 1950 ) 184 ), though it was probably not powerful enough to be so down to the end of the Classical period. Maximova ( 1956 ) 82 -83 sees it as having, rather, a junior collaborative role. Two points tend to uphold this view. First, the colonisation by Athenokles and the party of Athenians at Amisos (Theopomp.fr. 389 apud Strabo 12 . 3 . 14 ) may well have taken place at about the same time and in the same sort of circumstances as Perikles' reported intervention at Sinope and dispatch of 600 colonists there (Plut. Per . 20 ). Secondly, the silver coinage of both cities displays somewhat similar reverse types (birds of prey with outstretched wings). The smaller denominations of Sinope in particular have their eagle en face with outstretched wings,as though to acknowledge the facing owl of Amisos. From the time of the Athenian settlement, democracy lasted for a while until the Persians gained Amisos (App. Mith . 83 ; Polyaen. 7 . 21 . 1 ). The satrap Datames had designs on it, wishing to use it as a mint (Polyaen. 7 . 21 . 1 ), c. 370 . From C3m it lost its autonomy and became part of the Pontic kingdom under Mithridates II or Ariobarzanes. There have been no planned excavations at Kara Samsun (Atasoy ( 1997 ) 109 ), the plateau being occupied by an American radar station. In the nineteenth and early part of the twentieth century, activity in the cemetery brought to light much jewellery, some of C5 -C4 (Marshall ( 1911 ) pl. 31 nos. 1706 , 1808 , 1816 ), a grave stele of C4 (Mendel ( 1912 ) no. 7 ), a bronze decoration from below the handle of a C4 hydria (Wiegand ( 1923 ); Züchner ( 1942 ) 175 ). There is also a small amount of imported pottery of C6 -C4 (Atasoy ( 1997 ) 39 ). Contacts with Greek cities in the form of Amisenes abroad in the Classical and Heltic periods spread fairly widely (Maximova ( 1956 ) 89 ; Debord ( 1990 ); Atasoy ( 1997 ) 86 ). About 18 km south-west of Samsun is Ak Alan, a fortified hill-top settlement, probably the centre of a Kappadokian chieftain. Here were found, in addition to native pottery, some terracotta architectural ornaments ( simae , friezes) in a north Ionic or Aiolic Greek style, and pottery fragments from one or more Wild Goat style oinochoai of c. 625 -600 (Macridy ( 1907 ); Cummer ( 1976 )). These early contacts of Greeks with the Kappadokians and knowledge of the route to Tarsos were, perhaps, initiated by Milesians from Sinope even before the foundation of Amisos. Hdt. 1 . 76 -78 mentions Pteria, the strongest place, east of the river Halys, where the major battle between Kroisos and Kyros took place. This site is said to have been inland, on a line with Sinope on the Black Sea. Some have sought to identify Pteria with Ak Alan, but Pteria is now persuasively argued to have been at the huge IA fortification at Kerkenes Da˘ g (Mitchell ( 1999 ) 187 -88 ). Some Greeks (Hecat. fr. 199 ; Zenodotos apud Strabo 12 . 3 . 25 ) took Amisos to be the Enete of Hom. Il . 2 . 352 , and there is also the connection of Themiskyra and the Thermodon area with 'Amazons' (tale of the origin of the Sarmatians, Hdt. 4 . 110 ). These 'barbarians' of legend may reflect a historical situation, which kept out Greek colonists until a relatively late date. The foundation story, as given by Ps.-Skymnos ( 956 -57 , Diller) makes Amisos a Phokaian αποικία . . . ' Ιωνικηgrave κτίσις , which was founded 4 years before Herakleia (no. 715 ). In the defective line ( 957 ), there may be room for 'Milesians and' as well as 'Phokaians'; Theopompos ( apud Strabo 12 . 3 . 4 ) mentions 'Milesians' , then occurs a break in the text, leading to 'Kappadokians' , and 'Athenokles and the Athenians'(Lasserre ( 1978 ); Descat ( 1990 ) 540 ). However these variants in the two texts and the vicissitudes in the events of the ktisissage are to be explained, Amisos was clearly a polis in the political sense from c. 564 , though perhaps a polis dependent on Sinope, and briefly, from c. 436 , on Athens. No colonies of Amisos are known. Sinope seems to have monopolised that practice in the region. Amisos struck silver coins on the Persian standard from C5l to c. 330 . Types: obv . head of nymph, or Hera in stephane or turreted crown; rev . owl facing with wings outstretched, standing on shield; legend: ΠΕΙΡΑ or ΠΕΙΡΑΙ or ΠΕΙΡΑΕ or ΠΕΙΡΑΙΩΝ . The trading activity of Peiraieus can be traced through finds of these coins singly and in hoards ( IGCH 395 ) in Asia (Newell ( 1931 )) and on the Black Sea shores (Maximova ( 1956 ) 89 ; Malloy ( 1970 ); Atasoy ( 1997 ) 86 ; Head, HN ² 496 ; Price ( 1993 ) pls.

The toponym is ' Ηράκλεια , ηasper ( I.Sinope 1 . 3 ( 353 / 2 -346 / 5 ); Xen. An . 5 . 6 . 10 ; Arist. Pol . 1306 a 37 ), to which is often added ηasper εν τΩsubiotaῶ ΠόντΩsubiotaω (e.g. Arist. Mete . 367 a ); Ποντιαgraveς ' Ηράκλεια is found in the epigram in IG vii 2531 (C4 ). The full name appears on the reverses of the earliest coins of C5l/C4e (Price ( 1993 ) pl. LVII). The city-ethnic is ' Ηρακλε ( ι ) ώτης (Xen. An . 6 . 4 . 23 ; C4l coins; CID ii 4 . iii . 17 , etc.). Herakleia is called polis in the urban sense at Xen. An . 6 . 2 . 1 , 18 and Ps.-Skylax 91 , and in the political sense at Xen. An . 5 . 6 . 21 ; Aen. Tact. 12 . 5 ; and Arist. Pol . 1327 b 14 . Polites occurs at Isoc. Ep . 7 . 2 , and patris is found in IG vii 2531 (C4 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally on C4l coins ( infra ), and externally in Xen. An . 5 . 6 . 19 ; Aen. Tact. 12 . 5 ; and IG i³ 71 . iv . 127 ( 425 / 4 ). The individual and external use is found in IG i³ 74 ( 424 / 3 ) and IG ii² 408 ( c. 330 ), Dem. 52 . 6 and I.Olbia 6 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 20 (C4s). The chora (mentioned in I.Sinope 1 . 4 ( 353 / 2 -346 / 5 )) ' Ηρακλεῶτις (Thuc. 4 . 75 . 2 ; Xen. An . 6 . 2 . 19 )-described as situated εν τηsubiotaηtilde Μαριανδυνῶν χώρΩsubiotaα , Xen. An . 6 . 2 . 1 -in C5stretched to the Kales and to the river Kallichoros to the west, and to the south-east to the area between the rivers Lykos and Billaios. Eventually, Herakleia's coastal influence reached out westwards beyond the river Hypios to the major river Sangarios, via an emporion at Elaious, and beyond it to Thynias Island (Dörner and Hoepfner ( 1962 ) 583 -93 ; Hoepfner ( 1966 ) 19 ; Burstein ( 1976 )). The city was strategically situated one long day's sail ( 210 km) from the entrance to the Pontos (Xen. An . 6 . 4 . 2 ), with no city in that direction, only an uninhabited peninsula, Kalpe, which Xenophon fleetingly hoped to colonise, at the halfway stage (Xen. An . 6 . 3 . 1 , 4 . 1 . 6 ). T o the east was Sinope (no. 729 ), almost twice the distance (two days' sail and 350 km; Xen. An . 6 . 2 . 1 ), but Cape Karambis, and the shortest crossing of the Pontos, lay between. Nearer to Herakleia lay four minor Milesian poleis or katoikiai , in one case an emporion of Sinope (see Tieion (no. 733 ), Kromna (no. 723 ), Sesamos (no. 728 ) and Kytoros (no. 724 )). None of these could be much of a threat to Herakleia until they were synoecised under the name Amastris c. 300 -290 (see Sesamos (no. 728 )). Herakleia, however, was well placed to let or hinder shipping from outside the Black Sea,going west or east along its southern shore,and across it to, or from, the Crimea and South Russia. The isolated statement of Strabo 12 . 3 . 4 that Herakleia was a Milesian colony is an error ( contra Asheri ( 1972 ) 14 ), compounded by attributing the first subjection of the Mariandynoi to them and ignoring Megarians totally. All other sources attribute the settlement of Herakleia to Megara (no. 225 ) (Xen. An . 6 . 2 . 11 ) or to Megarians with Boiotian participation (Ps.-Skymnos 1016 -17 , Diller; Ephor. fr. 44 b). According to Ap. Rhod. 2 . 846 , Nisaioi (i.e. from east coast Megara) were the colonists along with Boiotians.Paus. 5 . 26 . 7 says the Boiotians were from Tanagra (no. 220 ), an important coastal state in C6 (Buck ( 1979 ) 99 ). Suda s.v . ' Ηρακλείδης Ευacuteφρονος , makes them Thebans (no. 221 ). The oikistes was Gnesiochos, a Megarian (Euphorion fr. 90 , Scheidewin; Ephor. fr. 44 b; Collectanea Alexandrina (Oxford, 1925 ) fr. 177 ). It has also been suggested that Thessalians took part (Asheri ( 1972 ) 14 ). The Boiotians' plight, leading to their sending out colonists after two oracles from Delphi, was due to plague and to Phokian raids (Just. Epit . 16 . 3 . 8 ). The foundation date is given by correlation with Persian/Median history, 'the Boiotians and Megarians founded it ( κτίζουσι ) within the Kyaneai Rocks about the time when Kyros captured Media' (Ps.-Skymnos 1017 -19 , Diller). This ought to mean c. 550 , at any rate before the collapse of Lydia in 547 ; Megara's reason was pressure from Athens (Hind ( 1998 ) 134 ). Local historians of Herakleia were concerned to give their city a 'pre-history'-a connection with Herakles, or with the Argonaut Idmon, or with a Mariandynian hero, Agamestor (Herodoros ( FGrHist 31 ) fr. 51 ; Nymphis ( FGrHist 432 ) fr. 3 ; Promathidas ( FGrHist 430 ) fr. 3 ). Agamestor (or Idmon) was poliouchos , with an old olive tree in his honour on show in the agora (Ap. Rhod. 2 . 841 -50 ). At least in Roman times Herakles was claimed as ktistes on coins (Head, HN ² 516 ). The celebration of Dionysia is attested in Diod. 16 . 36 . 3 (r 353 ). Herakleia founded colonies across the Pontos at Kallatis (no. 686 ) and Chersonesos (no. 695 ) perhaps during the troubles of C5l/C4e, though some date them to C6l or C5e (Hind ( 1998 ) 139 -52 ; Saprykin ( 1998 ) 236 ; Ivantchik ( 1998 ) 322 n. 77 ). Her wars with Bosporos ensued c. 390 -370 (Burstein ( 1974 ); Hind ( 1994 ) 498 ). A small settlement of Herakleiots also existed on Thynias Island ( νηtildeσος Θυνιαgraveς ( οικουtildeσι δεgrave αυτηgraveν ' Ηρακλεῶται ), Ps.-Skylax 92 ; ' Ηρακλεωτῶν άποικος , Ps.-Skymnos 1026 , Diller) towards the entrance to the Black Sea. This island is called Apollonia and Daphnousia by writers of Roman date, and the Herakleiot settlement is named Thunias (Plin. HN 6 . 32 ; Ptol. Geog . 5 . 1 . 3 ; Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 18 ). A number of early wars with the local population are referred to at Just. Epit . 16 . 3 . 7 -8 ; the citizen levy is referred to at Polyaen. 2 . 30 . 3 . According to Arist. Pol . 1327 b 14 -15 , the Herakleiots entertained a large navy ( πολλαgraveς εκπληρουtildeσι τριήρεις ; cf. Polyaen. 6 . 9 . 4 ), and Arist. Oec . 1347 b 3 refers to a navy of forty ships (rC4f); Aen. Tact. 12 . 5 attests to the hiring of a substantial mercenary army by the city. Strategoi are referred to at Arist. Oec . 1347 b 13 (rC4f). In C5m Athens sought to make Herakleia a tribute-paying city, and the city's name appears more reliably than most in the tribute assessment decree of 425 / 4 : [h ερ ] ακλει ˜ οτα [ ι ] ( IG i³ 71 . iv . 127 ). Athens' general, Lamachos, seems to have been attempting to assert her control over the near region when he lost his contingent of ships in a flash-flood in the river Kales (Thuc. 4 . 75 . 2 ).At this time,in general,some leaders at Herakleia seem to have favoured dependence on Persia and declined to pay a monetary contribution to Athens (Just. Epit . 16 . 2 . 8 ). Others were prepared to help the stranded Athenians out of trouble on this or a later occasion (e.g. Sotimos, A. B. West ( 1935 ) 74 -75 ; cf. IG i³ 74 ( 424 / 3 )). After the passing of Athens' brief hegemony in (at least parts of) the Pontos, Herakleia continued to be in a position to interfere with shipping going between Bosporos and the Aegean (e.g. in 360 and 330 ; cf. IG ii² 117 . 20 -23 , 360 . 35 -40 ). On the other hand, Herakleiot merchants were honoured at Athens for services rendered ( IG ii² 408 ). Politically Herakleia is said to have been a 'democracy' (Arist. Pol . 1304 b 31 -34 ; Aen. Tact. 11 . 10 ; cf. E. W. Robinson ( 1997 ) 111 -13 )-perhaps rather a settlement of relatively poor allotment-holders led by an oikistes together with a group of refugees from Boiotia (Just. Epit . 16 . 3 ). Passage of time, growth, prosperity, war with, and subjection of, the local people, Mariandynoi, brought inequalities, and these led to stasis (Burstein ( 1976 ); Saprykin ( 1981 ); Gehrke, Stasis 70 -72 ). There were perhaps two leaders described as 'tyrants' (Eurytion, Arist. Pol . 1306 a 39 -40 ; Euopios, Suda s.v. Κλεάρχος ). The nobles were driven out by 'demagogues' , but returned to overthrow the 'many' (Arist. Pol . 1304 b 31 -33 ). The oligarchic restriction of citizenship to heads of families was apparently dropped, and the number of those having full privileges under the oligarchy was raised to 600 in C5l (Arist. Pol . 1305 b 2 -13 ). These troubles probably occupied the late C5 and early decades of C4 (civic unrest are also referred to by Aen. Tact. 11 . 10 , 12 . 5 ). In 364 Klearchos founded a 'tyrant' dynasty that lasted more than 70 years: Klearchos ( 364 -c. 353 / 2 ); Satyros ( c. 353 / 2 -345 ); Timotheos ( c. 345 -337 ); Dionysios ( 345 -305 ); Amastris, wife of Dionysios, later of Lysimachos ( 305 -290 ) (Apel ( 1910 ); Burstein ( 1972 ), ( 1976 ); Frolov ( 1974 ); Saprykin ( 1997 )). I.Sinope 1 ( 353 / 2 -346 / 5 ) is a treaty of symmachia between,on the one hand, Sinope (no. 729 ) and, on the other, 'Satyros and the sons of Klearchos' . It is a mutual defensive pact by which both contracting parties undertake to support the other in case of attack on the territory or on the city, excepting aggression by the Great King or aggression by a third party sanctioned by the Great King: such aggression is to be negotiated by envoys sent to the king by the parties involved; if the aggressor is unwilling to conduct such negotiations, then he may be attacked by the two contracting parties who thus explicitly recognise the suzerainty of the Great King. The poleis of Kromna (no. 723 ) and Sesamos (no. 728 ) may, if they wish, be included in the alliance. In addition to such alliance arrangements,the treaty includes stipulations to the effect that (a) Sinopean and Herakleian exiles may remain εν ταῖς πόλεσ [ ι ]; it is, however, not clear exactly what is meant here: it may mean that Herakleian exiles are allowed to remain at Sinope, and vice versa; or it may mean that exiles are allowed to remain in any polis to which they had fled (as suggested by the editor); this would imply that Herakleia and Sinope could conclude a treaty whose stipulations were valid for other (dependent) poleis , and in fact Sinope is known to have ruled its colonies as dependent poleis (Gschnitzer ( 1958 ) 18 -19 ; Nielsen ( 2000 ) 135 ; cf. Kerasous (no. 719 ), Kotyora (no. 722 ), and Trapezous (no. 734 )); (b) that full support is to be given in the case of attempts to overthrow the existing constitutions of Sinope and Herakleia. Pace Jacoby ( FGrHist iii 435 p. 368 ) and Gigon, fr. 501 . 56 , there is no direct evidence that the politeia of Herakleia was described by Aristotle. Magistrates: basileus and aisymnatai are assumed for Herakleia, as derivative offices are known at her colonies, Kallatis (no. 686 ) and Chersonesos (no. 695 ) (Hanell ( 1934 ) 12 ff, 135 ff). The council was of 300 members (Polyaen. 2 . 302 ). The calendar was Megarian, like those of Byzantion (no. 674 ), Kallatis (no. 686 ) and Chersonesos (no. 695 ) (Avram ( 1999 b ); Trümpy, Monat . 150 ). Nomophylakes and prodikoi , from their presence at Chersonesos ( IOSPE i² 342 , 343 , 359 ), are assumed to have existed also at Herakleia. Agoranomoi are taken to be represented on amphora stamps ( infra ). Dikasteria are attested during the democracy of C5l (Arist. Pol . 1305 b 34 ). Relations with other poleis are attested in IG i³ 74 ( 424 / 3 ), a grant of proxeny by Athens (no. 361 ) to Sotimos of Herakleia; a C4 proxenos at Athens is attested by Dem. 52 . 5 and IG ii² 408 ( c. 330 ) is an honorific decree for two Herakleiots. A proxenos at Argos (no. 347 ) is attested by Dem. 52 . 10 . IG ii² 117 . 19 -22 and 360 . 35 ff record Athenian decisions to send envoys to Herakleia. Herakleia entered into negotiations with Xenophon's army ( An . 5 . 6 . 21 , 6 . 2 . 7 ) and was of logistic assistance in various ways ( An . 5 . 6 . 35 , 6 . 2 . 3 ) though relations were uneasy ( An . 6 . 2 . 8 ). The citizens were divided into the three Doric tribes, and each tribe seems to have been subdivided into four hekatostyes (making a total of twelve) until a politically motivated increase to sixty hekatostyes gave the democratic faction greater political participation (Aen. Tact. 11 . 10 ). For alternative interpretations of the two-tier system, see Jones, POAG 281 -83 . At this stage the adult male citizen population can be accepted at some 6 , 000 (Beloch apud Burstein ( 1976 ) 115 n. 61 ). The native Mariandynoi are said to have ceded some of the territory to the colonists in return for support against the neighbouring Kaukones, and then to have lost more in warfare against their protectors. In 480 they were still an independent tribe, sending troops to Xerxes as their overlord (Hdt. 3 . 90 , 7 . 72 ). Later they were in group subjection to the Herakleiots, tied to the land and bound to row in the fleet, but safe from sale overseas (Strabo 12 . 3 . 4 ). Different terms are used, and two groups of dependants may be intended, perioikoi and georgountes (Arist. Pol . 1327 b 11 -12 ), and a third, dorophoroi , indicating tributary status (Poll. 3 . 83 ). The class was a famous case of Dorian subjection of men within their state (Arist. Pol . 1327 b 11 -15 ; Paus. 5 . 26 . 7 ; Ath. 6 . 263 C-D). It brought prosperity, but also political strains and excesses (Just. Epit . 16 . 3 . 8 ; Frolov ( 1981 ); Saprykin ( 1981 ); Avram ( 1984 )). Products of the area were tunny fish, walnuts and timber, but especially wine and the associated pottery products (trade amphoras). The trade amphoras of Herakleia are found widely in the Black Sea area, characterised by socalled englyphic stamps. They are numerous on sites of c. 400 through C4 and beyond (Grakov ( 1926 ); Balabanov ( 1982 ); Brashinskij ( 1984 )). The cross-Pontic interests of Herakleia show up in the C4 proxeny decrees at Olbia (no. 690 ) ( I.Olbia 2 and 6 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 20 ) and grave stelai at Nymphaion on the Bosporos ( CIRB 923 , 925 ). Influence of Herakleia has been detected on the coin types of Theodosia (no. 707 ), Phanagoria (no. 706 ) and the Sindoi ( Sindikos Limen ), and also on those of her own colonies, Chersonesos (no. 695 ) and Kallatis (no. 686 ), these types being a butting bull and the head or the club of Herakles. By C5s Herakleia was a fortified city (Xen. An . 6 . 2 . 8 ); at Themistius 20 . 239 c, Dindorff, is a reference to a proasteion where the C4 Athenian politician Anytos was buried; Theopomp. fr. 181 refers to private houses. Diog. Laert. 5 . 91 has a reference to a theatre in a C4 context, and Polyaen. 2 . 30 . 2 has one to a bouleuterion during Klearchos' rule ( 364 -352 ) (cf. Hansen and Fischer-Hansen ( 1994 ) 39 ). The town was grid-planned, perhaps already in the Classical period (Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1986 ) 3 -4 ), but there are few archaeological traces of the Classical period at Herakleia: a late Archaic head in east Greek style (Akurgal ( 1986 )), and coins of the tyrant dynasty (Franke ( 1966 )). But Herakleiots commissioned several works in Greek sanctuaries, a statue group of Herakles' deeds, to commemorate the repulse of the native Mariandynoi, at Olympia (Paus. 5 . 26 . 7 ), and a statue of Apollo at Delphi (Paus. 10 . 51 . 1 ). Herakleia possessed no natural harbour or major river estuary, but a bay with a projecting headland (Baba burun) to the north-east. Ancient moles, perhaps Heltic and Roman, improved protection for shipping (LehmannHartleben ( 1923 ) 13 ; Wilson ( 1976 b )). The headland was Acherousias, where the small river Acheron (Soonautes) flowed and was said to descend deep into Hades (Xen. An . 6 . 2 . 2 ). Beyond the bay to the south-west, some 5 km distant, was the river Lykos,and further again at 15 km the small river Kales, scene of the Athenian naval losses and an emporion of the Herakleiotai (Dörner and Hoepfner ( 1962 ) 579 ). Herakleiot silver coinage (on a standard similar to the Aiginetan used at Sinope (no. 729 )) began in C5l. Denominations: tetradrachm, drachm, hemidrachm, tetrobol, diobol, obol. Types: ( 1 ) obv . Herakles wrestling with lion; rev . quartered square; legend: ΗΡΑΚ or ΗΡΑΚΛΕΙΑ ; ( 2 ) Obv . head of Herakles; rev . bull butting; legend: ΗΡΑΚ or ΗΡΑΚΛΕΙΑ ; ( 3 ) Obv . same; rev . club; legend: ΗΡΑΚ or ΗΡΑΚΛΕΙΑ . ( 4 ) Obv . same; rev . head of Hera wearing stephane ; legend: ΗΡΑΚ or ΗΡΑΚΛΕΙΑ . A change of type occurs with Timotheos and Dionysios ( c. 345 ). Obv . head of Dionysos with thyrsos; rev .

719,Kerasous (Kerasountios),The Black Sea Area,40.55,38.2,516,2432,"719 . Kerasous (Kerasountios) Map 87 . Lat. 40 . 55 , long. 38 . 20 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: α . The toponym is Κερασουtildeς (Xen. An . 5 . 3 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 89 ). The city-ethnic is Κερασουacuteντιος (Xen. An . 5 . 7 . 17 ). Kerasous is called polis in the urban sense at Xen. An . 5 . 3 . 2 and Ps.-Skylax 89 (cf. Diod. 14 . 30 . 5 ); it was certainly also a polis in the political sense: the collective use of the cityethnic is found several times in Xen. An . ( 5 . 5 . 10 , 7 . 13 , 20 , 22 , 24 , 31 ); like Trapezous (no. 734 ) (Xen. An . 4 . 8 . 22 ) and Kotyora (no. 722 ) (Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 3 ), it is described as a colony of Sinope (no. 729 ), and since both Trapezous (Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 15 ) and Kotyora (Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 7 ) were poleis in the political sense,so should Kerasous be.Finally,both Trapezous and Kotyora paid tribute to Sinope, and so did Kerasous (Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 10 ); the inference is that Kerasous was a polis in the political sense, though, like Trapezous and Kotyora, it must have been a dependent polis , i.e. a colony dependent on its metropolis (Hansen ( 1997 b ) 33 ; Nielsen ( 2000 ) 135 ). Kerasous was situated among the Kolchoi, some 3 days' march west of Trapezous (Xen. An . 5 . 3 . 2 , 7 . 13 -30 ). The army of Xenophon's men in retreat from Kounaxa ( 400 ) was counted there, 8 , 600 remaining. They stayed at the city and used an external market for 10 days, but then caused disturbance and offence when leaving. The city was a colony and dependency of Sinope ( supra ), which had driven the natives out and protected the citizens, who in turn paid a tax ( δασ µ ός , Xen. An . 5 . 3 . 2 , 10 ). During Athens'brief exercise of sea power in the Black Sea, Kerasous was probably, along with Apollonia (no. 682 ) and Herakleia (no. 715 ), a tributepaying member of the Euxine section of the Delian League ( Κερ [ ασός ] in IG i³ 71 . iv . 169 , one of the more plausible restorations in the assessment list of 425 / 4 ). The Classical site was probably at Fol Bazar (Giresun Dere Su). Pharnakes I of Pontos moved the population to a new site at Pharnakia, which was perhaps previously called Choirades,near the Isle of Ares (Kerasun Ada).Ps.-Skylax 86 calls this Choirades a polis Hel . A Kerasous is placed by Ps.-Skylax 89 west of Sinope, but this appears to be a misplaced reference to the Kerasous east of Sinope, i.e. the present one, perhaps to be located at Fol Bazar."

An . 5 . 5 . 3 ), spelled Κυacuteτωρος by Strabo 12 . 3 . 17 , probably in confusion with Κυacuteτωρον west of Sinope. The city-ethnic is Κοτυωρίτης (Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 10 ). Kotyora is called a polis in the urban sense at Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 3 , 11 , and in the political sense at Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 7 . The cityethnic Κοτυωρίτης is repeatedly given in the plural by Xenophon (Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 10 ff). By C5l Kotyora had walls and could provide a market; private houses are mentioned at Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 11 . Kotyora excluded the troops of Xenophon's army because of their riotous behaviour on leaving the sister town Kerasous (no. 719 ) (Xen. An . 5 . 7 . 18 -30 ). The troops spent 45 days outside Kotyora, waiting for the merchants of Sinope and Herakleia to gather transport ships to take the army westward (Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 3 ). The territory of Kotyora is termed χώρα at Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 7 ; it was in the territory of the Tibarenoi (Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 3 ). The chora was apparently won for it by the Sinopeans, for which it paid a tax ( δασ µ ός ) to them, and was administered by a governor ( αasperρ µ οστής ) appointed by them (Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 10 , 20 ). It was a colony of Sinope (no. 729 ), and a dependency at least in C5l/C4e (Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 3 ). Kotyora (modern Ordu) lay 300 km east of Sinope. It was at least partially depopulated by Pharnakes I of Pontos to make up his new polis of Pharnakia in C2e. By the time of Strabo ( 12 . 3 . 17 ) it was a πολίχνη ."

Il . 2 . 855 , cf. Strabo 12 . 3 . 5 ); the legend ΚΡΩΜΝΑ is found on C4 coins.The city-ethnic is Κρω µ νίτης ( CIRB 199 (C4f); I.Sinope 1 . 24 ( 353 / 2 -346 / 5 )). According to Strabo 12 . 3 . 10 , Kromna was one of four katoikiai which were drawn into a now unified polis , Amastris, c. 300 -290 . The synoecised communities are called poleis and attributed to Miletos (no. 854 ) by Ps.Skymnos 1005 , Diller, probably referring to the time of foundation, which is, however, unknown. The external collective use of the city-ethnic is found in I.Sinope 1 . 24 ( 353 / 2 -346 / 5 ), and the external individual use in CIRB 199 (C4f), IG ii² 9094 ( 365 -340 ) and SEG 22 219 , though the latter two could conceivably refer to Lakedaimonian Kromnos (no. 334 ). Kromna lay at modern Korse-Silé between Sesamos and Tieion, and was the second most westerly of the four towns. See further the entries for Kytoros (no. 724 ), Sesamos (no. 728 ) and Tieion (no. 733 ). The treaty of symmachia between Sinope (no. 729 ) and 'Satyros and the sons of Klearchos' of Herakleia (no. 715 ) ( I.Sinope 1 . 23 -24 ( 353 / 2 -346 / 5 ), on which see 957 , 961 ) stipulates that the Kromnitans may, if they wish, be included in the alliance.

Hist. pl . 3 . 15 . 5 ) or Κυacuteτωρον , τό (Strabo 12 . 3 . 10 = Ephor. fr. 185 ). The city-ethnic is not attested in Greek, but appears in Latin as Cytorius (Catull. 4 . 11 ). Ps.-Skylax 90 calls Kytoros a polis Hel , but he is very lavish with this term ( supra 928 ). Strabo 12 . 3 . 10 describes it as one of four katoikiai , synoecised into one city at Amastris; this ought to have taken place c. 300 -290 . The synoecised communities are called poleis and attributed to Miletos (no. 854 ) by Ps.-Skymnos 1005 , Diller, probably referring to the time of foundation.According to Strabo 12 . 3 . 10 , Kytoros was once an emporion of Sinope (no. 729 ). Perhaps Kytoros was a polis in the urban sense depending on Sinope (Hansen ( 2000 ) 193 with n. 41 ). A major resource of the area was boxwood, perhaps also slaves,as it was an emporion . The town lay at modern Kidros, some 20 km west of Cape Karambis (the southern end of the shortest crossing of the Black Sea). It clearly lay athwart the coastal route to Sinope, but also that to the Crimea. See further the entries for Kromna (no. 723 ), Sesamos (no. 728 ) and Tieion (no. 733 )."

The cityethnic is Σησα µ ηνός ( I.Sinope 1 . 24 ( 353 / 2 -346 / 5 )). At Ps.-Skylax 90 , Sesamos is one of the many places labelled πόλις ' Ελληνίς (cf. 928 ). C. 300 -290 Sesamos became the centre of the newly synoecised city Amastris, which was formed by Queen Amastris, formerly wife of Dionysios of Herakleia and latterly wife of Lysimachos, out of four pre-existing katoikiai (Strabo 12 . 3 . 10 ). The synoecised communities are called poleis and attributed to Miletos (no. 854 ) by Ps.-Skymnos 1005 , Diller, probably referring to the time of foundation which is, however, unknown. The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found abbreviated on C4s coins ( infra ); the external collective use is found in I.Sinope 1 . 24 ( 353 / 2 -346 / 5 ). The treaty of symmachia between Sinope (no. 729 ) and 'Satyros and the sons of Klearchos' of Herakleia (no. 715 ) ( I.Sinope 1 . 23 -34 ( 353 / 2 -346 / 5 ), on which see 957 ) stipulates that the Sesamenes may, if they wish, be included in the alliance. Enmity between Sesamos and the Persian satrap Datames is alluded to at Polyaen. 7 . 21 . 2 . In Heltic and Roman times it became a large and beautiful city on a peninsula and with two harbours (Lehmann-Hartleben ( 1923 ) 13 -22 ; Wilson ( 1976 a )). The koinonia of C4l/C3e propelled the city into new prominence. It was near, but not on, the large river Parthenios, at the modern Turkish town of Amasra. See further Kromna (no. 723 ), Kytoros (no. 724 ) and Tieion (no. 733 ). Sesamos struck coins of silver and bronze in C4s. ( 1 ) Silver on the Rhodian standard: denominations: tetrobol, diobol.

729,Sinope (Sinopeus),The Black Sea Area,42.0,35.1,3336,17354,"729 . Sinope (Sinopeus) Map 87 . Lat. 42 . 00 , long. 35 . 10 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Σινώπη , ηasper ( I.Sinope 1 . 10 ( 353 / 2 -346 / 5 ); Hdt. 1 . 76 . 1 ; Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 7 ), Σινώπα in Doric ( I.Cos 20 . 21 (C4l)). The city-ethnic is Σινωπευacuteς ( I.Olbia 1 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 1 (C5f); I.Sinope 1 . 2 ; Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 8 ; Aen. Tact. 40 . 4 ). Sinope is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 4 . 12 . 2 ; Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 23 ; Ps.-Skylax 89 ) and in the political sense ( I.Sinope 5 . 5 (C4 ); Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 8 ). A C4l decree from Kos refers to the δαtilde µ ος οasper Σινωπέων ( I.Cos 20 ); cf. I.Sinope 3 = SEG 35 1356 (C4 ) which also grants politeia . Patris is found in AG Appendix Epigr. Sepulchr. 254 . 3 and patra in 709 . 5 . Sinope's politeia was among those described by Aristotle (Arist. fr. 599 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally in I.Sinope 1 . 2 ( 353 / 2 -346 / 5 ) and 5 . 4 -5 (C4 ) and may also be attested in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ); externally it is found at Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 8 , 13 ; Aen. Tact. 40 . 4 ; and I.Cos 20 (C4l). The external individual use of the city-ethnic is found in I.Olbia 1 (C5f); IG ii² 10327 (C4f), 10334 / 5 (C4m), 10343 (C4f), 10345 (C4f), etc.; I.Oropos 520 . 25 ( 329 -325 ); RPh 63 ( 1937 ) 325 -32 A. 14 (C4 , Chios); CIRB 208 (C4 , Pantikapaion), and SEG 28 725 ( c. 300 , Eretria). All are agreed that Sinope was a colony of Miletos (no. 854 ), but the complex foundation story is found in only one source (Ps.-Skymnos 981 -97 , Diller). This comes in four parts. First, an Amazon Sinope was its eponym (in some perhaps earlier versions Sinope was a nymph, daughter of Asopos). At this stage the Leukosyroi lived there, but they weredriven out by the Thessalian heroes Autolykos,Phlogios and Deileon, who had been followers of either Herakles against the Amazons (Plut. Luc . 23 ) or Jason (Strabo 12 . 3 . 11 ). Then Habron (Habrondas) came, a Milesian by birth, but seemingly he was killed by the Kimmerians. Then after the Kimmerians came Koos and Kretines, who were exiled from Miletos; these men jointly refounded it when the host of the Kimmerians overran Asia. The first stage is aetiological, attempting to explain a difficult name, which was perhaps Kappadokian, but ancients sought to link it with a Thracian origin in the meaning 'drunken' . The conversion of Sinope from nymph (Eumelos ( FGrHist 451 ) fr. 5 ) to Amazon was probably brought about by the absence of a significant river at Sinope and by the proximity of 'Amazon' country to the east. The episode of the Thessalian heroes was taken seriously at Sinope, where an oracle of Autolykos existed,and he was venerated as oikistes and a god (Strabo 12 . 3 . 11 ); but this was probably intended to lay down a claim for Sinope as a participant in Jason's voyage to Kolchis. A cult statue of Autolykos, the work of a C4sculptor, Sthennis, was carried off by Lucullus after he took the city. According to Plut. Luc . 23 , these heroes had taken the area from the Syroi. The two references to Milesian colonies (one brought to an end with the death of its oecist Habron/Habrondas, and the other a refoundation by Milesian exiles) have the look of genuine local tradition. The one may have taken place late in C8l or C7e, just before the Kimmerian irruption into Asia Minor, and the other in the last quarter of C7 , when the Kimmerians were already a much weakened force (Hind ( 1988 ); Ivantchik ( 1998 ) 326 -30 ). Ps.-Skymnos' account supplements in a very circumstantial way the brief comment in Hdt. 4 . 12 that the Kimmerians had settled where Sinope polis stood in his own day, and the summary of Strabo ( 12 . 1 . 11 ): 'the Milesians, seeing the natural advantages of the place and the weakness of its inhabitants, took possession of it, sending out further colonists' . The Eusebian date for Sinope ( Ol . 37 . 4 ) is a tabular form, giving misleading precision, of the information given in the local tradition and transmitted in the Heltic sources in the style given by Ps.-Skymnos (synchronisation with Near Eastern dynasties and events). Sinope herself founded at least three colonies on the 500 km stretch of coast eastwards among the Tibarenoi (Kotyora (no. 722 )), Chalybes (Kerasous (no. 719 )) and Kolchoi (Trapezous (no. 734 )), and had facilities for her traders still further east, probably at Pichvnari and Phasis (Tsetskhladze ( 1998 a ) 76 ff). Kytoros (no. 724 ) west of Sinope had at one stage been an emporion of Sinope (Strabo 12 . 3 . 10 ). This activity clearly contributed to the idea that Milesians founded no fewer than seventy-five (Sen. Helv . 7 . 2 ) or ninety colonies (Plin. HN 122 ), and appropriated to themselves the Black Sea and its approaches (Ath. 12 . 523 E). Daughter cities of Sinope clearly contributed considerably to these inflated lists. When Xenophon's troops sailed past Sinope to nearby Harmene in 400 , it was already a powerful city, could muster many ships (possession of a fleet is attested by Polyaen. 7 . 21 . 2 (rC4f)), and had three colonies on the coast eastward to Phasis (Xen. An . 4 . 8 . 22 , 5 . 3 . 2 , 5 . 4 -8 ). Xenophon adds that the Sinopeans were themselves colonists of the Milesians (Xen. An . 6 . 1 . 15 , followed by Diod. 14 . 31 . 2 , and confirmed by Strabo 12 . 3 . 11 ). 'Having built a naval port she ruled over the sea that side of the Kyaneoi Rocks and participated in many of the struggles of the Greeks even outside them' (i.e. outside the Euxine Sea), says Strabo 12 . 3 . 11 . Little is known of Sinope after the colonisation until c. C5m,when it was under a tyrant, Timesileos, who was driven out c. 436 by Athenian intervention under Perikles (Plut. Per . 20 ). A contingent of 600 men was sent there to consolidate Athenian influence and democracy, but it is likely to have departed from there by 405 if not by 411 / 10 , as the arche of Athens progressively crumbled (Tsetskhladze ( 1997 a )). One view is that Timesileos fled to Olbia (no. 690 ) and became tyrannos there for a time,but this rests on a very bold restoration of an inscription from Olbia (Y. G. Vinogradov ( 1989 ) 109 ff, ( 1997 ) 165 -94 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 5 ; contra Graham ( 1983 ); Yajlenko ( 1996 )). Sinope entered into negotiations with the army of Xenophon (Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 7 ) to protect its colony Kotyora (no. 722 ). Even in the period of her autonomy Sinope had occasionally to bow to the demands of the great power Persia; she probably was among those providing the thirty pentekonters for the satrap Ariaramnes to take across the Black Sea (before the expedition of Dareios into Skythia? Ktesias ( FGrHist 688 ) fr. 13 .( 20 )). Similarly some of the eighty ships from the Hellespont and Pontos will have been provided for Xerxes'fleet by Sinope (Diod. 11 . 3 . 8 ). I.Sinope 1 ( 353 / 2 -346 / 5 ) is a treaty of symmachia between, on the one hand, Sinope and, on the other, 'Satyros and the sons of Klearchos' , for which see further supra 957 , 959 . By the 370 s her maritime interests brought Sinope into conflict with Sestos (no. 672 ), which was perhaps interfering with her shipping on its way to the Aegean (Polyaen. 7 . 21 . 2 ), and towards the end of the century ( 309 -304 ) Eumelos of Bosporos was said to have greatly aided Sinope and Byzantion (no. 674 ) in their wider Black Sea interests (Diod. 20 . 25 ). Sinope increasingly came under threat from the peoples and rulers inland: Korylas (Xen. An . 5 . 6 . 8 ), Otis of the Paphlagonians ( Hell . 4 . 1 . 1 ; Ages . 3 . 4 ), and the Persian satrap Datames ( 384 -c. 362 ), who besieged the city (Polyaen. 7 . 21 . 2 , 5 ; cf. Aen. Tact. 40 . 4 ). The latter (with legends in Greek) and the satrap Ariobarzanes (in Aramaic lettering) issued silver coins of Sinopean type, showing by imitation her commercial success (Price ( 1993 ) pl. LIII; SNG Cop. Paphlagonia 290 ). The constitution was described in the lost Aristotelian Politeia (Arist. fr. 599 ). In C4 , it was a democracy: I.Sinope 1 . 27 -28 ( 353 / 2 -346 / 5 ) describes the constitution as demos = democracy, and I.Sinope 3 . 1 (C4 ) uses the enactment formula έδοξε τΩsubiotaῶ δή µ Ωsubiotaω . At least from the period of Athenian influence it had a boule and an ekklesia (D. Robinson ( 1905 ) no. 40 ); a bronze heliast's ticket has been found there, inscribed ∆ ΣΤΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ∆ΑΜΕΟΣ (Robert ( 1937 ) 296 ff no. 13 ). Magistrates were prytaneis and agoranomoi (Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 207 ); strategoi are mentioned as movers of a decree in I.Sinope 3 = SEG 35 1356 (C4 ). I.Sinope 7 (C4s) attests a nomophylakos and a boules epistates and grammateus . State cults typical of Miletos (no. 854 ) were Apollo Ietros, Delphinios (deduced from personal names (Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 142 , 144 )) and Poseidon Helikonios (ibid. 171 -72 ). Unique to Sinope was Zeus/Dis as a supposed prototype for Sarapis (Tac. Hist . 4 . 83 ), and the oracle cult of Autolykos, the legendary founder. He had a C4statue in the city made by Sthennis (Strabo 12 . 3 . 11 ), which was carried off by Lucullus. I.Sinope 7 (C4s) is a dedication by a board of prytaneis to Hestia Prytaneia (which presumably means that there was a prytaneion at Sinope). I.Sinope 5 (C4 ) is a grant of proxeny by Sinope to a citizen of Kos (no. 497 ); I.Sinope 3 is a fragmentary C4 grant of citizenship (and presumably other privileges) to a citizen of Kallatis (no. 686 ), and I.Sinope 6 (C4 ) likewise preserves a grant of citizenship; I.Sinope 4 (C4 ) is a fragmentary decree for an unknown man who in the preserved text is granted ατέλεια /asper εκατοgraveν στατήρων χρυσουtilde ('exemption from all taxes up to 100 gold staters' (editor)) as well as the right to enter and leave the harbour ασυλΕ καιgrave ασπονδΕ ('inviolably and without treaty'(editor)).A C5f proxeny decree for a Sinopean is known from Olbia (no. 690 ; I.Olbia 1 = Dubois ( 1996 ) 1 ), and a C4 grant is known from Chios ( RPh 63 ( 1937 ) 325 -33 A. 14 ). Burial stelai of Sinopeans of the period are well represented at Athens (Osborne and Byrne ( 1996 ) 289 -93 ), and one comes from Pantikapaion ( CIRB 208 ). A citizen of Sinope achieved a victory in the pankration at the Amphiaraia at Oropos in C4s ( IG vii 414 . 25 = I.Oropos 520 ( 329 / 8 or 325 / 4 ); SEG 30 1456 is a C5f bronze prize hydria from the Hekatombaian Games of Hera Argeia, found in a grave at Sinope, and suggests that a Sinopean was victorious in these games. The nearer chora of Sinope lay on the peninsula, which the ancients likened to a steering oar ( πηδάλιον , Plut. Luc . 23 ); some moderns have imagined that it resembles a boar's head (Maximova ( 1956 ) 32 n. 1 , quoting D. Robinson with approval). It is termed χώρα in I.Sinope 1 . 6 ( 353 / 2 -346 / 5 ) and at Xen. An . 5 . 6 . 11 , and called Σινωπικηgrave γηtilde (Strabo 3 . 2 . 6 ), while at Xen. An . 6 . 1 . 5 the toponym Σινώπη presumably designates the territory.Above the town were many garden allotments and suburbs, and the fertile peninsula's shores were protected by cliffs and sharp rock formations at and below sea level (Strabo 12 . 3 . 11 ). Her coastal region stretched westward to Harmene (walled townlet), which served as a harbour, at which to keep Xenophon's army quarantined from the city (Xen. An . 6 . 1 . 15 ), and eastward via Karousa to the river Halys. On the landward side Sinope seems to have been confined to the coastal strip, partly by the natural lay of the mountains, and partly by the Paphlagonian or Kappadokian (Pontic) kings. The resources from the coastal strip were olives, maple and boxtree, shipbuilding and furniture timber, nuts and cherries (Strabo 12 . 3 . 12 ). Her colonies to the east-Kotyora (no. 722 ), Kerasous (no. 719 ) and Trapezous (no. 734 )-were, by the time of Xenophon, dependent poleis , colonies of Sinope (Kotyora (no. 722 ) paid a dasmos to Sinope: Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 10 ). They gave her access to the silver, iron and slaves-resources of the coastal Kolchoi, Chalybes and Tibarenoi. As 'Paphlago'was regarded as a typical slave-name in Classical Greece it is likely that Sinope traded profitably in Paphlagonians too. From inland came the Kappadokian ruddle called Sinopis (red earth for rendering ships watertight (Theophr. De lapidibus 52 )) and there was the longrange overland journey across Asia, from Amisos (no. 712 ) to the eastern Mediterranean at Tarsos, in which Sinope seems to have had a strong interest. But above all, the métier of Sinope seems to have been the sea: her catch of tunny fish was famous (Strabo 12 . 3 . 11 ), and her site on the peninsula, opposite the southern tip of the Crimea (Strabo 12 . 3 . 10 ), not far from a recognised crossing to Sindike on the Asiatic side of the Kimmerian Bosporos opposite Bata (Strabo 11 . 2 . 13 ) on the Caucasus coast,made her the ideal harbour on which to converge from all shores of the Black Sea. The matchless virtues of its site on the long Turkish coast have already been remarked on. Clearly the sea was, in a real sense, her territory even more than the Pedalion (the peninsula),the narrow stretch of Sinopitis , and the vulnerable lands around her colonies. Sinope receives two detailed descriptions in ancient literature (Polyb. 4 . 56 ; Strabo 12 . 3 . 11 ). It lay on an isthmus 400 m wide at its narrowest and on part of the peninsula (modern Ince Burun), pushing eastward from the mainland of Turkey. It was a little more than halfway ( 560 km) along the coast from the entrance to the Black Sea. It was three days' sail on to the river Phasis and Kolchis, and a day-and-night's sail (from Cape Karambis) to the southern tip of the Crimea. Sinope possessed harbours to the north and south of the isthmus; that to the south is the finest natural harbour on the whole 900 km stretch of the modern Turkish Black Sea coast (Maximova ( 1956 ) 37 , map of the eighteenth century; Akurgal ( 1976 )). Local Pontic tradition speaks of three harbours, July, August and Sinop, ensuring safety for ships! Archaeological material from Sinope consists of chance finds from the cemetery to the west of the town, made during the building of a match factory in the 1920 s and sporadically from the 1930 s to 1980 s. There were excavations in 1951 -53 , during which a Heltic temple and altar (to Sarapis?) were brought to light and left conserved in the public park (Akurgal and Budde ( 1956 ) 27 -41 ). The earliest pottery found dates from C7l and C6e (Boysal ( 1959 ) 8 -9 ). Sculptured grave stelai , in what seems local work of C5s, were found in 1925 (Akurgal ( 1948 ) 581 -88 ), and there are more standard types of stelai of C5l-C4 . A number of simple column stelai of C4 -C3 have been published recently, bearing such Milesian theophoric names as Delphinios and Molpagoras (Jones ( 1988 ); French ( 1990 )). Two bronze hydriai from the cemetery give some idea of wealth in C4 (Akurgal and Budde ( 1956 ) 12 -16 ; Uygur ( 1989 ) 209 -11 ). Finds of deposits of Sinopean olive oil and wine trade amphoras (French ( 1985 )), and most recently of kilns for their production (at Zeytinlik on Sinope's southern bay and at Demirai 15 km away) are recent indicators of Sinope's most prominent branch of production (Kassab-Tezgör ( 1996 )). From c. 360 -350 Sinope produced bulk-carrying amphoras for her olive oil and perhaps some wine, which were exported all over the Black Sea region until c. 200 / 183 (Grakov ( 1929 ); Tsekhmistrenko ( 1958 ) 56 ff; Brashinskij ( 1962 ); Monakhov ( 1993 ); Conovici ( 1998 ) 21 -51 ). It appears from Aen. Tact. 40 . 4 that Sinope was fortified by c. 370 (cf. Whitehead ( 1990 ) ad loc .). The earliest coinage of Sinope dates from before the Athenian colony, perhaps c. 480 -460 when silver coins were struck on the Aiginetan standard. Denomination: drachm. Types: obv . head of eagle, below a small dolphin, on many examples the head is very crude, on some very fine; rev . incuse, opposed lozenges with dots or finely stippled (Hind ( 1976 ); Kraay and Moorey ( 1981 ); Price ( 1993 ) pl. LI; SNG Cop. Paphlagonia 272 -73 ). A change of type comes in C4 , perhaps after the departure of the Athenian colonists: obv . head of nymph Sinope, sometimes in a ring of dots; rev . eagle flying, apparently clutching a small dolphin; legend: ΣΙΝΩ . Smaller denominations (hemi- or quarter-drachms and obols) have the eagle facing with wings outstretched, perhaps hinting at a connection with Amisos (no. 712 ) (Price ( 1993 ) pls. LI-LIV; SNG Cop. Paphlagonia 274 -89 ). The theme of the eagle on dolphin,repeated with variants at Istros (no. 685 ) and Olbia (no. 690 ), suggests that this may be an 'alliance type'such as noted in Ionia and Hellespont,and at Byzantion (no. 674 )/Kalchedon (no. 743 ) at roughly the same time,taking the cult of Zeus Ourios as its patron (Hind ( 1999 b )). An alternative view is that all three cities adopted symbols of Zeus (eagle) and Apollo (dolphin) to advertise their civic cults (Karyshkovskij ( 1982 )). The legend on the reverses of the silver coins of c. 410 -300 is ΣΙΝΩ , which could be an abbreviated form of the toponym or the collective city-ethnic. That it is the city-ethnic is indicated by the Aramaic inscription on the C4s coins ('people of Sinope'). That it is the toponym is indicated by the later Heltic coins inscribed ΣΙΝΩΠΗΣ ( SNG Cop. Paphlagonia 302 -13 )."

According to most authors (e.g. Hdt. 4 . 86 . 3 ; Pompon. 1 . 105 ), it was a former city of the Amazons or of the Leukosyroi, situated by the river Thermodon. By Strabo's time it was a 'plain and former abode of the Amazons'( 12 . 3 . 14 -15 ; cf. Steph. Byz. 677 . 4 )."

The toponym is Τίειον , τό (Ps.Skylax 90 ; Strabo 12 . 3 . 10 (conj.), 4 . 7 ). Alternative forms are Τῖος , ηasper (Memnon ( FGrHist 434 ) 15 . 19 ; Pompon. 1 . 104 ) or Τίον , τό (Ael. NA 15 . 5 ; Ptol. Geog . 5 . 1 . 3 ). The city-ethnic Τιανός is found on C4l/C3e coins ( infra ). Tieion is called a polis Hel in the urban sense at Ps.Skylax 90 ; it was one of four settlements ( katoikiai ) brought together in the new foundation Amastris,by the former wife of Dionysios, tyrant of Herakleia and latterly wife of Lysimachos c. 300 -290 (Strabo 12 . 3 . 10 ). The synoecised communities are called poleis and attributed to Miletos (no. 854 ) by Ps.-Skymnos 1005 , Diller, probably referring to the time of foundation, which is, however, unknown; Pompon. 1 . 104 also says that Tieion was Milesian. The collective cityethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ); the external individual use is found in three sepulchral inscriptions from Athens ( IG ii² 10488 ( Τιανή , C4m), 10449 (C4m) and 10450 (C5l)). Soon after the synoecism, Tieion became independent again from the koinonia (Strabo 12 . 3 . 10 ). Bronze coinage of C4l/C3e, inscribed ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΙΑ , reflects these events ( infra ). Tieion (Hisarenu) lay at the mouth of the river Billaios (Filyos-Çayı) in the territory of the Kaukones (Strabo 12 . 3 . 5 ). To the west lay Bithynia and, to the east, Paphlagonia-with the river Parthenios some 20 km distant. Nothing of Classical date is known from the site, except for its general layout (Bean ( 1976 )). Foundation legends search for heroic connection; Dionysos is κτίστης on coins of Roman date (Head, HN ² 518 ); Tios, a Milesian priest, was the founder,according to Philon apud Steph.Byz. 624 . 20 -21 ; one Pataros took the land of Paphlagonia and named it Dia εκ τουtilde τι µ αtildeν τοgraveν ∆ία (Demosthenes' Bithyniaka apud Steph.

The toponym is Τραπεζουtildeς , -ντος , ηasper (Xen. An . 4 . 8 . 22 ; Ael. NA 5 . 42 ; Ps.Skylax 85 ). The city-ethnic is Τραπεζουacuteντιος (Xen. An . 5 . 4 . 1 ). Trapezous is called polis both in the urban sense (Xen. An . 4 . 8 . 22 ; Ps.-Skylax 85 : πόλις ' Ελληνίς ) and in the political sense (Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 15 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic may be attested internally in abbreviated form on C5l/C4e coins ( infra ) and is attested externally in several passages of the Anabasis , e.g. 4 . 8 . 23 , 5 . 1 . 11 . The external individual use is found at Xen. An . 5 . 4 . 2 : Τι µ ησίθεος οasper Τραπεζουacuteντιος who was proxenos of the Mossynoikoi. According to Xenophon, Trapezous was a colony ( apoikia ) of Sinope (no. 729 ) in the land of the Kolchoi, who lived in komai in its territory (Xen. An . 4 . 8 . 22 ; Hansen ( 1995 ) 79 -80 ). The Armenian version of Eusebios provides a date for Trapezous that is precise but wrong ( ann. Abr . 1260 = 757 / 6 ), ¹ which is almost certainly a confusion with the entry for Kyzikos (no. 747 ) in the Latin of Jerome (Hind ( 1988 ) 213 -14 ; Huxley ( 1990 ) 199 ; Ivantchik ( 1998 ) 314 -18 ). This unreliable tabular date apart, there is no trace of a colonisation date for Trapezous. The army of Xenophon borrowed from the Trapezountians two ships, one pentekonter and one triakonter , with which to commandeer transport ships (which were sailing past to Phasis and back) in order to convey the troops westward (Xen. An . 5 . 1 . 11 , 3 . 11 ). Some Arkadians from Trapezous (no. 303 ) in Arkadia are said to have joined this colony after refusing to join the synoecism of Megalopolis (Paus. 8 . 27 . 6 ); if historical, the many Arkadians in the army of the Ten Thousand may have provided information to their fellows about the city with the same name in the Pontos that had been so welcoming to Greeks (Xen. An . 4 . 8 . 23 , 5 . 1 . 14 , 2 . 2 ). At the end of C5 Trapezous was a dependent polis , paying tribute ( dasmos ) to Sinope (no. 729 ) (Xen. An . 5 . 5 . 10 ). Trapezous (modern Trabzon) lies 460 km east of Sinope. It profited from the coastal route east to Phasis, and from a route inland to the south. It had supplies of timber and silver in the hills. Its greatest period of glory was in Roman and Byzantine times, when it outlasted Byzantion itself by eight years, succumbing to the Ottomans in 1461 . Trapezous struck silver coins on the Persic standard in C5l-C4e. Denominations: drachm and quarter. Types: obv . head of young man with short,stubbly beard; rev . table with pile of coins; legend: ΤΡΑ . The reverse type, a moneychanger's table = τράπεζα , seems to be a clear case of a punning type (Head, HN ² 499 ; Price ( 1993 ) pl. XLVIII). That the legend is an abbreviated form of the city-ethnic is indicated by the attestation of the full form of the ethnic on coins of the Imperial period. ¹ Editions of the Armenian Eusebios: Eusebii Chronicorum Libri Duo , ed.

Type: C: β . The toponym is Αρταίου τεῖχος , τό ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 114 , 77 . iv . 4 -5 ). According to Steph. Byz. 127 . 12 , quoting Krateros, the city-ethnic is Αρταιοτειχίτης (cf. IG i³ 100 . fr. 7 = Krateros ( FGrHist 342 ) fr. 6 ). In spite of the text printed in IG i³ we have no guarantee that the city-ethnic stems from Krateros, and thus from the tribute lists. [ Αρταιοτε ] ιχῖ ( ται ) at IG i³ 283 ii . 10 lends some support to the ethnic reported by Stephanos, but is heavily restored. Stephanos' note at 127 . 10 -12 suggests the ephemeral existence of a polis in the region of the river Rhyndakos: εστι καιgrave Αρταίου τεῖχος πολίχνιον επιgrave τΩsubiotaῶ ' ΡυνδάκΩsubiotaω ποτα µ αsubiotaῶ , ωasperς Κράτερος ενάτΩsubiotaω περιgrave ψηφισ µ άτων . τοgrave εθνικοgraveν Αρταιοτειχίτης . The name shows that Artaiou Teichos was a fortified settlement, and its attestation in an Athenian assessment decree and, possibly, tribute lists shows that it was a political community. Stephanos' classification of the community as a polichnion carries no weight; but Artaiou Teichos may have been a small polis as indicated by the assessment of 1 , 000 dr. in 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 4 -5 ). The name is obviously of Persian origin,since the Persians called themselves Αρταῖοι (Hdt. 7 . 61 . 2 ; cf. 7 . 22 . 2 and 66 . 2 ). Hirschfeld ( 1895 a ) cautiously identified Artaiou Teichos with Ariace, inserted at Plin. HN 5 . 142 between Plakia (no. 757 ) and Skylake (no. 761 ), but Ariace is more likely to be identified with Artake (no. 736 ).A preferable location on the lower Rhyndakos is suggested by ATL i. 471 ."
736,Artake (Artakenos),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.25,27.5,501,2281,"736 . Artake (Artakenos) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 25 , long. 27 . 50 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Αρτάκη , ηasper (Hdt. 4 . 14 . 2 , 6 . 33 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 94 ). The city-ethnic is Αρτακηνός ( IG i³ 261 . i . 14 ) or Αρτακευacuteς (Soph.fr. 917 , Radt; cf. Steph. Byz. 127 . 19 ). Artake is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 4 . 14 . 2 , and in Ps.-Skylax 94 Artake is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε . For the collective and external use of the city-ethnic, see IG i³ 261 . i . 14 . Artake was located on the island of Kyzikos facing Priapos (no. 758 ) (Strabo 13 . 1 . 4 ), near Kyzikos (no. 747 ) (Hdt. 4 . 14 . 2 ) and the isthmos (Ps.-Skylax 94 ), and has been identified with modern (Turkish) Erdek c. 7 -8 km west of Kyzikos. The modern toponym derives from Greek Artaki (Hirschfeld ( 1895 b ) 1304 ). For descriptions of the site, see Texier ( 1862 ) 164 -65 ; Philippson ( 1910 ) 52 -53 ; and L. Robert ( 1955 ) 131 -33 , using Radet's survey from 1887 . Of the few archaeological remains, the most important is an Archaic kouros (Laubscher ( 1963 -64 ) 73 ff). Artake was colonised by Miletos (no. 854 ) (Anaximenes of Lampsakos ( FGrHist 72 ) fr. 26 ; cf. Steph. Byz. 127 . 13 ; schol. Ap. Rhod. 1 . 955 ). Artake took part in the Ionian Revolt and was burnt by the Persians in 493 (Hdt. 6 . 33 . 2 ). Later it joined the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 8 ) to 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 11 ) a total of sixteen times, twice completely restored, paying a tribute of 2 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 261 . i . 14 ), raised to 4 , 000 dr. in 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 11 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 82 ). Coinage is not attested, which may suggest a rather early incorporation of Artake into Kyzikos, perhaps simultaneously with Prokonnesos (no. 759 ), i.e. in C4 (Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 38 with n. 244 ). Strabo 13 . 1 . 4 speaks only of a mountain, an island and, in another context, a chorion , while Plin. HN 5 . 141 mentions the harbour and writes that the city had disappeared: Artace portus ubi oppidum fuit ; but cf. HN 5 . 151 : Artacaeon cum oppido . The toponym does not occur in Pomponius Mela."
737,Astakos (Astakenos),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.45,29.55,916,4304,"737 . Astakos (Astakenos) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 45 , long. 29 . 55 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: α . The toponym is Αστακός , ηasper (Strabo 12 . 4 . 2 ) or, once, /acuteΟστακος , ηasper (Charon of Lampsakos ( FGrHist 262 ) fr. 6 ). The city-ethnic is Αστακηνός , attested in the Athenian tribute lists in its collective and external use ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 27 ). Astakos is not attested as a polis in sources of the Archaic and Classical periods, but deserves inclusion as a polis type B since ( 1 ) it had a mint ( infra ); ( 2 ) it was a member of the Delian League ( infra ); and ( 3 ) it is retrospectively classified as a polis in later sources (Diod. 19 . 60 . 3 (r 315 ); Polyaen. 2 . 30 . 3 (r 363 -352 )). The ancient site must have been somewhere on the south coast of the Gulf of I . zmit called κόλπος Αστακηνός (Strabo 10 . 2 . 21 , 12 . 4 . 2 ; Steph. Byz. 238 . 17 ) or κόλπος ' Ολβιανός (Ps.-Skylax 92 ; Pompon. 1 . 100 ). Astakos may have been situated near modern Yuvacık (Ruge ( 1896 ) 1774 ), but a location closer to the sea, at 'Ba  s Iskele, dans la zone du port militaire de Gölcük' , seems more likely, since this site produced some Archaic (?) and Classical pottery ( BE ( 1974 ) 574 summarising S  ahin ( 1974 ) 66 -83 ). The territory of Astakos is described by Polyaen. 2 . 30 . 3 as a marshy χώρα inhabited by ΘρΩsubiotaαtildeκες (perhaps Bithynian 'helots': Burstein ( 1976 ) 130 n. 64 ). A πολίχνιον Μεγαρικόν (Arr. ( FGrHist 156 ) fr. 18 = Plin. HN 5 . 148 : Megarice oppidum ) tentatively located by R. Kiepert at Cape Çatal Burun (Ruge ( 1931 )) clearly indicates colonisation by Megara (no. 225 ). According to Charon of Lampsakos ( FGrHist 262 fr. 6 ), Astakos was founded by the Kalchedonians (no. 743 ). But other sources mention Megara (no. 225 ) as the metropolis (Strabo 12 . 4 . 2 ; Pompon. 1 . 100 ; Memnon ( FGrHist 434 ) fr. 12 ( 20 ), whose source was Nymphis of Herakleia (C4 -C3 ); cf. Toepffer ( 1896 ) 126 ). Both Memnon and Strabo mention the later Athenian colony ( infra ) and local Bithynian settlers as well. Combining the sources, we may infer that Astakos was founded by Kalchedonians (Merkelbach ( 1980 ) 91 ) but possibly reinforced by Megarians, since a πολίχνιον Μεγαρικόν is attested in the territory of Astakos (Hanell ( 1934 ) 120 ; Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 51 , 53 ). The foundation year of 712 / 11 , given by Memnon (( FGrHist 434 ) fr. 12 ( 20 )) and by Euseb. Chron . 91 , Helm, is too early, since Kalchedon itself was founded about 685 . Scholars generally assume a date in C7 (Hanell ( 1934 ) 120 ; Merkelbach ( 1980 ) 91 ). According to Memnon, the oecist was Astakos, a descendant of the Spartans from Thebes, while for Arrian ( FGrHist 156 fr. 26 ) Astakos was son of Poseidon and the nymph Olbia (cf. Asheri ( 1978 )). Astakos was a member of the Delian League. It is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 27 ) to 444 / 3 ( IG i³ 268 . i . 33 , almost completely restored) a total of five times, paying a tribute of 3 , 000 dr. in 454 / 3 -453 / 2 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 27 , 260 . viii . 18 ), reduced to 1 , 000 dr. in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 16 ). It is absent from the full panel of 442 / 1 ( IG i³ 270 . i . 35 -ii . 30 ). Accepting Niese's attractive emendation of Diod. 12 . 3 . 5 ( Αστακόν for MSS Λέτανον ), we can infer that the Athenians in 435 / 4 placed a colony at Astakos (Meiggs ( 1972 ) 198 ; Schuller ( 1974 ) 30 -31 , 155 ; cf. Strabo 12 . 4 . 2 and Memnon ( FGrHist 434 ) fr. 12 ( 20 )). Astakos was unsuccessfully besieged c. 363 -352 by Klearchos, the tyrant of Herakleia Pontike (no. 715 ) (Polyaen. 2 . 30 . 3 ; cf. Burstein ( 1976 ) 55 -56 ), and in 315 by Zipoites (Diod. 19 . 60 . 3 ). Both references to sieges show that the city was fortified. In 281 , however,Astakos was destroyed and replaced by Nikomedia, settled inter alios with the inhabitants of Astakos (Strabo 12 . 4 . 2 ; Paus. 5 . 12 . 7 ). Astakos struck silver coins in C5 on the Persian standard. Denominations: drachms and smaller fractions. Types: obv . lobster or crayfish, i.e. an αστακός , a pun on the toponym; rev . female head, first of Archaic style ( c. 500 -435 ), later of Classical style ( c. 435 -400 ), incuse square, swastika; legend: ΑΣ (Head, HN ² 510 ).

738,Bysbikos (Bysbikenos),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.35,28.3,478,2319,"738 . Bysbikos (Bysbikenos) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 35 , long. 28 . 30 . Size of territory: 1 ( 10 km ² ). Type: [A]:? The toponym is Βυacuteσβικος ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 34 ) or Βέσβικος (Ps.-Skylax 94 ; Agathokles ( FGrHist 472 ) fr. 2 (in both cases explicitly denoting the island)). The city-ethnic is Βυσβικενός ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 13 : [ Βυσβ ] ικενοί ). Bysbikos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded from 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 34 ) to 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 13 ) a total of four times, once completely restored. The tribute list for the year 434 / 3 records Bysbikos under the heading πόλες h αgraveς h οι ιδι ˜ οται ενέγραφσαν φόρον φέρειν (where polis is used in the political sense) with a tribute of 3 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 34 ); thereafter the city is listed as having been assessed by the boule and a dikasterion in 430 / 29 (restored in IG i³ 281 . iii . 65 ) and in 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . ii . 48 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 80 ). The Bysbikenians inhabited the island of Βέσβικος situated in the Sea of Marmara outside the mouth of the river Rhyndakos (Ps.-Skylax 94 ; Plin. HN 5 . 151 : circumference 18 Roman miles) and probably to be identified with modern I . mralı Adası (Hasluck ( 1910 ) 53 -55 ), which, however, has a circumference of no more than 13 Roman miles.For a different identification, see the garbled passage at Strabo 12 . 8 . 11 and Amm.Marc. 22 . 8 . 6 . If we can trust some of Strabo's garbled account, Besbikos was a dependency of Kyzikos (no. 747 ), a piece of information which may be linked to the tradition that Kore (whose worship is attested in Kyzikos by coins from C4 onwards) played an important role in the battle of the Giants (cf. L. Robert ( 1987 ) 166 ). Quoting Agathokles of Kyzikos (( FGrHist 472 ) fr. 2 (C3 )), Steph. Byz. 165 . 10 -166 . 5 says that the island originally was a stone thrown by the Giant Besbikos and transformed into an island by his opponent,the goddess Kore.Agathokles also reports what must be a rival foundation myth according to which Besbikos was a Pelasgian (Tümpel ( 1897 )). So far no remains of an ancient town have been found on the island, but its classification by Agathokles as a κτίσ µ α indicates some kind of nucleated settlement."

The only other source is Steph. Byz., who describes Darieion as a πόλις τηtildeς Φρυγίας without quoting any source (Bürchner ( 1901 ); ATL i. 479 )."
740,Daskyleion (Daskyleianos),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.25,28.4,531,2609,"740 . Daskyleion (Daskyleianos) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 25 , long. 28 . 40 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: α . The toponym is ∆ασκυacuteλειον ( IG i³ 278 . iv . 7 -8 ). The city-ethnic is ∆ασκυλειανός ( IG i³ 278 . iv . 9 ). The only author to call Daskyleion a polis is Strabo at 12 . 8 . 10 , but the reference is to his own time. Among the five homonymous sites recorded by Steph.Byz. s.v. Daskyleion ( 220 . 9 -17 ), two have sometimes been confused by ancient sources (e.g. Strabo 12 . 8 . 10 ) and modern authors (e.g. Ruge ( 1901 )): . . . τετάρτηsubiotaη [ sc . πόλει ] περιgrave Βιθυνίαν [i.e. the polis Daskyleion]. πέ µ πτηsubiotaη τηtildeς Αιολίδος καιgrave Φρυγίας [i.e. the seat of the Persian satrapy]. Recent excavations (reported in Mitchell ( 1990 ) 89 and ( 1999 ) 130 ) have finally confirmed the identification of the satrap's residence with the mound called Hısartepe near Ergili, on the south-western shore of the Manyas Gölü, consequently to be identified with the ∆ασκυλῖτις λί µ νη recorded by Strabo 12 . 8 . 10 , 11 (Akurgal ( 1976 a ) 259 and map 5 ). Preserving its ancient name in Byzantine sources, ancient Greek Daskyleion was easily identified with modern (Turkish) Eskel Limanı, on a peninsula jutting into the Sea of Marmara. This was presumably the harbour, while the main site has been found in the area of the village Esence (former Eskel or Eskel köy) lying c. 2 km inland (Corsten ( 1988 ) 54 -57 with figs. 1 -3 ). The site was not excavated, but the field surveys yielded ceramics of C4 as the earliest material (Bittel ( 1953 ) 6 ), and some late inscriptions have been found by chance (Corsten ( 1988 ) 72 -77 nos. 1 -6 , ( 1990 ) 43 -46 nos. 7 -10 ). In spite of the lack of positive evidence, one may suppose that Daskyleion was colonised by Miletos (no. 854 ). According to Nikolaos of Damaskos ( FGrHist 90 ) fr. 63 , a certain Miletos, probably a Milesian, was married into the Lydian royal family but went into exile and came first to Daskyleion, later to Prokonnesos. If we can trust these late sources, Daskyleion was a Milesian foundation (Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 47 ; Corsten ( 1988 ) 63 -64 ). Daskyleion was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 16 -17 ) to, possibly, 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . iii . 37 ) a total of seven times, twice completely restored, paying in all years a phoros of 500 dr. ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 23 ). It is absent from the full panel of 442 / 1 ( IG i³ 270 . i . 35 -ii . 30 ) but was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 75 )."
741,Didymon Teichos (Didymoteichites),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.15,27.15,269,1175,"741 . *Didymon Teichos (Didymoteichites) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 15 , long. 27 . 15 . Size of territory: ? Type: B:? The toponym ∆ίδυ µ ον τεῖχος is reconstructed from the ethnic ∆ιδυ µ οτειχῖται , recorded in the Athenian tribute lists next to the ∆αυνοτειχῖται in the years from 443 / 2 ( IG i³ 269 . ii . 3 -4 ) to 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 19 -20 ). Taking the juxtaposition of the two teiche to indicate geographical proximity, ATL i. 481 -82 located Didymon Teichos next to Daunoteichos on the northern coast of the Propontis. But following L. Robert ( 1937 ) 195 , Barr . identifies ∆ίδυ µ ον τεῖχος with the ∆ίδυ µ α τείχη mentioned at Polyb. 5 . 77 . 8 and located at Dimetoka on the river Granikos; see also Isaac ( 1986 ) 204 and Sayar ( 1998 ). Didymon Teichos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 17 -18 ) to 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 19 ) a total of sixteen times; down to 430 / 29 it paid a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 278 . iii . 22 ), but in 420 / 19 a higher sum, probably 2 tal. ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 19 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 95 )."
742,Harpagion (Harpagianos),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.2,27.25,270,1289,"742 . Harpagion (Harpagianos) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 20 , long. 27 . 25 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: α ? The toponym is Αasperρπάγιον (Thuc. 8 . 107 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is Αasperρπάγιος ( IG i³ 267 . i . 23 ) or Αasperρπαγιανός ( IG i³ 270 . ii . 4 ). According to Strabo 13 . 1 . 11 , Harpagion ( ταgrave Αasperρπάγια ) was situated between Kyzikos (no. 747 ) and Priapos (no. 758 ). It has not been convincingly located (Olshausen ( 1974 ) 483 ), but a position near the mouth of the river Granikos was suggested in ATL i. 470 . Harpagion was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 448 / 7 ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 37 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . iii . 36 ) a total of fourteen times, twice completely restored, paying in all years a phoros of 300 dr. ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 37 ). It was perhaps assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 68 , completely restored). Harpagion is not mentioned in later historical sources, and one may assume that it was incorporated, possibly in C4l, into either Priapos (no. 758 ) or Kyzikos (no. 747 ). In C4 , before the incorporation, Harpagion struck bronze coins. Types: obv . nymph, head turreted; rev . fish, below corn-ear; legend: ΑΡΠΑΓΙ (Fritze ( 1913 ) 14 no. 597 )."
743,Kalchedon (Kalchedonios),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,41.0,29.0,2636,13070,"743 . Kalchedon (Kalchedonios) Map 52 . Lat. 41 . 00 , long. 29 . 00 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Καλχηδών , ηasper (Thuc. 4 . 75 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 4 ; I.Histriae I 5 (C3 )) or in Doric Καλχαδών , ηasper ( SEG 28 1661 (C3 ); I.Kalchedon 33 . 9 (undated)) or Χαλκηδών , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 92 ; Dem. 15 . 26 ; Diod. 13 . 66 . 1 ; I.Kalchedon 22 . 8 (fifth century ad )). The city-ethnic is Καλχηδόνιος ( IG i³ 285 . ii . 83 ; Hdt. 4 . 144 . 1 ) or in Doric Καλχαδόνιος (coins, infra ; IG ii² 8949 (C4s); SEG 31 1062 (undated)) or Χαλκηδόνιος (Aen. Tact. 12 . 3 ; Arist. Pol . 1266 a 39 ) or Χαλχηδόνιος ( IG i³ 263 . v . 17 ; I.Kalchedon 101 . 1 (Imperial)).Kalchedon is attested as a polis both in the urban sense (Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 5 -6 ; Ps.-Skylax 92 ; Arist. Oec . 1347 b 20 ) and in the political sense (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 31 ; Aen. Tact. 12 . 2 , 4 ; Arist. Oec . 1347 b 20 , 23 , 29 ; Orat . Adespota fr. 8 , Sauppe). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on C4 coins ( infra ) and externally in e.g. IG i³ 263 . v . 17 and 285 . ii . 83 . The individual and external use is attested by Plato's mention of Θρασυacute µ αχος οasper Καλχηδόνιος ( Resp . 328 B) and Aristotle's of Φαλέας οasper Χαλκηδόνιος ( Pol . 1266 a 39 ). The territory of Kalchedon ( χώρα : Hdt. 6 . 33 . 2 ) is called Καλχηδονία (Hdt. 4 . 85 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 22 , An . 6 . 6 . 38 ). Patris is found in Thrasymachos T 8 , DK. According to Euseb. Chron . 93 b, Helm, Kalchedon was founded in 685 . Hdt. 4 . 144 . 1 reports that the city was founded seventeen years before Byzantion (no. 674 ) and that the colonisers were said to have been 'blind' because they had not realised the advantages of the European shore of the Bosporos (the later Byzantion); cf. Caecorum oppidum (Plin. HN 5 . 149 ). All sources agree that Megara (no. 225 ) was the metropolis (Thuc. 4 . 75 . 2 ). Pompon. 1 . 101 calls the oecist ( auctor ) Archias Megarensium princeps . The city's history is blank down to C6l. In 514 / 13 Dareios crossed the Bosporos at Kalchedon (Hdt. 4 . 85 . 1 , 87 . 2 ), but when the king returned to Asia after the failed Scythian expedition, he destroyed the city because the Kalchedonians allegedly had intended to demolish the bridge (Ktesias ( FGrHist 688 ) fr. 13 . 21 ; Polyaen. 7 . 11 . 5 , see Merle ( 1916 ) 11 ; Merkelbach ( 1980 ) 92 , 120 ; Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 88 -89 ). The main source for these events (Hdt. 4 . 143 . 1 ) indicates the Hellespont for Dareios' retreat, but Loukopoulou argues that Dareios first punished Kalchedon and then for security reasons chose the Hellespontine route. Some years later Kalchedon was taken by the satrap Otanes (Hdt. 5 . 26 ). The regime established by the Persians may have induced the Kalchedonians to join the Ionian Revolt. This is only suggested by Hdt. 5 . 103 . 2 ( Βυζάντιόν τε καιgrave ταgraveς άλλας πόλις πάσας ταgraveς ταυacuteτηsubiotaη ), but Kalchedonian participation in the Revolt is securely established by the fact that in 493 some of the Kalchedonians fled to Mesambria on the Pontos Euxeinos when the city was attacked by a Persian-Phoenician fleet (see Mesambria (no. 687 ) and infra ). Pausanias' conquest of Byzantion in 478 (Thuc. 1 . 94 . 2 ) probably marks the end of Persian supremacy over Kalchedon (Merkelbach ( 1980 ) 92 ). Atan unknown date Kalchedon joined the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded from 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . vii . 12 ) to 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 16 ) a total of nineteen times,once completely restored,paying a phoros of 7½ tal. ( 452 / 1 ), 3 tal. ( 450 / 49 ), 9 tal. ( 448 -438 ) and 6 tal. ( 434 -429 ). It was perhaps assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 61 , completely restored). Kalchedon fought with Athens in 424 (Thuc. 4 . 75 . 2 ), but in 412 or 411 it was occupied by a Spartan garrison under a harmostes (Plut. Alc . 29 . 6 ; Diod. 13 . 66 . 2 ). Except for a short break in 409 (Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 1 -12 ) Kalchedon remained under Spartan occupation (Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 1 (r 405 )) until 389 , when Thrasyboulos restored Athenian control (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 27 -28 ). In 387 it was conquered once again by Sparta (no. 345 ) (Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 25 ; Polyaen. 2 . 24 ). By the King's Peace of 387 / 6 Kalchedon fell to Persia, and in 357 it was conquered by Byzantion (Dem. 15 . 26 ; Theopomp. fr. 62 ). In 362 Kalchedon, Byzantion and Kyzikos (no. 747 ) had been allied with Thebes (no. 221 ) and captured Athenian merchantmen (Dem. 50 . 6 , 17 ; cf. Arist. Oec . 1347 b 20 -30 ). However, a crown dedicated to Athena in Athens by the Kalchedonian state indicates friendly relations with Athens in 354 / 3 ( IG ii² 1437 . 16 ). At an unknown date in C4f, perhaps the 360 s, Kalchedon was besieged and assisted by a contingent of Kyzikene soldiers (Aen. Tact. 12 . 3 ; cf. P Oxy . 303 ) and so was probably allied to Kyzikos. In C4l Kalchedon joined the κοινοgraveν τῶν ' Ιλιέων (L. Robert ( 1966 ) 31 , 39 ). The only thing we know about the type of constitution is that, as a result of the conquest of Kalchedon by Byzantion in 357 , a moderate form of constitution was changed into a radical democracy (Theopomp. fr. 62 ). Civic subdivisions are attested in Heltic sources only (especially I.Kalchedon 6 and 7 ), but since they are of Megarian origin, they may go back to the foundation of Kalchedon in C7e. The citizen body was subdivided into, probably, hundreds ( εκατοστυacuteες ; cf. Jones, POAG 283 -84 ; Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 141 -42 ). The names of several of the hundreds are attested as sub-ethnics in Heltic dedications, e.g. Βυacuteριχος Αισχηιdieresisacuteδα ' Ιππωνήας ( I.Kalchedon 7 . 11 ). The presence of metics is attested in Arist. Oec . 1347 b 20 -30 . Some of the known officials are common for all (or some) Megarian foundations;consequently the Heltic sources can be interpreted retrospectively.This applies to the eponymous magistrate, called basileus ( I.Kalchedon 7 . 1 , 8 . 1 ). A hieromnamon ( I.Kalchedon 4 . 5 , 7 , 42 ) is not attested at Megara (no. 225 ); at Byzantion he was the eponymous magistrate; while at Kalchedon he clearly accompanied the basileus (Hanell ( 1934 ) 151 ) and indicates a Kalchedonian origin for the Byzantine hieromnamon (Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 145 -46 ).Also of Megarian origin were the aisymnatai . Like the Athenian prytaneis , they were perhaps members of the Council ( I.Kalchedon 10 . 10 ) selected by lot every month ( I.Kalchedon 6 . 1 -2 ). One of them seems to have been the αasperγε µ ωgraveν βουλαtildeς ( I.Kalchedon 7 . 8 ; see Hanell ( 1934 ) 150 ; Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 145 ). The council itself ( βουλά ), as well as the assembly ( δαtilde µ ος ), is attested in I.Kalchedon 1 (C2e) and 10 (C3 -C2 ). A board of strategoi ( I.Kalchedon 1 . 73 -74 ) may also go back to the Archaic and Classical periods. Since Kalchedon was a Megarian colony, a number of attested civic subdivisions may be evidence of hekatostyes ( I.Kalchedon 6 and 7 ; see supra ). Citizens of Kalchedon were granted proxenia by Karthaia (no. 492 ) ( IG xii . 5 542 . 10 (C4m)) and Pantikapaion (no. 705 ) ( IOSPE ii 2 = CIRB 2 (C4s)). Kalchedon is located on the promontory Kadıköy, on the Asiatic shore of modern Istanbul.The ancient topography is imperfectly known (see a plan at Merkelbach ( 1980 ) 143 ). However,mediaeval testimonies attest remains of a harbour between Kadıköy and Haidar Pa  sa (Ruge ( 1919 a ) 1558 ); a cemetery has been identified (Asgari and Firatlı ( 1978 )); and some inscriptions and architectural or sculptural remains have been found by chance or through minor excavations (see also Müller-Wiener ( 1977 )). City walls are explicitly mentioned by Polyaen. 7 . 11 . 5 (r 513 ) and can be inferred from the numerous sieges of Kalchedon (Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 4 ( 409 ); Polyaen. 2 . 24 (r 387 ); Aen. Tact. 12 . 3 ( 360 s?); Diod. 19 . 60 . 3 (r 315 )). Evidence for public architecture is late, and the lack of excavations does not allow a closer examination of the literary and epigraphic testimonies. The town had two harbours, one on each side of the peninsula (Dionysios of Byzantion 111 p. 33 , Güngerich), but the most important seems to have been the unlocated Φρίξου λι µ ήν (Diod. 18 . 72 . 4 (r 318 ); Dionysios of Byzantion 99 p. 31 , Güngerich; Steph. Byz. 672 . 15 , quoting Nymphis of Herakleia (C4 -C3 )). Oberhummer ( 1897 ) 753 suggests that the Phrixos harbour was located at Kanliçe at the far end of the Bosporos. The most important and best-attested settlement in the territory of Kalchedon is Chrysopolis, located at Üsküdar (former Skutari) (Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 22 , 1 . 3 . 12 , An . 6 . 6 . 38 ; Diod. 14 . 31 . 4 (r 400 ); P Oxy . 303 ). In 410 / 9 it was fortified by Alkibiades (Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 22 ; cf. Diod. 13 . 64 . 2 -3 ). Another settlement ( εποικία ) called Αacute µ υκος is mentioned in schol. Ap. Rhod. 2 . 159 b, quoting Androitas of Tenedos (C4 -C3 ). Of sanctuaries in Chalkedon's territory, the most famous was the hieron (Dem. 20 . 36 , 35 . 10 , 50 . 17 and 58 ; Ps.-Skylax 67 and 92 ) at the Euxine end of the Bosporos (located at Anadolu Kava˘ gi-Yenimahalle). According to the tradition, Jason sacrificed here when he returned from Kolchis (Pind. Pyth . 4 . 203 -7 ; Polyb. 4 . 39 . 6 ) and various testimonies record a sanctuary of Ζευgraveς Ουacuteριος (Arr. Peripl. M. Eux. 12 , 25 ) and the Twelve Gods (Polyb. 4 . 39 . 6 , 50 . 2 ) with an altar Syll . ³ 1010 = ( I.Kalchedon 13 (C3 )). Diod. 20 . 111 . 3 (r 302 ) shows that the sanctuary belonged to Kalchedon, though it was repeatedly claimed (and sometimes also occupied) by Byzantion (no. 674 ) (Polyb. 4 . 50 . 2 -3 ). An extra-urban sanctuary of Herakles remains unlocated (Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 7 (r 409 )). His priest is attested at Syll . ³ 1011 = I.Kalchedon 10 . 4 and 11 (C3 -C2 ). There is no early evidence for the sanctuary of Artemis (Ptol. Geog . 5 . 2 ) located more likely at Phrixos (Hanell ( 1934 ) 184 ; Avram ( 1998 -2000 )) than at Chrysopolis (Merkelbach ( 1980 ) 131 ). As in the metropolis Megara (no. 225 ), the patron deity of Kalchedon was Apollo Pythios or Chresterios ( I.Kalchedon 5 . 5 ), whose priest ( προφήτας ) is mentioned in inscriptions side by side with the highest city officials: the basileus and the hieromnamon ( I.Kalchedon 7 . 3 ). His sanctuary was the oldest in the city (Luc. Pseudomantis 10 ; Dionysios of Byzantion 111 p. 35 , Güngerich; see also SEG 4 720 ) and was declared άσυλος by Delphi ( Syll . ³ 550 (C2l)). An attempt to reconstruct the local calendar,based on comparison with the other Megarian colonies, is proposed by Avram ( 1999 ) 30 . The first silver coins of Kalchedon were minted c. 387 / 6 -340 on the Rhodian standard. Types: obv . bearded head l.; rev . wheel in which ΚΑΛΧ (drachms); obv . young head l.; rev . wheel in which ΚΑΛΧ (hemidrachms); obv . bull on corn-ear l., above ΚΑΛΧ ; rev . quadripartite stippled incuse square (tetradrachms and drachms); obv . bull forepart on corn-ear l., above ΚΑ ; rev . three corn-ears (hemidrachms) (Price ( 1993 ) pl. IV 84 -111 ; SNG Cop. Bosporus-Bithynia 346 -56 ). These issues are followed c. 340 -320 by the coinage on the Persian standard. Denominations: sigloi , fifths and tenths.Types: obv . bull l. on corn-ear, above ΚΑΛΧ , sometimes ΚΑ ; rev . quadripartite mill-sail incuse square (Price ( 1993 ) pl. V 112 -26 ). For the chronology, see Le Rider ( 1963 ) 44 -50 . The close relationship to Byzantion is illustrated by the fact that the types of these series are quite similar to Byzantine types; they 'differ only in one respect, viz. that the bull on the money of Byzantium stands upon a dolphin, while at Calchedon he stands upon an ear of corn' (Head, HN ² 512 ). The sympoliteia with Byzantion of 357 is attested in the C3 -C2 bronze coins with the legend ΒΥΖΑΝ ΚΑΛΧΑ∆Ω (SchönertGeiss ( 1970 ) 78 -80 nos. 1252 -1301 pl. 59 -62 ; Price ( 1993 ) pl. IV 80 ; SNG Cop.Thrace 531 ). Kalchedon was involved in three colonial foundations, but only one of them can be considered a purely Kalchedonian colony, viz . ( 1 ) Astakos (no. 737 ), founded in C7 according to Charon of Lampsakos ( FGrHist 262 ) fr. 6 . ( 2 ) Kalchedonian participation in the foundation of Byzantion (no. 674 ) is indicated by Hesychios of Miletos (( FGrHist 390 ) frr. 20 -23 ; cf. Hanell ( 1934 ) 123 -28 ) and by the existence of the office of hieromnamon both at Kalchedon and Byzantion compared with its absence at Megara (no. 225 ) (Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 146 ). Nevertheless, the idea of a direct foundation of Byzantion by Kalchedon (Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 52 , 146 ) remains a hypothesis. ( 3 ) Jointly with Megara (no. 225 ), Kalchedon founded Mesambria in C6l, at the time of Dareios' campaign against the Scythians (Ps.-Skymnos 739 -42 ; cf. Anon. Peripl. M. Eux . 83 -84 , Diller), and in 493 the colonists were reinforced by refugees from Byzantion and Kalchedon (Hdt. 6 . 33 ); see Mesambria (no. 687 ) and Avram ( 1996 ) 290 -92 ."
744,Kallipolis (Kallipolites),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,,,477,2273,"744 . Kallipolis (Kallipolites) Map 52 . Unlocated, not in Barr . Type: A: α . The toponym is Καλλίπολις (Ps.-Skylax 93 ). Kallipolis is classified as a polis in the urban sense at Ps.Skylax 93 : Καλλίπολις καιgrave λι µ ήν , with πόλις understood before καί (Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ) and listed under the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε . The political sense is attested in the Athenian tribute lists, where the Kallipolitai are recorded under the heading πόλες ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 5 -6 , 12 , though see infra ). The settlement was presumably situated between Astakos (no. 737 ) and Kios (no. 745 ), but the exact location is not known (Ruge ( 1919 b )). The scarce evidence suggests that at an early date it was integrated into one of the neighbouring cities. In Ps.-Skylax 93 this Kallipolis is situated in Mysia and is accordingly different from (a) the Kallipolis situated on the Chersonese north of Sestos (no. 672 ) (Ptol. Geog . 3 . 11 . 9 ) and opposite Lampsakos (no. 748 ) (Strabo 13 . 1 . 18 ); (b) the Kallipolis situated on the Thracian side of the Bosporos at the so-called Anaplous (Steph. Byz. 349 . 16 ). All three cities were located in the Hellespontine district of the Delian League. In the assessment decree of 425 / 4 and in some of the tribute lists is recorded a community called Καλλιπολῖται . As the evidence stands, it is impossible to decide with which of the three cities the following information should be connected. Kallipolitai are attested in the tribute lists from 434 / 3 ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 12 ) to, possibly, 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 29 : Κ [ αλλιπολῖται ]) a total of six times, twice completely restored, paying in all years a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 87 ). In the years from 434 / 3 to 431 / 30 Kallipolis is listed under the heading πόλες αυταιgrave φόρον ταχσά µ εναι ( IG i³ 278 . vi . 5 -6 and 12 , 279 . ii . 76 -77 , 87 , 280 . ii . 68 -70 , restored). In 430 / 29 and 429 / 8 it is recorded as having been assessed by the taktai ( IG i³ 280 . ii . 74 , 281 . iii . 54 -55 , 56 , 282 . ii . 34 -36 , 37 ). In the assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 96 ) and possibly in the list of 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 29 ) Kallipolis is listed among the Hellespontine members."
745,Kios (Kianos),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.25,29.1,1266,6109,"745 . Kios (Kianos) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 25 , long. 29 . 10 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A: α . From the foundation of the city until its destruction in 202 the toponym is Κίος , ηasper (Hdt. 5 . 122 . 1 ; Hell. Oxy . 25 . 3 ; SEG 23 189 ii . 14 (C4s)). The city-ethnic is Κιανός ( I.Kios 2 . 5 (C4m) = Tod 149 ). Kios is called a polis both in the political sense ( I.Kios 1 -2 (C4 ); tentatively restored in SEG 45 208 . 5 (C4l)) and in the urban sense (Ps.Skylax 93 , where Κίος πόλις is listed under the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε ). The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested in an honorific decree of C4m ( I.Kios 2 . 5 ) and on C4 coins ( infra ). The external use is found in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 7 ). For the individual and external use,see the C4 Athenian tombstone set over two men and four women from Kios ( Agora xvii 519 ). Kios is located at modern (Turkish) Gemlik, where, in 1835 , T exier could see remains of ancient walls and scattered architectural fragments (Texier ( 1862 ) 113 ). Its territory was presumably bordered towards the north by the mountains Karlı-Da˘ gı, towards the east by the Askanian lake (I . znik Gölü),towards the south-east by Mt. Kurban-Da˘ gı, perhaps halfway between Kios and Prusa,in the area of the villages of Dürdane, Selçukgazi and Seçköy, and towards the south by the territory of Myrleia (no. 752 ) ( = the later Apameia), in the region between the villages Kur  sunlu (belonging to Apameia) and Tuzlaçiftligi (Corsten ( 1985 ) 9 -10 ). Pythopolis (no. 760 ), in C4 a Kian kome near the Askanian lake 120 stades from Kios (Arist. Mir. ausc . 834 b 34 ), has been identified with modern Sölöz, on the south shore of the I . znik Gölü (Corsten ( 1987 ) 148 -49 ) and thus indicates the limit of the Kian territory in this direction. According to Euseb. Chron . 97 b, Helm, Kios was founded in 626 / 5 . A Milesian origin is invoked as a reason for the isopoliteia between Miletos (no. 854 ) and Kios c. 228 ( Milet . i . 3 141 . 6 -7 ; cf. Plin. HN 5 . 144 ), and foundation by Miletos is further indicated by a phiale which the Kians dedicated to Apollo of Didyma in 276 / 5 ( infra ). Also, the two attested monthsΑνθεστηριών ( I.Kios 1 . 1 ) and Ληναιών ( I.Kios 27 )-suggest a Milesian origin (Samuel ( 1972 ) 117 ). According to Aristotle (Arist. fr. 519 . 1 -2 ), first a Mysian and then a Karian colony preceded the Milesian foundation of Kios. Aristotle mentions the hero Kios as the oecist of the Milesian foundation, and this tradition can be traced back to an Attic documentary relief ( IG i³ 124 ; Lawton ( 1995 ) no. 9 ) dated 406 / 5 and representing a man called ΚΙΟΣ shaking hands with the helmeted Athena (Ehrhardt ( 1995 ) 31 -33 ). According to a different tradition, Kios was founded by the Argonaut Polyphemos with Herakles' approval. This version of the foundation myth is known from Ap. Rhod. 1 . 1321 ff, 1345 -57 and 4 . 1467 ff, but its earlier origin is attested by schol. Ap. Rhod. 4 . 1470 , which quotes the C4 historian Nymphodoros of Syracuse (( FGrHist 572 ) frr. 16 bis , ter ). Nothing is known about the city's early history. Kios was under Persian domination from 547 / 6 onwards. It took part in the Ionian Revolt and was conquered by Hymaies in 497 (Hdt. 5 . 122 . 1 ). At an unknown date Kios joined the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 7 ) to 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 12 ) a total of twelve times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 48 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 89 , heavily restored).Before 408 (Xen. Hell . 1 . 4 . 7 ) Kios came under Persian control. It may have joined the Delian League once again in 406 / 5 after the Athenian victory at Arginusai (Attic relief: IG i³ 124 = Meyer ( 1989 ) 272 A 22 = Lawton ( 1995 ) no. 9 ; Ehrhardt ( 1995 ) 31 -33 ). But after 404 Kios was certainly under Persian domination (Corsten ( 1985 ) 25 ). The Aristotelian collection of constitutions included a Κιανῶν πολιτεία (Arist. fr. 519 ). Two honorific decrees, both of C4m ( I.Kios 1 , 2 ), testify to democratic institutions: a popular assembly ([ κυρία ] εκκλησία ) presided over by a prytanis , passing bills moved by boards of archontes and strategoi , and to be published in a sanctuary of Athena. The eponymous magistrate was a φρουρός ( I.Kios 1 . 1 , 2 . 1 ; cf. Corsten ( 1985 ) 50 -51 ). A board of hieropoioi ( I.Kios 1 . 15 ) and a board of, probably, synedroi ( I.Kios 25 . 3 (C4m)) are also attested. The Kianoi granted proxenia to a citizen of Sigeion (no. 791 ) ( I.Kios 1 (C4 )), and some citizens of Kios were awarded proxenia by Karthaia (no. 492 ) ( IG xii . 5 542 . 58 (C4m)). From 337 to 302 Kios was ruled by Mithridates II (Diod. 20 . 111 . 4 ; cf. Corsten ( 1985 ) 30 ; Debord ( 1999 ) 101 -2 ). C. 330 a theorodokos was appointed to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) ( SEG 23 189 . ii . 14 ). Given the Milesian origin of the city, Apollo was presumably the patron deity of Kios. The god is represented on coins ( infra ) and his cult is implicitly attested by the communal dedication of a φιάλη παραgrave Κιανῶν to Apollo from Didyma in 276 / 5 ( I.Didyma no. 427 . 6 -7 ). Kios struck coins from C4m: ( 1 ) silver drachms on the Rhodian standard, followed by ( 2 ) gold staters on the Attic standard, and ( 3 ) silver drachms, hemidrachms and quarter-drachms on the Persian standard. Types: obv . head of Apollo, r.; rev . prow ornamented with star. Legend: ( 1 ) ΚΙΑΝΩΝ , ( 2 ) signature of official, e.g. ΣΩΣΑΝ∆ΡΟΣ , ( 3 ) ΚΙΑ and signature of official. References: ( 1 ) Reinach ( 1908 ) no. 27 with pl. XLIX; Babelon, Traité ii. 2 no. 2957 , dated to c. 350 -345 (Le Rider ( 1963 ) 31 -32 ).

746,Kolonai (Koloneus?),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.2,26.55,232,1129,"746 . Kolonai (Koloneus?) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 20 , long. 26 . 55 , but not securely located, see infra . Type: B:? The toponym is Κολωναί , αιasper (Strabo 13 . 1 . 19 ; Arr. Anab . 1 . 12 . 6 ) and the cityethnic [ Κολο ] ν ˜ ες was tentatively restored in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 87 ). At Arr. Anab . 1 . 12 . 6 (r 334 ) Kolonai is called a polis in the urban sense. Strabo locates Kolonai in the territory of Lampsakos (no. 748 ) and considers it to be a Milesian colony founded inland.The settlement has been hypothetically located at Çataltepe, c. 18 km eastsouth-east of Lampsakos or, alternatively, at Arabakana˘ gi, more towards the south-east (Bürchner ( 1921 ); Leaf ( 1923 ) 101 -2 ; Frisch ( 1978 ) 106 n. 6 ) and is to be distinguished from Kolonai at Alexandria Troas, on the coast (Cook ( 1973 ) 216 -21 ). Strabo is probably wrong about Miletos (no. 854 ) as the metropolis of Kolonai, and it seems preferable to assume foundation by Lampsakos (Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 35 -36 ) followed by a later reintegration into the metropolis (Jones ( 1971 ) 86 ). For a parallel, see Paisos (no. 755 )."
747,Kyzikos (Kyzikenos),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.25,27.55,3308,16275,"747 . Kyzikos (Kyzikenos) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 25 , long. 27 . 55 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Κυacuteζικος , ηasper (Hdt. 4 . 14 . 1 ; Thuc. 8 . 107 . 1 ; Xen. An . 7 . 2 . 5 ; Milet . i . 3 137 = Staatsverträge 409 . 16 = Gawantka ( 1975 ) no. 19 (shortly after 334 )). The toponym is used about both the island and the city (Strabo 12 . 8 . 11 ). The city-ethnic is Κυζικηνός ( Milet. i . 3 137 . 4 , 8 -9 , 14 , 16 ). Kyzikos is called a polis in the urban sense at Eupolis, Poleis fr. 233 and Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 20 ; in Ps.-Skylax 94 Kyzikos is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε . For polis in the political sense, see Hdt. 4 . 15 . 1 ; Syll . ³ 4 A. 1 , B. 1 (C6l); and SEG 36 1116 .A 12 , B 8 (C4 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and externally in the C4 isopoliteia treaty with Miletos (no. 854 ) ( Milet . i . 3 137 . 4 ) and in Aen.Tact. 12 . 3 ; Dem. 50 . 6 . The individual and external use is found in a C4 dedication on Samos ( SGDI 5526 ) and in Herodotos' mention at 4 . 138 . 1 of Αρισταγόρης Κυζικηνός , the tyrant of Kyzikos in c. 513 . Patra ( = patris ) is found in CEG ii 850 ( 345 -335 ). The ancient city is located at Balkız (Turkish name), on the isthmus of the Kapu Da˘ gı peninsula (ancient Arktonnesos) jutting out from the south-west coast of the Sea of Marmara. Ps.-Skylax 94 mentions that Kyzikos was lying εν τΩsubiotaῶ ισθ µ Ωsubiotaῶ ε µ φράττουσα τοgraveν ισθ µ οgraveν , while Anaximenes of Lampsakos (( FGrHist 72 ) fr. 26 ) writes about a νηtildeσος (cf. Strabo 2 . 5 . 23 ). The confusion persists in later writers: Diod. 18 . 51 . 2 (r 319 ): χερρόνησος (cf. Steph. Byz. s.v. Κυacuteζικος ), Plin. HN 5 . 142 (relating that Alexander the Great insulam continenti iunxit in 334 ). The island of Arktonnesos became a peninsula through the construction of two parallel dykes and accumulations of sand. It is assumed that the isthmus had been connected with the mainland shortly before the first testimonies, but that the insular tradition was so strong that some writers continued to describe Kyzikos as an island (cf. Philippson ( 1910 ) 50 ; Ruge ( 1924 ) 228 ; Akurgal ( 1976 b ) 473 ). The main contribution to the topography of Kyzikos has been produced by Hasluck ( 1902 ) and ( 1910 ); for supplements see especially L. Robert ( 1955 ) 124 n. 7 ; Schwertheim ( 1978 ) 227 -28 ; Vian ( 1978 ), while some archaeological excavations (Akurgal ( 1956 ) 15 -20 ) brought to light orientalising ceramics from C7l/C6e. Unfortunately, Kyzikos remains 'the least studied of the great cities of Asia' (Mitchell ( 1999 ) 130 ) and 'its history is only illuminated by stray finds' (Mitchell ( 1985 ) 74 ), as, for example Archaic sculptural and architectural marbles from C6s (Akurgal ( 1965 ); Koenigs ( 1981 )). Moreover, there is no complete corpus of the huge number of inscriptions (list at Hasluck ( 1910 ) 263 -95 ; funerary inscriptions at Schwertheim ( 1980 ); cf. BE ( 1980 ) 389 -423 ), and only the Heltic and Roman funerary stelae have been brought together (Cremer ( 1991 )). Kyzikos controlled a large territory inhabited by the indigenous ∆ολίονες (Hecat. fr. 219 ; Strabo 14 . 5 . 29 , quoting Alexandros of Aitolia (C4 -C3 ); schol. Ap. Rhod. 1 . 943 , 961 , 1024 , 1037 ). Originally, the territory did not comprise the whole island, since at least Artake (no. 736 ) was a polis with its own territory; but Kyzikos later absorbed many other settlements which are known to have been poleis : Prokonnesos (no. 759 ) (shortly after 362 / 1 : Dem. 50 . 5 ; Paus. 8 . 46 . 4 ),Artake (no. 736 ) (perhaps about the same time), Plakia (no. 757 ) (towards the end of C4 ), Skylake (no. 761 ), T ereia (no. 763 ) and the island of Bysbikos (no. 738 ) (at latest in C4 ) and the satrap's residence of Daskyleion (at latest in the early Heltic period: Robert and Robert ( 1976 ) 231 with n. 321 , 232 -35 ). At an unknown date the western limit between the territories of Kyzikos and Priapos (no. 758 ) was at the unlocated ταgrave Αasperρπάγια τόπος (Strabo 13 . 1 . 11 ; see Harpagion (no. 742 )). More toponyms are recorded by Steph. Byz. s.v. Μέλισσα ( 442 . 16 -17 ), Ποι µ ανηνόν ( 530 . 9 -10 ), and Σκυacuteρ µ ος ( 579 . 14 ). Poimanenon is surely late (first mention c. 80 : Kaufmann and Stauber ( 1992 ) 45 ) and so may the other settlements be. For later extensions of the territory of Kyzikos, see Jones ( 1971 ) 86 -88 , 94 . Kyzikos was founded by Miletos (no. 854 ) (Anaximenes of Lampsakos ( FGrHist 72 ) fr. 26 ). Two dates are given for the foundation year: 756 (Euseb. Chron . 88 b, Helm) and 679 (ibid. 93 b).Assuming a 'double colonisation' ,some scholars have accepted the earlier date (Graham ( 1958 ) 32 , ( 1971 ) 39 -42 , ( 1983 ) 107 ), but the archaeological record supports only the second (Akurgal ( 1956 ) 15 , 19 , ( 1976 b ) 474 ; Laubscher ( 1963 -64 ) 74 ; Kiechle ( 1959 -60 ) 96 ; Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 42 , 49 -50 ; Cremer ( 1991 ) 9 ). Thus Kyzikos-together with Prokonnesos, the earliest colony in the Propontismust have been founded c. 680 . Alföldi ( 1991 ) 137 suggests an overland expedition from Miletos to Kyzikos. Kyzikos came under Persian domination after 547 and was included in the third satrapy ruled from Daskyleion. A failed attempt to establish a tyranny is recorded under Kyros (Ath. 1 . 30 A),while about 514 / 13 Aristagoras of Kyzikos is mentioned among the Hellespontine tyrants (Hdt. 4 . 138 . 1 ). Kyzikos took part in the Ionian Revolt but was subjected by Oinobares, the satrap in Daskyleion (Hdt. 6 . 33 . 3 ). About 478 it joined the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . v . 30 ) to 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 10 ) a total of thirteen times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 4 , 320 dr. in 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 95 ), but 9 tal. from 443 / 2 on ( IG i³ 269 . ii . 23 ). A change of the constitution towards democracy is to be assumed thanks to Athenian influence (see the prytanies of the phylai ). The change may perhaps be connected with the story told at Arist. Oec . 1347 b 30 -34 : after a stasis the demo- cratic faction got the upper hand over the oligarchs; but instead of killing their opponents, they exacted a ransom and had them exiled. In 411 Kyzikos defected from Athens (Thuc. 8 . 107 . 1 ), but was soon reconquered (Xen. Hell . 1 . 11 , 14 , 16 -18 ). After the Peloponnesian War Kyzikos was allied with or perhaps even controlled by Sparta (no. 345 ) (Xen. Hell . 3 . 4 . 10 , An . 7 . 2 . 5 ) and took part in the symmachia with Rhodes (no. 1000 ), Knidos (no. 903 ), Iasos (no. 891 ), Ephesos (no. 844 ), Samos (no. 864 ), Byzantion (no. 674 ) and Lampsakos (no. 748 ) (Karwiese ( 1980 ), but cf. Debord ( 1999 ) 273 -77 for a date post-394 ). In consequence of the King's Peace, Kyzikos may have been subject to Persia for a short time after 387 / 6 . If we can trust schol. Dem. 21 . 173 ( 586 , Dilts), Kyzikos seems to have joined the Second Athenian Naval League, and in 364 Timotheos assisted Kyzikos when besieged by, probably, a Persian satrap (Diod. 15 . 81 . 5 ; Nep. Timoth . 1 . 2 ). Shortly afterwards, in 362 , Kyzikos, like Kalchedon (no. 743 ) and Byzantion (no. 674 ), captured Athenian merchantmen (Dem. 50 . 6 ). During the Social War ( 357 -355 ) the Athenians captured Kyzikos' merchantmen (Dem. 21 . 173 ); Kyzikos then broke with Athens (schol. Dem. 21 . 173 ). An alliance with Kalchedon at an unknown date in C4f, perhaps in the 360 s, is attested by the fact that Kyzikene soldiers assisted the city of Kalchedon during a siege (Aen.Tact. 12 . 3 ; P Oxy . 303 , perhaps also Arist. Oec . 1347 b 20 -30 ). At the beginning of Alexander's campaign Kyzikos was unsuccessfully besieged by the satrap Memnon (Diod. 17 . 7 . 3 ; Polyaen. 5 . 44 . 5 ). An isopolity treaty with Miletos (no. 854 ) ( Milet . i . 3 137 = Gawantka ( 1975 ) no. 19 ) is attested shortly after 334 (Ehrhardt ( 1987 ) 114 -16 ) but may go back to C5 or even earlier (Graham ( 1983 ) 117 , cf. 107 -8 ; Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 235 -38 ). Citizens of Kyzikos were awarded proxenia by Karthaia (no. 492 ) ( IG xii . 5 542 . 54 -55 (C4m)) and Chios (no. 840 ) ( PEP Chios 50 . 12 (C4 )). Local inscriptions (starting with Michel 533 . 1 ( c. 390 )) produce evidence for all the six Milesian phylai : Geleontes, Aigikoreis, Argadeis, Hopletes, Boreis, Oinopes (Jones, POAG 287 -90 ; Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 384 n. 24 ) and for the six φυacuteλαρχοι (Michel 596 . 3 ; Hasluck ( 1910 ) 250 -51 ; Bilabel ( 1920 ) 120 -21 ; Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 107 -9 ). A popular assembly ( δηtilde µ ος ) and a council ( βουλή ) are attested in a probouleutic decree of C4 ( BCH 13 ( 1889 ) 514 -18 ). Assembly and council were presided over by monthly shifting prytaneis belonging to one of the six tribes, so that each tribe must have been in prytany twice during a year (Michel 533 ( c. 390 ); Hasluck ( 1910 ) 251 -52 and 266 with the list of inscriptions). There was a prytanarch . Meetings of the demos were chaired by a daily epistates assisted by a grammateus (Michel 533 ; cf. Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 100 ; Rhodes, DGS 415 -17 ). The original eponymous magistrate may have been a πρυacuteτανις (unattested, but highly probable by reason of the Milesian model: Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 194 -95 ). In C4f the eponymous magistrate was an archon ( SGDI 5523 , perhaps attesting some passing Athenian influence; see Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 195 ). From about C4m he was replaced by a ιasperππάρχης (Michel 596 ), perhaps in connection with the conquest of neighbouring communities (Hasluck ( 1910 ) 254 -55 , cf. 304 -5 : list of the attested eponyms). Other officials are a board of strategoi (Michel 596 . 2 (C4f)) and hieromnemones ( SGDI 5523 . 3 (C4m)). Kyzikos had no walls in 410 when the city was attacked by Athens (Thuc. 8 . 107 . 1 ; Diod. 13 . 40 ), but the Athenians presumably fortified the city since it was taken by the Spartans and Persians in 410 'after a siege' ( πολιορκεῖν , Diod. 13 . 49 . 4 ). Defensive walls are attested in a building inscription of C4f (Michel 596 ) and their existence can be inferred from the account of the siege of Kyzikos in 364 (Diod. 15 . 81 . 5 ; Nep. Timoth . 1 . 2 ). The evidence of public architecture is remarkably rich. A prytaneion is mentioned in a dedication of C6l ( Syll . ³ 4 . 5 -6 ). An honorific decree of C3e (Michel 534 ) refers to a theatre ( 12 , 21 ; TGR iii. 390 ), an agora ( 14 ), and a Doric stoa ( 24 : προgrave τηtildeς στοαtildeς τηtildeς ∆ωρικηtildeς ), which indicates that these monuments existed at least in C4l if not earlier. A temple ( νεώς ) is attested by an inscription of C6 recording the building of its roof by means of the income produced by the sacred lands and the sale of the skin of sacrificed animals (Robert and Robert ( 1950 ) 78 -80 ). At Kyzikos was located 'the earliest sanctuary in Asia' for Athena ( Anth. Pal . 6 . 342 . 5 -6 ), which is perhaps to be identified with the οasperacuteρος Αθηναtildeς (cf. Hasluck ( 1910 ) 236 ) and with the τέ µ ενος τηtildeς Α [ θηναtildeς τηtildeς Πολιάδος ] ( SEG 28 953 . 79 ; for the restoration, see Sève ( 1979 ) 359 n. 189 ). Strabo 12 . 8 . 11 records two harbours, one on either side of the two bridges that connected the island with the mainland (Lehmann-Hartleben ( 1923 ) 63 -64 , 262 -63 ; L. Robert ( 1955 ) 122 -25 with pls. XXI no. 2 , XXII nos. 1 -2 ). The channels between the bridges formed a kind of 'third' harbour (Philippson ( 1910 ) 50 ), presumably identical with the λι µ ήν mentioned at schol.Ap.Rhod. 1 . 940 and the λι µ ήν recorded by Syll . ³ 799 . ii . 2 (Sève ( 1979 ) 349 -51 ). For the topography, see Hasluck ( 1902 ) pl. XI: plan by R. de Rustafjaell; cf. L. Robert ( 1955 ) 122 -25 . The western harbour has been identified (Sève ( 1979 ) 351 ) with the Χυτοgraveς λι µ ήν recorded at schol. Ap. Rhod. 1 . 987 a (quoting the local writer Deiochos). Minor harbours belonging to the Kyzikene territory were at Panormos (schol. Ap. Rhod. 1 . 954 : Πάνορ µ ος λι µ ηgraveν τηtildeς Κυζίκου ), located at modern Bandırma (Lehmann-Hartleben ( 1923 ) 293 n. 4 ) and Bathys Limen, which could be sought at Artake (no. 736 ) or on the north coast of the island, in the area of the village of Kerek (Greek Vathy): cf. L. Robert ( 1955 ) 128 -31 ; Sève ( 1979 ) 351 n. 132 . Kyzikos'patron deity was Apollo (Hecat.fr. 217 ; SNG Cop. Mysia 43 , 57 ; cf. Hasluck ( 1910 ) 228 -32 ; Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 135 ). In addition to Athena Polias ( supra ), there is evidence for an Athena called ΣΩΤΕΙΡΑ on a coin (Imhoof-Blumer ( 1890 ) 614 no. 168 ), and her worship is also attested by Ap. Rhod. 1 . 955 . A very popular civic cult, at least from C4 onwards, was that of Kore with the epithet soteira (App. Mithr . 75 ) attested on C4 coins ( SNG Cop. Mysia 53 -56 , 58 -62 , infra ). Other communal cults are attested by various sources: Γηtilde Καρ [ ποφόρος ] (Delphic oracle for Kyzikos: SGDI 2970 ; Hasluck ( 1910 ) 221 and 301 . 4 -5 ; perhaps also on coins from C5 : SNG Deutschland. Nachträge ii 7320 ); Poseidon (with various epikleseis in Heltic and later inscriptions summarised by Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 475 n. 886 ; depicted on coins from c. 450 to C4 , e.g. SNG Deutschland. Nachträge ii no. 7310 ); Kybele (Hdt. 4 . 76 . 2 -3 ); Pan (Michel 533 = Hasluck ( 1910 ) 264 no. 4 ( c. 390 ); on coins from c. 450 to C4 ( SNG Deutschland. Nachträge ii 7319 )); the hero Herakles (Archaic relief: Akurgal ( 1961 ) 239 ). There is also evidence for some civic festivals: a festival for Kybele (Hdt. 4 . 76 . 3 ) and the Anthesteria for Dionysos (Michel 534 = Hasluck ( 1910 ) 264 no. 5 . 20 , 27 ; SEG 28 953 . 52 -53 ). Through Ap. Rhod. 1 . 936 ff a foundation myth can be traced back to the local writer Deiochos (C5l-C4f). He tells the story of Kyzikos,the young king of the Doliones who was killed by a terrible mistake by Jason.The hero Kyzikos can be recognised on electrum coins of C5f ( BMC Mysia 21 no. 23 ). On the other hand,a Milesian origin of the city is also attested in the Classical period (Anaximenes of Lampsakos ( FGrHist 72 ) fr. 26 and Kyzikos' isopolity treaty with Miletos). The Kyzikene calendar was identical with the Milesian (Samuel ( 1972 ) 116 ; cf. Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 116 ) apart from the month Boudion = Milesian Boedromion (Schwertheim ( 1986 ) 13 -14 (C4 ); cf. Knoepfler ( 1997 ) 359 , 412 n. 56 ). Outside Kyzikos Boudion is attested only at Apollonia on the Rhyndakos (Abmeier ( 1990 ) 5 ). Kyzikos possessed a practical monopoly of coining the so-called Kyzikenes. From C6f to C4 , they were the most important currency in the area from Troy to Ionia, in the Propontis, in Bithynia and in the Black Sea regions (Alföldi ( 1991 ) 129 -34 ). Kyzikos struck electrum staters weighing c. 16 g from c. 550 (Mildenberg ( 1993 -94 ) 7 ) until after 322 / 1 (Touratsoglou ( 1999 ) 353 , 356 -57 ). Denominations: electrum staters, one-sixth staters and a few smaller fractions (Head, HN ² 522 ). On the exchange rate of the Kyzikenes, see Bogaert ( 1977 ). Types: obv . c. 240 different types (Jenkins and Castro Hipolitò ( 1989 ) 61 ), perhaps changing every year (Mildenberg ( 1993 -94 ) 3 , 7 ), but all with the tunny fish as the main type or later as an adjunct type (Head, HN ² 523 ; Kiechle ( 1959 -60 ) 97 ); rev . quadripartite incuse square ( SNG Cop. Mysia 35 -44 ). Kyzikos also struck silver coins from c. 550 -530 onwards (Mannsperger ( 1989 ) nos. 2206 -8 , pl. 80 ) and bronze coins from c. 400 (Fritze ( 1917 )). Denominations: obols and their divisions in C6 -C5 , tetradrachms on the Rhodian weight standard in C4 , small fractions in bronze. C5 types: obv . forepart of boar, behind, tunny; rev . lion's head in incuse square; legend: on some Κ reversed. C4 : obv . Kore Soteira; legend: ΣΩΤΕΙΡΑ ; rev . various types all with a tunny; legend: ΚΥΖΙ . Strabo 13 . 1 . 12 records a tradition that Kyzikos founded Priapos (no. 758 ). Taking a strange coincidence revealed by the calendars into consideration ( supra ), another Kyzikene foundation might have been Apollonia on the Rhyndakos ( supra 975 ). In both cases primary Milesian foundation is the alternative (and perhaps more likely) explanation."
748,Lampsakos (Lampsakenos),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.1,26.2,2558,12453,"748 . Lampsakos (Lampsakenos) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 10 , long. 26 . 20 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Λά µ ψακος , ηasper ( LSAG p. 367 no. 47 ; Hecat. fr. 220 ; Dem. 50 . 19 ). Before the colonisation of Lampsakos in C7m the toponym seems to have been Πιτυόεσσα (Charon of Lampsakos ( FGrHist 262 ) fr. 7 a) or Πιτυacuteεια (Hom. Il . 2 . 829 ; schol. Ap. Rhod. 1 . 933 ; Steph. Byz. 410 . 18 , quoting Deiochos of Kyzikos (C5 -C4 )). It is possible that the Homeric Πιτυacuteεια existed before the proper foundation of Lampsakos ( infra ). The city-ethnic is Λα µ ψακηνός ( I.Lampsakos 1 . 20 ( c. 300 )). Lampsakos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 5 . 117 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 19 ; in Ps.Skylax 94 Lampsakos is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε ) and in the political sense ( I.Lampsakos 1 . 20 ( c. 300 ), 8 . 2 -4 (C4 ?); Arist. Oec . 1347 b 1 ; Hdt. 4 . 137 . 2 , 138 . 1 , list of tyrants with the heading: εasperacuteκαστος αυτῶν τυραννευacuteει πόλιος ). The collective use of the cityethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ) and in inscriptions ( I.Lampsakos 1 . 20 ) and externally at Hdt. 6 . 37 -38 ; Thuc. 8 . 62 . 2 ; Xen. An . 7 . 8 . 1 ; IG i³ 269 . ii . 10 . For the individual and external use, see Hdt. 4 . 138 . 1 ; Thuc. 6 . 59 . 3 ; Aeschin. 2 . 83 . The citizens are referred to as politai (Arist. Oec . 1351 b 4 ). Patris is found in Dem. 23 . 142 . Lampsakos is located at modern Lapseki (Turkish name), which has preserved the ancient toponym. Some testimonies of the eighteenth century attest walls and architectural remains (but Texier ( 1862 ) 174 -76 reported that he found no ancient monument in 1835 ), while various objects continue to be found occasionally: Leaf ( 1923 ) 93 -97 ; Bürchner ( 1924 b ) 591 ; MacKay ( 1976 ) 480 and map 7 ; Mitchell ( 1999 ) 142 . The best evidence is produced by inscriptions (Frisch ( 1978 )), but almost all are of the Heltic and Roman periods. The territory of Lampsakos was originally called Βεβρυκία after the name of the native Βέβρυκες (Charon ( FGrHist 262 ) fr. 8 ; cf. fr. 7 a). The countryside was renowned for its vineyards (Thuc. 1 . 138 . 5 ; Diod. 11 . 57 . 7 (r 464 )). The territory (Bürchner ( 1924 a ); Frisch ( 1978 ) 105 -7 ) was bordered to the west by Perkote (no. 788 ) ( = modern Umurbey) situated c. 12 km from Lampsakos, and to the north-east by Paisos, c. 12 km from Lampsakos and incorporated after 425 / 4 (see Paisos (no. 755 )).According to an anecdote told by Polyaen. 6 . 24 the frontier between Lampsakos and Parion (no. 756 ) was placed at Hermaion = modern Otlukdere, c. 10 km south of Parion, according to Leaf ( 1923 ) 100 -1 to be identified with Hermoton (Arr. Anab . 1 . 12 . 6 ); contra Ruge ( 1942 b ) 2436 ; Frisch ( 1978 ) 105 n. 5 . There is evidence of a number of settlements in the territory of Lampsakos. Κολωναί was probably a dependent polis (Arr. Anab . 1 . 12 . 6 (r 334 ); Strabo 13 . 1 . 19 ) and perhaps a secondary colony founded by Lampsakos (see no. 746 ). Μυρ µ ισσός (Steph. Byz. 164 . 8 -9 , quoting Polemon: πόλις περιgrave Λά µ ψακον ) and ' Ιωλκός (schol. Eur. Med . 484 ) were perhaps situated close to Lampsakos. Αacuteβαρνος or Αβαρνίς was a settlement near the homonymous promontory (Hecat. fr. 220 ; Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 29 ; Ephor. fr. 46 ), tentatively located c. 8 km north of Lampsakos, at Çardak Burnu (Leaf ( 1923 ) 93 ); according to Steph. Byz. 4 . 4 , it was a polis . Other settlements are attested only in late sources. Lampsakos was founded in 654 / 3 (Euseb. Chron . 95 d, Helm; Synkellos 213 b, p. 402 , Dindorf) by colonists from Phokaia (no. 859 ) (Charon of Lampsakos ( FGrHist 262 ) fr. 7 a and b; Polyaen. 8 . 37 ; Steph.Byz. 4 . 13 -14 , quoting Ephor.fr. 46 ). That Phokaia was the metropolis is confirmed by the tradition that the citizens of Lampsakos called themselves brothers of the Massaliotai (cf. Massalia (no. 3 ), so a Phokaian colony; I.Lampsakos 4 . 26 ), and by the name of the month Heraion, attested both in Lampsakos ( I.Lampsakos 8 . 5 ) and Phokaia (Samuel ( 1972 ) 125 , 131 ). Strabo 13 . 1 . 19 erroneously states that Lampsakos was colonised from Miletos (no. 854 ). In C6m Lampsakos was a dependency of Lydia,and when the Lampsakenes had captured Miltiades, the Athenian tyrant of the Chersonese, they were forced by Kroisos to set him free (Hdt. 5 . 37 -38 ). After the fall of Lydia in 547 , Lampsakos came under Persia; in 499 the city joined the Ionian cities in their Revolt, and the winged horse on Lampsakos'coins was used by the Ionian koinon on some of their issues (Meiggs ( 1972 ) 27 ); but Lampsakos was conquered by Daurises in 498 or 497 (Hdt. 5 . 117 ). Lampsakos remained under Persian domination,and in 464 it was given by King Artaxerxes to the exiled Themistokles (Thuc. 1 . 138 ; Plut. Them . 27 . 1 , 29 . 11 ). At an unknown date Lampsakos joined the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . v . 17 : [ Λα µ φσακ ] ενοί ) to 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 pars aversa 37 ) a total of thirteen times, three times completely restored, paying in most years a phoros of 15 tal. ( IG i³ 262 . iv . 5 ), in 447 / 6 reduced to 3 , 600 dr. ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 59 ) and in 442 / 1 to 9 tal. ( IG i³ 270 . ii . 6 ). It was perhaps assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 176 , completely restored). The quota of 12 tal. would suggest that the income from the gold mines was taken into account (Ruschenbusch ( 1983 ) 143 ). After 430 / 29 the citizens of Paisos (no. 755 ) were moved to Lampsakos (Strabo 13 . 1 . 19 : οιasper δεgrave Παισηνοιgrave µ ετΩsubiotaώκησαν εις Λά µ ψακον ), and Kolonai (no. 746 ) may have suffered a similar fate. Lampsakos supported Athens during the first stages of the Peloponnesian War,then went over to the Persians (who wereallies of the Spartans); but in 411 the city was conquered by the Athenian strategos Strombichides (Thuc. 8 . 62 ) and continued to be allied with Athens (Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 18 ). It was conquered by Lysandros in 405 shortly before Aigos potamoi (no. 658 ) (Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 18 -21 , 30 and 2 . 2 . 1 ). The city remained under Spartan hegemony until the mid-390 s (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 2 -5 ). Some Lampsakene gold staters ( obv . Herakles strangling the serpents, infra ) indicate that Lampsakos in 394 presumably joined the so-called Herakles Coinage Alliance between Rhodes (no. 1000 ), Knidos (no. 903 ), Iasos (no. 891 ), Ephesos (no. 844 ), Samos (no. 864 ), Byzantion (no. 674 ) and Kyzikos (no. 747 ) (Seltman ( 1933 ) pl. 32 . 12 ; Cawkwell ( 1956 ); Karwiese ( 1980 ), dating the alliance to the last years of the Peloponnesian War; Frisch ( 1978 ) 122 ; Debord ( 1999 ) 273 -77 ). Like all other cities of Asia Minor,Lampsakos fell to Persia by the King's Peace of 387 / 6 . Together with other Hellespontine cities, it belonged to the satrapy ruled from Daskyleion, conceded by Ariobarzanes to the hyparchos Philiskos of Abydos, who was killed by two citizens of Lampsakos (Dem. 23 . 142 ). During the Social War ( 357 -355 ) Lampsakos was conquered by the Athenian strategos Chares (Dem. 2 . 28 ; schol. Dem. Olynth . 3 . 31 ), and in the 340 s it was ruled by Memnon of Rhodes (Arist. Oec . 2 . 1351 b 1 ; cf. Frisch ( 1978 ) 127 ). From c. 310 onwards Lampsakos was a member of the κοινοgraveν τῶν ' Ιλιέων (L. Robert ( 1966 ) 18 -46 ). Moreover, a kind of sympoliteia with Ilion (no. 779 ) is probably attested by a unique silver tridrachm: obv . head of Athena wearing Corinthian helmet, r.; rev . winged horse r. under the horse: ΛΑΜ ( ΨΑΚΗΝΩΝ ), above it: ΙΛ ( ΙΕΩΝ ) (Frisch ( 1975 ) XV, ( 1978 ) 129 -30 ( c. 300 )). A tradition that Lampsakos was originally ruled by kings is reported by Charon of Lampsakos (( FGrHist 262 ) fr. 7 ab). After the Persian conquest, c. 513 , Lampsakos was ruled by a tyrant, Hippoklos (Hdt. 4 . 138 . 1 ). His son Aiantides married Archedike, the daughter of Hippias, the tyrant of Athens (Thuc. 6 . 59 . 3 ), and the epigram on Archedike's gravestone (Thuc. 6 . 59 . 3 = I.Lampsakos 24 a (C5e)) testifies to a third generation of tyrants (Frisch ( 1978 ) 113 -14 ). We have no further information about the constitution of Lampsakos until C4f, when we hear about another tyrant,Astyanax, who was overturned and killed (Aen. Tact. 31 . 33 , tentatively dated to c. 355 by Berve ( 1967 ) 313 ). A few years later a pupil of Plato, Euaion, held the acropolis as security for a public debt. He attempted to set up a tyranny, but was eventually paid off and expelled (Ath. 508 F; cf. Berve ( 1967 ) 312 -13 ). Inscriptions attesting democratic institutions all belong in the Heltic period; see especially I.Lampsakos 4 . 34 . Only I.Lampsakos 1 and 8 may perhaps be dated as early as C4 (for the date of 8 , see Wilhelm ( 1974 ) 46 -48 ). In these inscriptions we learn about a popular assembly called demos ; cf. the statue of Anaximenes of Lampsakos set up in Olympia by τῶν Λα µ ψακηνῶν τουtilde δή µ ου (Paus. 6 . 18 . 2 (rC4s)). Furthermore, the inscriptions mention a council ( boule ), a tamias , a board called οιasper επιgrave τηsubiotaηtilde διοικήσει , and an envoy elected by a show of hands (Rhodes, DGS 412 -14 ). In 346 a citizen of Lampsakos was sent by the Odrysian dynast Kersobleptes to Athens (Aeschin. 2 . 83 ). Citizens of Lampsakos became proxenoi at Chios (no. 840 ) (Vanseveren ( 1937 ) 325 A. 10 -11 (C4m)),at Epidauros (no. 348 ) ( IG iv² . 1 51 (C4 )) and at Athens (no. 361 ) ( IG ii² 205 ( 351 / 50 )). In C4s Lampsakos had a theorodokos to host theoroi from Nemea ( SEG 36 331 .B. 26 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). The acropolis of Lampsakos is mentioned at Ath. 508 F (r 350 ). The city was not yet fortified when it was conquered by the Athenians in 411 (Thuc. 8 . 62 . 2 ), and the first defence circuit was erected by the Athenians under Thrasyllos and Alkibiades in 409 (Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 14 ; cf. Diod. 13 . 66 ). These walls are also mentioned by Plut. Lys . 9 . 5 in connection with the conquest of the city by the Spartan commander in 405 . The city also had a harbour (Strabo 13 . 1 . 18 ). The patron deity was Priapos (Paus. 9 . 31 . 2 ; cf. the testimonies collected by Frisch ( 1978 ) 150 -52 ).A cult of Dionysos is attested through the mention of a sanctuary for Dionysos in I.Lampsakos 8 . 6 -7 ; cf. 34 . 34 -35 . A local agon is known from a C5 bronze hydria inscribed αtildeθλον εγ Λα µ ψάκο ( LSAG ² 367 no. 47 ). The earliest coins of Lampsakos (Head, HN ² 529 -30 ) are electrum staters of c. 525 -500 . Types: obv . forepart of winged horse (Pegasos), above, acanthus; rev . quadripartite incuse square.After an interruption,Lampsakos started again from c. 450 to strike electrum staters of two main types ( 1 ) obv . forepart of winged horse, sometimes in vine wreath; rev . quadripartite incuse square; ( 2 ) obv . Janiform female head of Archaic style; rev . head of Athena in incuse square. Between the two series there was an issue of lighter standard, interpreted as a local coinage connected with the Ionian Revolt (Baldwin ( 1914 ); Gaebler ( 1922 ); for the coinage of the Ionian Revolt: Gardner ( 1911 ), ( 1918 ) 91 -103 ; Meiggs ( 1972 ) 441 -42 ; cf. IGCH no. 1167 ). The later series of electrum staters is also mentioned in the Athenian accounts of the Parthenon as χρυσ ˜ ο στατ ˜ ερες Λα µ φσακενοί ( IG i³ 436 -49 ( 447 / 6 -433 / 2 )). The local gold mines mentioned in Polyaen. 2 . 1 . 26 (r 396 ) must have provided the metal for the gold staters struck c. 390 -330 on the Persian standard. Obv . different types; one is the infant Herakles strangling the serpents (cf. supra ); Baldwin ( 1920 ) and, for the chronology, Baldwin ( 1924 ); rev . forepart of a winged horse in incuse square (Head, HN ² 529 -30 ). The C4 gold staters, referred to as χρυσίω Λα µ ψακανῶ στ [ ατεῖραι ] ( IG vii 2418 . 9 = Syll . ³ 201 ) became almost an 'international' currency (Baldwin ( 1924 ); Regling ( 1924 ) 590 ; SNG Cop. Mysia 187 ). Furthermore, from C6l to C4 (and later) Lampsakos struck silver staters and smaller fractions sometimes on the Persian,sometimes on the Attic standard (Gaebler ( 1923 ); cf. Le Rider ( 1963 ) 51 , 55 ). Bronze coins were struck in C4 . Obv . heads of different deities; rev . mostly forepart of winged horse; legend: ΛΑΜ or ΛΑΜΨΑ ( SNG Cop. Mysia 180 -86 , 188 -98 )."
749,Metropolis,The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,,,120,590,"749 . Metropolis Map 52 . Unlocated. Not in Barr . Type: B: α . The toponym is Μητρόπολις ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 8 -9 ). Our only source for this community is the Athenian assessment decree of 422 / 1 in which Metropolis is recorded among the Hellespontine members ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 8 -9 : Μετρόπολις παραgrave Πρίαπον ). Thus, the Athenians claimed that the community was a member of the Delian League and had it assessed for a tribute of 1 tal. The Greek name suggests that it was a colonial foundation and a polis . It was situated on the south coast of the Propontis near Priapos (no. 758 )."
750,Miletoupolis (Miletopolites),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.05,28.2,657,3503,"750 . Miletoupolis (Miletopolites) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 05 , long. 28 . 20 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: α . The toponym is Μιλητουacuteπολις , ηasper (Strabo 12 . 8 . 10 ; Suda Μ 1061 ). The cityethnic is Μιλητοπολίτης ( SNG Cop. Mysia 249 ) or Μιλητοπόλιος ( I.Kyzikos ii 64 (second century ad )). The earliest attestation of Miletoupolis as a polis comes from a decree of the first century ad ( I.Kyzikos ii 25 . 2 ). But polis status in the Archaic and Classical periods is strongly indicated by ( 1 ) the toponym, ( 2 ) the C4mint, and ( 3 ) the cult of Zeus Polieus. The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested on C4 coins ( infra ). For the individual and external use, see an Athenian sepulchral inscription of C4f ( SEG 18 120 ) and a C3Milesian citizenship decree ( Milet . i . 3 67 . 7 ). Combining Strabo 12 . 8 . 10 with the evidence of coin finds, it is now generally assumed that Miletoupolis was at modern Melde (Turkish name), c. 5 km north-west of Mustafakemalpa  sa (formerly Kirmasti) (Schwertheim ( 1983 ) 89 -92 ). Some excavations took place in 1975 , but only Roman monuments were found (ibid. 90 , 127 -28 ). The Turkish name Melde derives from Miletos, through Meletos (L. Robert ( 1962 ) 192 ). The territory of the city was bordered to the north by the mountains Kara Da˘ gları (including Lake Miletopolitis which belonged to the city (Strabo 12 . 8 . 10 )), to the west by the hills situated east of Lake Daskylitis, to the south by the Rhyndakos valley, and to the east by Lake Apolloniatis, which belonged to the later Apollonia on the Rhyndakos (L. Robert ( 1980 ) 97 -98 ; Schwertheim ( 1983 ) 100 -1 ). At the western end of this lake lay Miletou Teichos (no. 751 ), a fortified settlement ( Hell. Oxy . 25 . 3 ) and in C4 probably a dependency of Miletoupolis. The foundation of Miletoupolis is not mentioned in any source. Some late coins inscribed ΜΕΙΛΗΤΟΣ ΚΤΙΣΤΗΣ indicate that the city was named after a hero founder called Miletos (Schwertheim ( 1983 ) 81 nos. 28 -29 ). According to Nikolaos of Damaskos ( FGrHist 90 ) fr. 63 , this Miletos, probably a Milesian, married into the Lydian royal family but went into exile and came first to Daskyleion (no. 740 ), later to Prokonnesos (no. 759 ). If we can trust these late sources, Miletoupolis was a Milesian colony and probably founded in C7l/C6e (Schwertheim ( 1983 ) 102 -6 ). The types used for the coins, the calendar used by the Miletopolitai ( infra ), as well as a late sepulchral inscription referring to 'Attic blood'( I.Kyzikos II 64 (second century ad )) testify to close ties with Athens. A C4festival calendar ( I.Kyzikos ii 1 ; cf. Schwertheim ( 1983 ) 107 -12 ) mentions cults of Hermes, Aphrodite, Zeus Polieus,Olympios and Agoraios,Apollo Karneios,Herakles, (Herakles) Alexikakos, Eirene and Ilithyia (midwife goddess). However, the possibility remains that the stone is a pierre errante recording the calendar of an Attic deme (Habicht ( 1999 ) 26 -29 ). The calendar records sacrifices in the month of Skirophorion, elsewhere attested only in Athens and Iasos (Trümpy, Monat . 294 ) and thus points to Athenian influence.The head of Athena on the earliest coins ( infra ) may indicate a cult of Athena. Miletoupolis struck bronze coins from C4 onwards (Head, HN ² 531 ; Schwertheim ( 1983 ) 78 nos. 1 -6 and 8 ). Types: obv . head of Athena, or young male, r.; rev . bull, or owl; legend: ΜΙΛΗ , ΜΙΛΗΤΟ or ΜΙΛΗΤΟΠΟΛΕΙΤΩΝ ( BMC Mysia 91 nos. 1 -5 ; SNG Cop. Mysia 246 -47 )."
751,Miletouteichos (Miletoteichites),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.15,28.25,582,3057,"751 . Miletouteichos (Miletoteichites) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 15 , long. 28 . 25 . Size of territory: ? Type: B: α . The toponym is Μιλητουτεῖχος ( Hell . Oxy . 25 . 3 ; SEG 23 189 . ii . 16 ( c. 330 )). The city-ethnic is, possibly, Μιλητοτειχίτης ( IG i³ 100 . iii . 5 ( 410 / 9 )); see infra . There is no reference to Miletouteichos as a polis in any source, but polis status in the Classical period is indicated by membership of the Delian League and the attestation in C4s of a theorodokos . Miletouteichos was completely unknown until the discovery first of the Hell. Oxy . and then of the C4s list of Argive theorodokoi ( SEG 23 189 ). In Hell . Oxy . 25 . 3 , Chambers, we learn that Agesilaos in 395 on his march from Kios (no. 745 ) to Phrygia attacked a place called Miletou Teichos,but failed to take it and then marched along the river Rhyndakos to Daskyleion (no. 740 ). In the Argive theorodokoi list of c. 330 Miletouteichos is listed after Kios and Brylleion ( = Myrleia) and before Iasos ( SEG 23 189 . ii . 16 ). These two sources are still the only ones we have, but a third can be added if, in the Athenian assessment decree of 410 / 9 ( IG i³ 100 . iii . 5 ), we accept the restoration Μιλητο [ τειχῖται ] instead of Μιλητο [ πολῖται ] in the editio princeps : Hesperia 5 ( 1936 ) 387 (see Schwertheim ( 1983 ) 107 ). The relationship between the two toponyms Miletoupolis and Miletouteichos is a moot point. Some scholars have assumed identity between Miletouteichos and Miletoupolis (Charneux ( 1966 ) 217 -18 ; Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 43 ; Debord ( 1999 ) 250 ). That the two toponyms denote different sites has been argued forcefully by Schwertheim ( 1983 ) 95 -99 , followed by Barr ., Map 52 . Miletouteichos should be placed north-west of Lake Apolloniatis,according to Barr . at modern Uluabat, a location which fits the description of Agesilaos' march route in Hell. Oxy . Schwertheim ( 1983 ) 98 -99 prefers to identify Miletouteichos with the later Apollonia on the Rhyndakos = modern Gölyazı. A possible reconstruction of our sources is that, after Alkibiades' naval victory at Kyzikos in 410 , Miletouteichos was founded as an Athenian colony and incorporated into the Delian League (Meiggs ( 1972 ) 369 , 438 -39 ; Schwertheim ( 1983 ) 107 ; Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 43 ). It was probably an Athenian settlement and, at first, independent of the neighbouring poleis . In C4 , on the other hand, the fortified settlement may have become a dependency of neighbouring Miletoupolis (no. 750 ); and the Athenian influence on Miletoupolis' coinage and calender indicates a fusion of the population of the two settlements. Since the appointment of a theorodokos was an act of a polis rather than of a fortress (Perlman ( 2000 ) 45 -60 ), the presence of a theorodokos in Miletouteichos c. 330 indicates that Miletouteichos was a (dependent) polis and not just a fortress lying in the territory of Miletoupolis. For the polis status of a teichos , cf. e.g. Neon Teichos (no. 824 ), one of the eleven Aiolian poleis (Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 , 150 . 2 )."
752,Myrleia (Myrleanos),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.2,28.55,730,3574,"752 . Myrleia (Myrleanos) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 20 , long. 28 . 55 . Size of territory: ? Type: [A]: α . The toponym is either Βρυacuteλλειον ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 112 ; SEG 23 189 . ii . 15 ) or, later, Μυacuteρλεια , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 94 ; Strabo 12 . 3 . 22 ). The corresponding city-ethnics are Βρυλλεανός ( IG i³ 280 . ii . 18 ) and Μυρλεανός (on coins, infra ). Both Brylleion ( SEG 23 189 . ii . 15 ) and Myrleia (Strabo 12 . 4 . 3 ) are attested as neighbours of Kios (no. 745 ). Stephanos ( 187 . 13 -14 ) quotes Ephor. fr. 45 for the view that Brylleion is identical with Kios: /acuteΕφορος δεgrave εν τΩsubiotaῶ ε ´ Κίον αυτήν φησιν εῖναι . The error disappears if one for Κίον reads Κίου : 'Ephoros says that it (Brylleion) belongs to Kios'; that Brylleion/Myrleia in C4 was a dependency of Kios is stated at Diod. 20 . 111 . 4 , if one accepts Post's conjecture Μυρλείας for Μαρίνης (see Corsten ( 1987 ) 8 with n. 4 ). The identification of Brylleion and Myrleia as successive names of the same settlement is based on two observations: ( 1 ) all references to Brylleion concern C5 -C4 , whereas attestations of Myrleia belong in C4s-C2 ; ( 2 ) both names are variants of the same (barbarian?) toponym: change of β into µ , and metathesis ρυ &gt; υρ (Corsten ( 1987 ) 4 -6 ). Since the first coins, of C4s, have the legend ΜΥΡΛ , Corsten assumes that Myrleia became the official name shortly after c. 330 . In 202 Myrleia was destroyed by Philip V of Makedonia and refounded as Apameia (Strabo 12 . 4 . 3 ). In Ps.-Skylax 94 Myrleia is the first toponym listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε where polis is used in the urban sense. That Myrleia was a polis in the political sense too is strongly indicated by its coinage and its membership of the Delian League.The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested on the coins ( infra ), the external use is attested in an Attic decree of 304 / 3 ( IG ii² 703 . 10 ). For the individual and external use,see the numerous references to Ασκληπιάδης οasper Μυρλεανός (C3 -C2 ) (Ath. 50 D). Myrleia is located at Mudanya (Turkish name), c. 20 km west of Kios (for some earlier descriptions, see Texier ( 1862 ) 113 -15 ; Perrot ( 1872 ) 12 -14 ). According to Ps.-Skylax 94 , Myrleia belonged to Phrygia; later it was part of Bithynia. Myrleia was colonised by Kolophon (no. 848 ). The testimonies are late but leave no doubt: Pompon. 1 . 99 ; Plin. HN 5 . 143 ; Steph. Byz. 463 . 18 . The foundation year is not attested. Brylleion was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 18 ) to 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 23 ) a total of four times, paying a phoros of 3 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 18 ). It is absent from the full panel of 442 / 1 ( IG i³ 270 . i . 35 -ii . 30 ). From 337 to 302 both Kios and Myrleia were ruled by Mithridates II (Diod. 20 . 111 . 4 , as emended by Post). From C4l to C3Myrleia (Bryllion) belonged for a short time to the κοινόν of the sanctuary of Athena Ilias (L. Robert ( 1966 ) 31 -33 , 39 ). C. 330 a theorodokos was appointed to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) ( SEG 23 189 . ii . 15 ). The first coins were minted at a time when the official name of the city was Myrleia, i.e. C4 -C3 . Reinach ( 1908 ) 247 -49 distinguished twenty-seven types: obv . heads of different gods, also wheel, humped bull, horseman, lyre, corn wreath, etc.; rev . legend: ΜΥΡΛΕΑ , ΜΥΡΛΕΑΝΩΝ or ΜΥΡΛ , sometimes with monograms (names of magistrates?); cf. Head, HN ² 510 ."
753,Olbia,The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,,,311,1612,"753 . Olbia Map 52 . Unlocated. Type: [A]: α . The toponym is ' Ολβία (Ps.-Skylax 93 ; cf. Ptol. Geog . 5 . 1 . 2 and Steph. Byz. 475 . 16 , 489 . 5 ). Olbia is classified as a polis in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 93 : ' Ολβία καιgrave λι µ ήν , with πόλις understood before καί (Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ) and listed under the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε . Ps.Skylax includes Olbia among the poleis in Mysia, whereas Steph. Byz. 489 . 5 describes Olbia as a πόλις Βιθυνίας . Some scholars argue that Olbia should be identified with Astakos (no. 737 ) and that the change of name from Astakos to Olbia took place in 435 in connection with an Athenian settlement (Ruge ( 1896 ) 1774 ; but cf. Ruge ( 1937 ); Jacoby, FGrHist ii D pp. 565 -66 ). Olbia is identified with Nikomedia by Steph.Byz. 475 . 15 -16 , followed by Tscherikower ( 1927 ) 46 ; Hanell ( 1934 ) 121 ; Marek ( 1993 ) 15 . Both identifications, however, are contradicted by Ptol. Geog . 5 . 1 . 2 , which lists Astakos, Olbia and Nikomedia side by side. The preferable view seems to be that Olbia was a settlement in the territory of first Astakos, later Nikomedia. Whatever the position of Olbia, the settlement had some importance, as the Gulf of Astakos was also called ' Ολβιανός (Ps.-Skylax 92 ; Pompon. 1 . 100 ). Nothing is known about the history of the city. Olbia seems at an early date to have been incorporated into, probably, Astakos. In spite of the lack of evidence, Olbia might have been founded by Megara (no. 225 ), since the whole neighbouring region belonged to the area of Megarian colonisation."
754,(Otlenoi),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,,,141,619,"754 . (Otlenoi) Map 52 . Unlocated, not in Barr . Type: C:? The city-ethnic is ' Οτλενός . The only explicit evidence concerns the ethnic and comes from the Athenian tribute lists. In the assessment decree of 422 / 1 , among the Hellespontine members is recorded a community called Otlenoi paying a tribute of 2 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 6 ). On the basis of this entry [ ' Οτλενοί ] has been restored in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 116 ) and [ ' Οτλε ] νο [ ί ] in the tribute list of 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . iii . 1 ). Nothing more is known about the community (Ruge ( 1942 a ); ATL i. 529 )."
755,Paisos (Paisenos),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.25,26.5,536,2491,"755 . Paisos (Paisenos) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 25 , long. 26 . 50 . Size of territory: presumably 1 or 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Παισός (Hdt. 5 . 117 ), ηasper (Eust. Il . i 558 . 8 -9 ). The city-ethnic is Παισηνός ( IG i³ 272 . i . 32 ). Paisos is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 5 . 117 . The external and collective use of the city-ethnic is attested in the Athenian tribute lists. Paisos has tentatively been located at Fanous (Turkish name Fanar on R.Kiepert's map), c. 12 km east-north-east of Lampsakos (no. 748 ), at the extreme north point of the coast, c. 30 km west of Parion (no. 756 ) (Leaf ( 1923 ) 99 -100 and photo pl. V A; Ruge ( 1939 ) 559 , ( 1942 b ) 2435 ; Frisch ( 1978 ) 105 n. 4 ). The river Paisos could be modern Bairam Çayı (Karanly Dere on Kiepert's map: Ruge ( 1939 ) 559 ). The relationship with Homer's Παισός ( Il . 2 . 828 , 5 . 612 ) remains obscure (Strabo 13 . 1 . 10 , 19 ; Steph. Byz. 102 . 16 ; Eust. Il . i 558 . 8 -9 ). Paisos was colonised by Miletos (no. 854 ) (Anaximenes of Lampsakos ( FGrHist 72 ) fr. 26 ), presumably in C7like the other Milesian colonies in the Propontis. In 499 Paisos joined the Ionian cities in their revolt against Persia and was subjected by Daurises in 498 or 497 (Hdt. 5 . 117 ). The city was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . viii . 5 ) to 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 28 ) a total of twelve times, once completely restored, paying in all years a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 260 . viii . 5 ). It was presumably assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 90 ). According to Strabo, Paisos was destroyed and the citizens moved to Lampsakos (Strabo 13 . 1 . 19 : κατέσπασται ηasper πόλις . οιasper δεgrave Παισηνοιgrave µ ετΩsubiotaώκησαν εις Λά µ ψακον ). The destruction of Paisos can be dated to the period c. 425 -350 : in the tribute lists Paisos is not recorded later than 430 / 29 and is missing from the full (?) list of 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 ). But so is Priapos (no. 758 ), and if the [ Παισε ] νοί are correctly restored in IG i³ 71 . iii . 5 , the terminus post quem must be 425 / 4 . The fact that Paisos is not mentioned between Parion and Lampsakos in the list of Hellespontine poleis in Ps.Skylax 94 indicates a terminus ante quem of C4m.Leaf ( 1923 ) 100 suggests that Paisos fell to Lampsakos after the competition between Parion and Lampsakos reported in Polyaen. 6 . 24 (rC4 )."
756,Parion (Parianos),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.25,27.0,1552,7413,"756 . Parion (Parianos) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 25 , long. 27 . 00 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Πάριον , τό (Archestratos fr. 7 . 2 , Olson and Sens; IG i³ 71 . iii . 98 ; Xen. An . 7 . 2 . 7 ). The city-ethnic is Παριανός ( CID ii 5 . ii . 2 ( 358 )). Parion is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 5 . 117 . 1 , and in Ps.-Skylax 94 Parion is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε . For the political sense, see Hdt. 4 . 138 . 1 : ' Ηρόφαντος Παριηνός in a list of tyrants with the heading: εasperacuteκαστος αυτῶν τυραννευacuteει πόλιος ( 4 . 137 . 2 ). The earliest explicit attestation of Parion as a polis in the political sense is at Diod. 20 . 111 . 3 (r 302 ). The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested on coins ( infra ). The external use is attested in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 260 . x . 4 ) and in Xen. An . 7 . 3 . 16 . For the individual and external use, see the C5m Athenian proxeny decree for one or more citizens of Parion ( IG i³ 18 ) and the C4m sepulchral monument ( IG ii² 10045 (C4m)). Parion is located at modern Kemer (Turkish name),northeast of the mouth of the river Kemer Dere. Here some ancient remains were found in 1801 by P. Hunt and J. D. Carlyle (Walpole ( 1818 ) 87 -88 ; Ewers ( 1822 ) 427 -30 ), in 1835 by Texier (( 1862 ) 174 ), and in 1978 marble blocks including uninscribed stelae were found on the acropolis (Frisch ( 1983 ) 54 ). Since Asia Minor was never clearly subdivided into political and/or geographical regions, Parion is variously placed in Phrygia (Ps.-Skylax 94 ), in the Troas (Strabo 13 . 1 . 4 , quoting Eudoxos of Kyzikos, Damastes of Sigeion and Charon of Lampsakos), in Mysia (Ptol. Geog . 5 . 2 . 2 ), in the Propontis (Strabo 10 . 5 . 7 ; Eust. Comm. Dionys. Per . 517 ), in the Hellespont (Hdt. 4 . 138 . 1 ; Steph. Byz. 505 . 13 ) and in the Hellespont or the Propontis (Strabo 7 fr. 58 ). The territory of Parion was called Παριανή (Anaximenes ( FGrHist 72 ) fr. 25 ). It was bordered to the west by Paisos (no. 755 ) but after the integration of this city into Lampsakos (no. 748 ) in C5l-C4m Parion and Lampsakos became neighbours, with the frontier between the two cities at ' Ερ µ αῖον , 70 stades from Parion and 200 stades from Lampsakos (Polyaen. 6 . 24 ; see supra 976 ). To the east Parion bordered on Priapos (no. 758 ). According to Euseb. Chron . 91 b, Helm,Parion was founded in 709 ; cf. Ath. 116 A-D. The sources disagree about the metropolis : Erythrai (no. 845 ) and 'Ionia' (Paus. 9 . 27 . 1 ); Thasos (no. 526 ) (Eust. Comm. Dionys. Per . 517 ); Paros (no. 509 ) (Strabo 10 . 5 . 7 ); Miletos (no. 854 ), Erythrai and Paros (Strabo 13 . 1 . 14 ). Since the toponym Parion is obviously derived from Paros,there can be no doubt that Paros was the main coloniser (Frisch ( 1983 ) 60 ), while the version concerning Thasos may be explained by the fact that Thasos was a foundation of Paros; but in that case the foundation year 709 must be lowered, because Thasos itself was founded c. 710 -680 (Pouilloux ( 1954 ) 24 ; Frisch ( 1983 ) 59 ). Erythraian participation is supported by the officials called εξετασταί ( I.Parion 1 . 22 ) attested also in Erythrai ( I.Erythrai 201 c. 46 ), but not at Miletos and Paros (Bilabel ( 1920 ) 49 ; Frisch ( 1983 ) 59 ). Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 36 also adduces the name Damalis as an onomastic link between the two cities. Strabo's error about the foundation of Lampsakos discredits his information about Parion. For an attempt to harmonise all these traditions, see Burn ( 1935 ) 132 with n. 7 . Parion must have come under Persian domination after 547 , and in reference to c. 514 / 13 Herophantos of Parion is mentioned among the Hellespontine tyrants by Hdt. 4 . 138 . 1 . Parion took part in the Ionian Revolt (Hdt. 5 . 103 ), but by chance it escaped being conquered by Daurises in 497 (Hdt. 5 . 117 . 1 ). Parion joined the Delian League, perhaps in 478 / 7 . It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 15 ) to 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 15 ) a total of fourteen times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of first 1 tal. ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 15 ), reduced to 2 , 000 dr. in, probably, 443 / 2 ( IG i³ 269 . ii . 19 ), but raised again to 1 tal. in 435 / 4 ( IG i³ 277 . v . 4 ). It was presumably assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 71 ). During the Peloponnesian War Parion supported Athens ( ATL ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 13 ). The Attic proxeny decree for Phanokritos of Parion, who revealed the plans of the Spartan fleet to the Athenians ( 387 / 6 ), suggests that Parion continued to be an ally of Athens during the Corinthian War ( IG ii² 3822 = Syll . ³ 137 ). Parian envoys to the Odrysian king Medokos are mentioned by Xen. An . 7 . 3 . 16 (r 400 ). By the King's Peace of 387 / 6 Parion fell to Persia, and c. 360 it was besieged and conquered by Iphiades of Abydos (Aen. Tact. 28 . 6 -7 ). City walls ( τείχη ) and their gates ( πυacuteλαι ) are attested by Aen.Tact. 28 . 6 -7 in his account of the conquest of Parion by Iphiades of Abydos ( c. 360 ). In 1801 the walls of Parion still stood, and were built of large blocks of squared marble without mortar (Hunt and Carlyle quoted by Frisch ( 1983 ) 54 ). The existence of a harbour is implicitly suggested by Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 13 (r 410 ) and explicitly mentioned by Strabo 13 . 1 . 14 . There is no evidence about public architecture in Parion with the exception of an extra-urban oracular sanctuary ( µ αντεῖον ) of Apollo Aktaios and Artemis at Adrasteia. Possibly in C4 it was demolished, and the marble was reused for the altar of Apollo Aktaios at Parion, a work of Hermokreon (Strabo 13 . 1 . 13 ; cf. 10 . 5 . 7 and bronze coins of c. 350 -300 , infra ); cf. Leaf ( 1923 ) 84 -85 ; L. Robert ( 1966 ) 43 -44 . The most important god of the city was Apollo Aktaios, whose position as the protective deity of Parion is later attested by a silver tetradrachm of c. 150 bearing the legend ΑΠΟΛΛΩΝΟΣ ΑΚΤΑΙΟΥ ΠΑΡΙΑΝΩΝ ; cf. Seyrig ( 1958 ) 611 -12 ; L. Robert ( 1966 ) 43 ; Price and Trell ( 1977 ) 121 . Of other communal cults attested in later sources, there is evidence for pre-Heltic worship of Eros (Paus. 9 . 27 . 1 ), because his statue was made by Praxiteles (Plin. HN 36 . 22 ) before 354 (Wolters ( 1913 ); Mirone ( 1921 ); L. Robert ( 1966 ) 43 -44 ; Bonacasa ( 1976 )), and for Priapos, of Lampsakene origin and very popular in the whole region (Robert and Robert ( 1950 ) 80 -93 ), who acquired a local epiklesis in Parion (Hsch. s.v. Παριανός . εξ επιθέτου Πρίαπος ). Parion struck electrum coins of the Gorgoneion type from C5e (Head, HN ² 531 ; Babelon ( 1950 ) 42 , with a too early date). In C5e the city also started to strike silver coins. Types: obv . Gorgoneion; rev . incuse square containing a cruciform pattern: e.g. BMC Mysia pl. 21 . 6 , dated to c. 500 -475 (Price and Waggoner ( 1975 ) 84 ; SNG Cop. Mysia 256 ). C. 350 -300 (Le Rider ( 1963 ) 53 -55 ) Parion struck silver hemidrachms on the Persian standard.Types: obv . bull looking back,with various symbols; legend: ΠΑ ΡΙ ; rev . Gorgoneion ( SNG Cop. Mysia 257 -67 ). A series of bronze coins may be dated to c. 350 -300 or later. Types: obv . bull; rev . the great altar of Parion built by Hermokreon ( supra ) (Head, HN ² 531 ; SNG Cop. Mysia 270 -71 )."
757,Plakia (Plakianos),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.25,28.15,357,1820,"757 . Plakia (Plakianos) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 25 , long. 28 . 15 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: β . The toponym is Πλακία (Ps.Skylax 94 ). The city-ethnic is Πλακια ( νός ) ( SNG Cop. Mysia 545 ), in Ionian Πλακιηνός (Hdt. 1 . 57 . 3 ). Plakia is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 94 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on C4 coins ( infra ) and externally by Hdt. 1 . 57 . 3 . Plakia is placed in Phrygia by Ps.-Skylax 94 , in the Hellespontine region by Steph. Byz. 525 . 14 . Describing the coast from west to east, Pompon. 1 . 98 and Plin. HN 5 . 142 mention Plakia as an oppidum after Kyzikos (no. 747 ) and before the river Rhyndakos, and they also write that the Mt. Olympos was behind it ( a tergo ). Consequently, Plakia has tentatively been located at Kur  sunlu (Turkish name),halfway between the isthmus of Kyzikos and the mouth of the river Rhyndakos (Philippson ( 1913 ) map 3 ; Schmidt ( 1950 )). Plakia is described by Herodotos as a semi-barbarian community in which Pelasgians lived side by side with Athenians ( 1 . 57 . 2 ) (cf. Dion. Hal. Ant . Rom . 1 . 29 ). In Ps.Skylax 94 Plakia is listed under the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε . Herodotos'account implies that Plakia,in so far as it was a Hellenic community,was an Athenian foundation.Plakia may have been incorporated into Kyzikos,the end of the local coinage being a terminus post quem . Plakia introduced into the region the worship of Kybele under the name of Μήτηρ Πλακιανή . The head of the goddess, sometimes turreted, appears on the obverse of the small bronze coins dated to C4 . The reverse has the legend ΠΛΑΚΙΑ or ΠΛΑΚΙ or ΠΛΑ and a lion to r., or a lion's head, or a walking bull (Imhoof-Blumer ( 1871 ) 375 -76 ; Head, HN ² 537 ; SNG Cop. Mysia 543 -45 )."
758,Priapos (Priapenos),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.25,27.2,724,3346,"758 . Priapos (Priapenos) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 25 , long. 27 . 20 . Size of territory: probably 2 or 3 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Πρίαπος (Thuc. 8 . 107 . 1 ; IG i³ 77 . iv . 9 ), οasper (Strabo 13 . 1 . 4 , 11 ) or ηasper (Strabo 13 . 1 . 14 ; Steph. Byz. 535 . 3 ). The city-ethnic is either Πριαπηνός ( SNG Cop. Mysia 548 (C3 ); IG xii . 8 184 . 5 (C1 )) or Πριαπευacuteς ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 11 ). Priapos is called a polis in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 94 , where πόλις εστιgrave Πρίαπος is listed under the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε . The only attestation of polis in the political sense is at Arr. Anab . 1 . 12 . 7 (r 334 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( SNG Cop. Mysia 548 (C3 )) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 11 ). The only attestation of the individual and external use is in a C1list of mystai from Samothrake ( IG xii . 8 184 . 5 ). Ps.-Skylax 94 lists Priapos among the poleis in Phrygia, whereas Strabo 13 . 1 . 4 , quoting Eudoxos, states that the region of Troas begins at Priapos. Priapos is located at modern Karabiga (Turkish name), north-west of the mouth of the river Granikos = modern Kocaba  s Çayı. LehmannHaupt ( 1918 ) 429 -31 and Leaf ( 1923 ) 73 -75 reported some ancient remains, especially traces of a harbour at Kale Burun, to be identified with the harbour of Priapos mentioned at Strabo 13 . 1 . 12 and 14 . Some late inscriptions have been found by chance: Le Bas and Waddington ( 1870 ) nos. 1750 -51 ; Legrand ( 1893 ) 549 -50 no. 45 ; Lehmann-Haupt ( 1918 ) 430 ; BE ( 1972 ) 362 (to add some of the monuments belonging to Priapos but included in the Kyzikene corpus by Schwertheim ( 1980 ): nos. 337 , 426 , 444 , 458 ; cf. BE ( 1980 ) 395 ). The territory was originally contiguous with the territories of Parion (no. 756 ) and Lampsakos (no. 748 ) (Strabo 13 . 1 . 11 ) to the west, and to Kyzikos (no. 747 ) to the east (Strabo 12 . 4 . 6 ; cf. 13 . 1 . 11 ). According to the traditions paraphrased by Strabo 13 . 1 . 12 , Priapos was founded either by the Milesians (no. 854 ) contemporaneously with Abydos (no. 765 ) and Prokonnesos (no. 759 ), or by Kyzikos (no. 747 ). The synchronism with Abydos and Prokonnesos suggests a date of C7e. Priapos joined the Delian League, presumably from the beginning. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 13 ) to 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 . ii . 17 -18 ) a total of thirteen times, once completely restored, paying in all years a phoros of 500 dr. ( IG i³ 266 . i . 18 ). It was presumably assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 97 ). It is recorded sometimes by toponym ( IG i³ 266 . i . 18 ) and sometimes by city-ethnic ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 11 ). Priapos was involved in some war operations at sea in 411 (Thuc. 8 . 107 . 1 ). It fell to Persia by the King's Peace of 386 / 7 , and in 334 it willingly opened its gates to Alexander the Great (Arr. Anab . 1 . 12 . 7 ). The city is called after its patron divinity Priapos (Strabo 13 . 1 . 12 ), whose cult was originally limited to the Propontis (Herter ( 1954 ) 1914 ; L. Robert ( 1979 ) 263 -64 ), and Priapos constitutes a rare case of the toponym being identical with, and not derived from, the name of the god (Herter ( 1954 ) 1915 )."
759,Prokonnesos (Prokonnesios),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.35,27.3,1119,5666,"759 . Prokonnesos (Prokonnesios) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 35 -40 , long. 27 . 30 -45 . Size of territory: 3 ( 110 km ² ). Type: A: α . The toponym is Προκόννησος , ηasper (Hdt. 4 . 14 . 2 ; Dem. 18 . 302 ; IG ii² 10113 (C4 )), the name of the city being identical with that of the island (Ps.-Skylax 94 ). The city-ethnic is Προκοννήσιος ( IG i³ 1508 . 4 (C6m) from Sigeion; I.Lampsakos 26 . 2 (C4 )). Prokonnesos is attested as a polis both in the political sense (Hdt. 4 . 15 . 1 ) and in the urban sense (Hdt. 4 . 14 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 94 , where πόλις Προκόννησος is listed under the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε ). For the political sense, see also Hdt. 4 . 138 . 1 : Μητρόδωρος Προκοννήσιος in a list of tyrants with the heading εasperacuteκαστος αυτῶν τυραννευacuteει πόλιος ( 4 . 137 . 2 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the coins ( infra ) and externally in a reference to the Prokonnesioi as Athenian allies (Dem. 50 . 6 ). For the individual and external use, see the Ionian-Attic monument from Sigeion ( IG i³ 1508 . 4 (C6m)) and the Prokonnesian attested in the Karthaian list of proxenoi ( IG xii . 5 542 . 57 (C4m)). The city is located on Marmara island (Mermeradası in Turkish), north-west of the Kyzikene peninsula. Strabo 13 . 1 . 16 makes a distinction between ancient Prokonnesos (which could be the island of Halone, in front of Kyzikos: Frisch ( 1983 ) 50 ) and contemporary Prokonnesos. The ancient urban centre (not recorded in Barr .) was in the south-west part of the island (Danoff ( 1974 ) 560 ). The territory of Prokonnesos comprised the whole island (Gedeon ( 1895 ); Hasluck ( 1909 ) 9 -13 ; Danoff ( 1974 ) 560 ; L. Robert ( 1978 ) 327 -28 ) and was famous for its marble (Strabo 7 fr. 55 , 13 . 1 . 16 ). The remains of the quarriesdescribed by Texier ( 1862 ) 161 -62 , Hasluck ( 1909 ) 11 -13 and Holbach ( 1909 )-are now meticulously researched by N. Asgari (Mitchell ( 1990 ) 88 -89 , ( 1999 ) 129 -30 ). In C4f Prokonnesos controlled a neighbouring island called Elaphonnesos (Ps.-Skylax 94 ). According to later authors, Elaphonnesos and Prokonnesos were the same island (Danoff ( 1974 ) 560 ). Prokonnesos was founded by the Milesians (no. 854 ) contemporaneously with Priapos (no. 758 ) and Abydos (no. 765 ) (Strabo 13 . 1 . 12 ). For various etymologies of the toponym, see schol. Ap. Rhod. 2 . 279 . Prokonnesos may indeed belong to the first stage of Milesian colonisation of the Propontis together with Abydos and Priapos, both founded c. 670 (Loukopoulou ( 1989 ) 46 , 48 ; Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 38 suggests a date close to that of Kyzikos' foundation, C7e). Under Persian control after 547 , Prokonnesos was in c. 513 ruled by Metrodoros, recorded among the Hellespontine tyrants at Hdt. 4 . 138 . 1 . The city took part in the Ionian Revolt and was burnt by the Phoinikian fleet in 493 (Hdt. 6 . 33 . 2 ). At an unknown date it joined the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 17 ) to 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 14 ) a total of fourteen times, paying in all years a phoros of 3 tal. ( IG i³ 271 . i . 33 ). It was perhaps assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 103 , completely restored).Prokonnesos remained loyal to Athens during the Peloponnesian War, and in 410 Alkibiades used its harbour as his base for the operations leading to the battle of Kyzikos (Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 13 , 18 -20 ). Persian domination after the King's Peace in 387 / 6 is to be assumed,but in 362 the Prokonnesians are once again attested as allied with Athens (Dem. 50 . 5 ). After a war with Kyzikos (no. 747 ) in 362 / 1 , Prokonnesos was conquered, and some citizens were moved to Kyzikos (Dem. 50 . 5 ; Paus. 8 . 46 . 4 ; cf. Moggi, Sin . 341 -44 ), but Prokonnesos was not destroyed (L. Robert ( 1967 ) 17 -18 ), and in 340 it appears as an ally of Athens in the war against Philip of Makedonia (Dem. 18 . 302 ). Also Προκοννήσιοι , i.e. citizens of Prokonnesos, are attested in the Heltic period ( SEG 30 551 . 3 , 34 604 (C3 ); see L. Robert ( 1967 ) 19 -21 ). Prokonnesos was probably allowed to persist as a dependency of Kyzikos, i.e. as a dependent polis . A citizen of Prokonnesos was appointed proxenos by Karthaia (no. 492 ) in C4m ( IG xii . 5 542 . 57 ). Some names derived from Apollo may suggest that the patron deity was Apollo, as in other Milesian colonies (Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 40 ). The cult of Kybele is attested by Paus. 8 . 46 . 4 : having conquered Prokonnesos, the Kyzikenes moved the cult statue ( άγαλ µ α ) of Mother Dindymene (i.e. Kybele) from Prokonnesos to Kyzikos. The coinage of Prokonnesos (Head, HN ² 537 -38 ) has been redated by Thompson ( 1965 ) and subdivided into four series. ( 1 ) C. 450 -425 , denomination: silver hemiobols on the Persian standard. Types: obv . forepart of a horse; rev . oinochoe within an incuse square. ( 2 ) C. 411 -387 / 6 , denomination: silver hemidrachms on the Persian standard. Types: obv . different types of female head to l., presumably Aphrodite; rev . oinochoe; legend: ΠΡΟΚΟΝ . ( 3 )-( 4 ) After c. 387 / 6 on the Rhodian standard. ( 3 ) Denominations: tetradrachms, drachms and fractions; small fractions in bronze.Types: obv . female head, r.; rev . stag or stag's forepart (silver), or oinochoe,or dove; legend: ΠΡΟΚΟΝ , names of magistrates except on smaller bronze coins. ( 4 ) Denominations: hemidrachms, trihemiobols and small bronzes of the same basic types,but without names and subsidiary symbols. The date of the last coinage is given by the incorporation of Prokonnesos into Kyzikos ( SNG Cop. Mysia 551 -58 )."
760,Pythopolis (Pythopolites),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.25,29.25,271,1369,"760 . Pythopolis (Pythopolites) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 25 , long. 29 . 25 . Size of territory: ? Type: B:? The toponym is Πυθόπολις (Arist. Mir. ausc . 834 b 34 ; Menekrates ( FGrHist 701 ) fr. 1 ). The city-ethnic is Πυθοπολίτης ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 7 ). The toponym as well as the membership of the Delian League suggest that Pythopolis was originally a polis , but at Arist. Mir. ausc . 834 b 34 it is classified as a kome . The presumption is that the polis Pythopolis was subdued by Kios (no. 745 ) and turned into a civic subdivison. Ps.-Aristotle locates Pythopolis on the Askanian lake ( = I . znik Gölü), 120 stades from Kios, and considers it a 'village' , apparently a second-order settlement in the territory of Kios. According to Menekrates ( FGrHist 701 ) fr. 1 , it was close to the river Soloeis. A combination of these two sources suggests a location at the village of Sölöz, on the south shore of I . znik Gölü (Corsten ( 1987 ) 148 -49 ). The Pythopolitai are recorded among the Hellespontine members in the Athenian assessment decree of 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 7 ), and the city-ethnic is restored in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 117 ). Thus,the Athenians claimed that they were members of the Delian League. According to Menekrates ( FGrHist 701 ) fr. 1 , Pythopolis had been founded by Theseus and named after the Pythian Apollo."
761,Skylake,The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.25,28.25,266,1366,"761 . Skylake Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 25 , long. 28 . 25 . Size of territory: ? Type: C: β . The toponym is Σκυλάκη (Hecat. fr. 218 ; Hdt. 1 . 57 . 2 ). The only attestation of a city-ethnic is at Steph. Byz. 579 . 4 . Quoting Hekataios,Steph.Byz. 579 . 3 -4 states that Skylake was a polis near Kyzikos: Σκυλάκη . πόλις περιgrave Κυacuteζικον . ' Εκαταῖος ΑσίΩsubiotaα . There is no reason to doubt the location, but we have no guarantee that the site-classification stems from Hekataios (Hansen ( 1997 ) 17 -18 ). Thus, the main reason for including Skylake in this Inventory of poleis is the analogy with Plakia (no. 757 ): like Plakia, Skylake is described by Hdt. 1 . 57 . 2 as a semi-barbarian community in which Pelasgians lived side by side with Athenians. Herodotos'account implies that Skylake, in so far as it was a Hellenic community, was an Athenian foundation. From the information provided by Steph. Byz. 579 . 3 -4 , Pompon. 1 . 98 , Plin. HN 5 . 142 , and Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica 3 . 34 -36 , we must presume that Skylake was situated near Plakia at the mouth of the river Rhyndakos (Lolling ( 1882 ) 152 n. 2 ). Philippson ( 1913 ) map 2 located Skylake at Yeni Köy, on the coast, c. 12 km west of the mouth of the Rhyndakos. The city seems to have disappeared very early (Bürchner ( 1927 )), and was presumably integrated into Kyzikos (no. 747 )."
762,Sombia,The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,,,276,1328,"762 . Sombia Map 52 . Unlocated. Not in Barr . Type: B:? The toponym is Σο µ βία , ηasper ( IG i³ 285 . ii . 86 ). Sombia was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 21 ) and is recorded in the tribute lists in 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 . ii . 23 ), in 421 / 0 ( IG i³ 285 . ii . 86 ) and in 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 21 ), paying a phoros of 4 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 285 . ii . 86 , amount partly restored). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 113 , partly restored) and in 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 3 ) for 4 , 000 dr. The position of Sombia in the lists strongly suggests that, within the Hellespontine district, it was located somewhere in the Propontis, rather than in Troas or Chersonesos. Further specification is impossible. In the assessment decrees Sombia is listed together with communities lying on the south coast (Tereia (no. 763 ), Artaiou Teichos (no. 735 ), Otlenoi (no. 754 )), but in the tribute lists it is placed among communities, some of which were on the north coast (Daunion Teichos, Serrion Teichos and Perinthos) and some on the south coast (Myrleia and, probably, Didymon Teichos). The evidence slightly favours a position on the south coast, but is-strictly speaking-inconclusive. So a location on the north coast is equally possible."
763,Tereia,The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.25,28.45,149,694,"763 . Tereia Map 52 . c. Lat. 40 . 25 , long. 28 . 45 , unlocated in Barr . Size of territory: ? Type: C:? Τηρεία is recorded among the Hellespontine members in the Athenian assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 111 -12 : [ Τ ] ερεία παραgrave [ Βρ ] υacuteλλιον ), and the toponym is restored in the assessment decree of 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 1 -2 ). Thus, the Athenians claimed that Tereia was a member of the Delian League. According to the evidence of the assessment decree, Tereia was situated east of Kyzikos near Myrleia and must accordingly be different from the Tereia mentioned by Strabo at 12 . 4 . 6 as lying west of Kyzikos ( ATL i. 476 ; Charneux ( 1966 ) 211 -12 )."
764,Zeleia (Zeleites),The Propontic Coast of Asia Minor,40.15,27.35,948,4398,"764 . Zeleia (Zeleites) Map 52 . Lat. 40 . 15 , long. 27 . 35 . Size of territory: ? Type: A:? The toponym is Ζέλεια ( Il . 2 . 824 ; Dem. 9 . 43 ; IG i³ 271 . ii . 38 ). The city-ethnic is Ζελείτης ( IG ii² 8526 . 1 (C4s)). Zeleia is called a polis in the urban sense in the local decree SGDI 5532 = Syll . ³ 279 . 25 , and in the political sense in the same inscription ( 15 , 19 , 39 ) and in SGDI 5533 a-b, d-e (both from c. 334 ). In both inscriptions are attested the cognate terms politai ( Syll . ³ 279 . 3 , 7 , 28 ) and politeia ( SGDI 5533 a-d). The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested on coins ( infra ), the external sense in Arr. Anab . 1 . 17 . 2 (r 334 ). For the individual and external use, see the references to Αacuteρθ µ ιος Πυθώνακτος Ζελείτης (Dem. 9 . 42 -43 ; Aeschin. 3 . 258 ; Din. 2 . 24 ; cf. Meiggs ( 1972 ) 508 -12 ). Strabo locates Zeleia 190 stades from Kyzikos and 80 stades from the sea ( 13 . 1 . 10 ), at the foot of Mt. Ida ( 13 . 1 . 5 , 33 ), which was for him rather a mountain range separating Troy from Mysia (Texier ( 1862 ) 41 ). The site has been identified with Sari Köy (Turkish name), on the Sari Çayı, a left-bank tributary of the river Aisepos ( = Gönen Çayı): Philippson ( 1910 ) map 1 ; Hasluck ( 1910 ) 101 -3 ; Leaf ( 1923 ) 66 -67 ; ATL i. 488 . Noreliable reconstruction of the extent of Zeleia's territory can be obtained from Strabo's contradictory accounts at 12 . 4 . 6 , 13 . 1 . 10 , 17 , 45 . For an attempt, see Haussoullier ( 1902 ) 107 -8 . Nothing certain is known about the foundation of Zeleia. It was not a Milesian colony (Bilabel ( 1920 ) 47 -49 ; Ehrhardt ( 1988 ) 38 ). Early Ionian Helation of a pre-existing settlement is sometimes presumed (Bilabel ( 1920 ) 49 ; cf. L. Robert ( 1967 ) 122 ; Herrmann ( 1981 ) 17 n. 48 ). At an unknown date in C5 Zeleia began to collaborate with Athens, at least through one of its citizens (Meiggs ( 1972 ) 508 -12 ), and in 441 / 40 the city occurs once in the tribute lists among the Hellespontine members ([ Ζέ ] λεια : IG i³ 271 . ii . 38 ). The toponym is completely restored in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 102 ). Under Persian domination from, at latest, the King's Peace of 387 / 6 , Zeleia supported the Persians against Alexander the Great in 334 but obtained an amnesty from the conqueror (Arr. Anab . 1 . 17 . 2 ). Some decrees passed in the wake of the battle of Granikos testify to a democratic constitution ( infra ). Finally, like many other settlements in the region, Zeleia was eventually subdued by Kyzikos (no. 747 ) (Strabo 13 . 1 . 5 ; cf. 12 . 4 . 6 , 13 . 1 . 10 ) and, probably, turned into a fort ( φρουacuteριον ) in the Kyzikene territory (cf. Steph. Byz. 295 . 7 ). Almost all information about institutions, officials, cults and calendar stems from two inscriptions ( SGDI 5532 = Syll . ³ 279 = Michel 530 and SGDI 5533 = Michel 531 ) connected with the establishment of a democratic regime after 334 (cf. Lolling ( 1881 ), ( 1884 ) 58 -60 ). They attest a popular assembly called δηtilde µ ος ( 5532 . 1 , 5533 b-f), an επιστάτης ( 5532 . 1 , 5533 b-e), the 'officials' ( άρχοντες : 5532 . 22 , 33 , 38 ), δικασταί and σ [ υ ] νήγοροι ( 5532 . 27 , 30 -32 ; see also ψήφισ µ α : 11 , 26 , 34 ; γνώ µ η : 13 ). SGDI 5532 and 5533 f concern the regulation of the possession of public land (cf. δη µ όσια χωρία : 5532 passim ). The reference to land belonging to exiles testifies to a stasis in connection with the change of constitution ( ταgraveς γέας τῶ µ φυγάδων : 5533 f). The decrees SGDI 5533 a-c grant politeia , ateleia and proedria to foreigners; 5533 d grants politeia , land, ateleia and proedria to an inhabitant of Zeleia; while 5533 e grants land (as above), ateleia and proedria to a Zeleian citizen. Of the foreigners honoured, one is a proxenos of Zeleia in Eresos (no. 796 ) ( 5533 c) and one is from Thourioi (no. 74 ) ( 5533 b). SGDI 5532 mentions the acropolis of the city ( 6 -7 ), the sanctuary of Apollo Pythios ( 36 -37 ) as well as other public sanctuaries ( 38 ). Strabo 13 . 1 . 13 mentions that there had once been an oracle ( µ αντεῖον ) in Zeleia, probably to be connected with the cult of Apollo Pythios. A public oath invoking Artemis ( SGDI 5532 . 10 , 32 ) as well as coin types ( infra ) testify to a cult of Artemis. From SGDI 5532 . 17 , 23 -24 are known ## II. The Poleis"
765,Abydos (Abydenos),Troas,40.1,23.15,1038,4913,"765 . Abydos (Abydenos) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 10 , long. 23 . 15 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Αacuteβυδος , ηasper (Hdt. 9 . 114 . 2 ; Thuc. 8 . 62 . 3 ; I.Knidos 603 . 12 (C4f)); the cityethnic is Αβυδενός ( IG i³ 264 . iv . 10 ), or Αβυδηνός (Hdt. 7 . 44 ; I.Knidos 603 . 4 ; Head HN ² 538 -39 ). Abydos was founded in C7e from Miletos (Thuc. 8 . 61 . 1 ). It is called a polis in the urban sense by Hdt. 5 . 117 . 1 and Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 5 , and in the political sense by Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 36 . In Ps.-Skylax 94 Abydos is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε . By implication Abydos is called a polis in the territorial sense at Hdt. 7 . 43 . 2 , and is called an asty by Xenophon at Hell . 4 . 8 . 39 . The earliest collective external use of the city-ethnic is in the Athenian tribute lists between 454 / 3 and 429 / 8 ( infra ) and the earliest collective internal use is on C5f coins ( infra ). The external individual use is found in Hdt. 4 . 138 . 1 ; IG i³ 1340 ( 425 -400 ); IG ii² 49 (C4e). The name of territory was ηasper τῶν Αβυδηνῶν χώρα (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 6 ; cf. Hdt. 7 . 95 . 2 ) or ηasper Αβυδηνή (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 35 ). It included gold mines mentioned by Kallisthenes (( FGrHist 124 ) fr. 54 . 12 ); Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 37 implies that these were in the plain near Kremaste. Xerxes mustered his troops along πάσας ταgraveς άκτας καιgrave ταgrave τῶν Αβυδηνῶν πεδία (Hdt. 7 . 45 ). The territory extended to Dardanos on the south-west (Hdt. 7 . 43 . 2 ) and as far as Astyra, which by Strabo's day was incorporated (Strabo 13 . 1 . 23 ). Abydos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is registered from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 29 , restored) to 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 25 ) a total of eighteen times, twice completely restored,paying a phoros of sometimes 4 tal. ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 29 ), sometimes 6 tal. ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 17 ) and sometimes other amounts. It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 62 , restored). It defected from the Delian League in 411 (Thuc. 8 . 62 . 1 ), and Xenophon mentions the presence of a Spartan harmost at Abydos in Hell . 3 . 1 . 9 , 4 . 8 . 3 , 5 and 32 . In Hell . 2 . 1 . 8 he refers to foot-soldiers of Abydos, and in 4 . 8 . 33 to 200 hoplites, 50 of whom were later killed ( 4 . 8 . 39 ). Abydos was under the control of a pro-Persian tyrant, Daphnis, in the 520 s (Hdt. 4 . 138 . 1 ), and it was one of the Hellespontine cities destroyed by fire by Dareios after his Skythian expedition (Strabo 13 . 1 . 22 ). Five men of Abydos are recorded as proxenoi of Athens in IG ii² 49 (C4e); and Iphiades of Abydos was appointed proxenos by Knidos in C4f ( I.Knidos 603 ). Arist. Pol . 1305 b 33 classes the constitution of Abydos as an oligarchy, in which the magistrates were still chosen by the hoplites and the people.As such it was unstable and liable to upheaval: αλλ ' αιasper µ εgraveν αρχαιgrave εκ τι µ η µ άτων µ εγάλων εισιgraveν ηgrave εasperταιριῶν , αιasperρουtildeνται δεgrave οιasper οasperπλῖται καιgrave οasper δηtilde µ ος , οasperacuteπερ εν ΑβυacuteδΩsubiotaω συνέβαινεν . . . κινουtildeνται δ ' αιasper ολιγαρχίαι εξ αυτῶν καιgrave διαgrave φιλονεικίαν δη µ αγωγουacuteντων . This oligarchy may be dated to the period after Abydos' defection from Athens in 411 . C. 360 , after a period of stasis , the oligarchy was replaced by a new tyranny under Iphiades (Arist. Pol . 1306 a 26 -31 ; I.Knidos 603 ). The same stasis , or another period of stasis , is referred to at Arist. Oec . 1349 a 3 -8 : a stasiasmos led to the land being left uncultivated, and to resident foreigners ( µ έτοικοι ) refusing to make loans until they had been paid for existing debts. A decree was passed ( εψηφίσαντο ) allowing anyone who wished to provide loans to the farmers, who were to repay their creditors from the first yield of their harvests. There are few remains of the city. Arist. Mir. ausc . 832 b 17 mentions a theatre, and the accounts of sieges in C5l and C4 imply that it was fortified (Thuc. 8 . 62 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 4 , 5 . 1 . 7 ). Abydos struck coins from C6l to C3e. ( 1 ) Electrum coinage doubtfully attributed to Abydos, c. 500 : obv . eagle (on hare), dolphin; rev . incuse square.

The toponym is Αχιλλήιον , τό (Hdt. 5 . 94 . 2 ) or Αχίλλειον (MS Αιγιαλεῖον ) (Ps.-Skylax 95 ). The city-ethnics Αχιλλειώτης and Αχιλλείτης are recorded by Steph. Byz. 152 . 14 -15 , in general of places called Αχίλλειον . Achilleion is called a polis in the urban sense by Hdt. 5 . 94 . 2 , when it was used as a base by Mytilenians involved in conflict with the Athenians based in its northern neighbour, Sigeion. In Ps.-Skylax 95 Achilleion is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες . . . αιasperacuteδε . The name has been restored in the assessment lists of the Delian League in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 137 ) and 421 ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 23 ), where it is found in lists of Aktaiai poleis that use polis in the political sense. The city walls were reputedly built by the Mytilenians with stones from the ruins of Ilion (Strabo 13 . 1 . 39 ). The site at Be  sika Burnu was identified with Achilleion by Cook ( 1973 ) 186 -88 (accepted by Barr .); at Be  sika Burnu are remains of a fortification wall securely dated to C6f (Cook ( 1973 ) 186 -88 ; Korfmann ( 1988 ) 394 -95 ; Schulz ( 2000 ) 11 -12 ). Achilleion probably minted bronze coins c. 350 -300 ; for the attribution, see Imhoof-Blümer ( 1901 ) 33 -34 . However, L. Robert ( 1951 ) 8 -9 n. 2 pointed out that these coins might also be attributed to Achaiion.

767,Antandros (Antandrios),Troas,39.35,26.5,792,3712,"767 . Antandros (Antandrios) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 35 , long. 26 . 50 . Size of territory: 4 ? Type: A: β . The toponym is Αacuteντανδρος , ηasper (Thuc. 4 . 52 . 3 , 75 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 25 , IG i³ 77 . iv . 15 ), Αacuteντανδρος ηasper εν ΤρΩsubiotaωάδι γηsubiotaηtilde (Hdt. 5 . 26 ), Αacuteντανδρος ηasper Πελασγίς (Hdt. 7 . 42 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is Αντάνδριος (Thuc. 8 . 108 . 4 ; SEG 22 191 (C4s)). Alkaios calls it a polis in the political sense ( PLF Z 13 ), and it is listed, also in the political sense, as one of the Aktaiai poleis in IG i³ 77 . iv . 15 . At Thuc. 4 . 52 . 3 Antandros is called a polis twice, first in the urban, then in the political sense; and it is called a polis in the urban sense by Thuc. 8 . 108 . 4 . Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 26 has politeia . It is called πατρίς by Diod. 13 . 42 . 4 (r 411 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally by Thuc. 8 . 108 . 4 , Xen. Hell. 1 . 1 . 26 and an inscription of C2 (Michel 542 ), and internally by C5s coins ( infra ). The external individual use of the city-ethnic is found in SEG 22 191 (C4s). Its territory was called ηasper Αντανδρία by Arist. Hist. an . 519 a 16 and later sources. It included shipyards at Aspaneus and a sanctuary of Artemis at Astyra, which is called a polis in Ps.-Skylax 98 , a kome in Strabo 13 . 1 . 51 , and a polichne in Strabo 13 . 1 . 65 . It belonged to the Troad (Hdt. 5 . 26 ), and its tribal affiliation was Aiolic. Antandros was founded by Aiolians (Thuc. 8 . 108 . 4 ), although later sources alleged a link with Andros, on a spurious etymological basis (Pomponius Mela 1 . 18 ; Servius on Verg. Aen . 3 . 6 ). There are also references to the indigenous population. Hdt. 7 . 42 . 1 calls it Αacuteντανδρος ηasper Πελασγίς ; Alkaios (D. L. Page, Lyrica Graeca Selecta fr. 156 apud Strabo 13 . 1 . 51 ) refers to a community of Leleges; and Demetrios of Skepsis apud Strabo 13 . 1 . 51 to a community of Kilikes. It is also said to have been previously occupied by Thrakian Edonoi and Kimmerioi (Arist. fr. 483 . 1 ). The city was captured by Otanes, the Persian satrap of the Hellespontine area, c. 512 (Hdt. 5 . 26 ). It became a member of the Delian League after the Mytilene Revolt from 427 , but was betrayed to Mytilenian refugees, who occupied the city before it was recovered in summer 425 (Thuc. 4 . 52 . 3 , 75 . 1 -2 ). The toponym is recorded among the Aktaiai poleis in the tribute lists of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 125 , restored) and 421 ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 15 ), and Antandros was reckoned to be one of the Ακταῖαι πόλεις (Thuc. 4 . 52 . 3 ). In 411 / 10 it ejected a Persian garrison (Thuc. 8 . 108 . 4 -5 ). There is evidence for sympoliteia with the Syracusans, who were given politeia by the Antandrians in thanks for benefits received in 409 (Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 26 ). It was on the route of the Delphic theorodokoi around 200 (Plassart ( 1921 ) 8 ; Cook ( 1988 ) 12 ). In C2 Antandros sent foreign judges to Peltai in Phrygia (Michel 668 ). The acropolis is mentioned by Thuc. 8 . 108 . 5 , and the walls were repaired with Syracusan help in 409 (Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 26 ). Cults of Antandros include Apollo, who appears as a contributor in a list of stephanephoroi of C1 (Michel 668 ), and Artemis Astyrene, who appears on the coinage. Antandros struck coins of silver and bronze, c. 440 -400 and c. 400 -284 . Denominations: triobol, trihemiobol, tritemorion.( 1 ) Silver, 440 -400 : obv .

768,Arisbe (Arisbaios),Troas,,,318,1394,"768 . Arisbe (Arisbaios) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 10 , long 26 . 30 , but the exact site has not been localised.Type: B: α . The toponym is Αρίσβη , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 836 , 6 . 13 , 21 . 43 ); Diod. 14 . 38 . 3 has Αρίσβα . The city-ethnic is Αρισβαῖος ( IG i³ 271 . i . 23 ). Arisbe is called a polis in the urban sense by Diod. 14 . 38 . 3 (r 399 ). Plin. HN 5 . 125 calls Arisbe an oppidum , which was still inhabited in his day. By 216 it was part of the territory of Abydos (Polyb. 5 . 111 . 5 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 38 ). The founder of Arisbe was Miletos (Strabo 14 . 1 . 6 ). Steph. Byz. 119 . 9 reports a foundation story from Ephor. fr. 164 that Arisbe was a Mytilenian foundation, but this seems to be a false inference from the existence of the homonymous Arisba on Lesbos (Strabo 13 . 1 . 21 ; Hdt. 1 . 151 . 2 ). It is not mentioned by Herodotos, Thucydides or Xenophon, although their narratives concern the cities of this region (see Tenger ( 1994 ) 147 ). Arisbe was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is registered from 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . iv . 16 , restored) to 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 38 ) a total of five times, paying a phoros of 2 tal. ( IG i³ 271 . i . 23 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 63 , restored)."
769,Assos (Assios),Troas,39.3,26.2,893,4496,"769 . Assos (Assios) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 30 ; long. 26 . 20 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: B: α . The toponym is Ασσός , ηasper (Xen. Ages . 2 . 26 ; Ephor. fr. 47 ). The following forms of the city-ethnic are attested: Αacuteσσιος (C5 coins, infra ; OGIS 221 . 2 ( 274 )), Αacuteσσοος (C5 coins), Ασσευacuteς (Steph.Byz. 137 . 2 ), /acuteΕσσιος ( IG i³ 284 . 20 ), h έσσιος ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 16 ), /asperacuteΗσσιος (Krateros fr. 23 , Krech). Assos is not called a polis by Archaic or Classical sources, but Steph. Byz. 136 . 7 retrospectively (and erroneously) calls it a πόλις Λυδίας . This passage, which does not identify his source, refers to Assos as a polis in an urban sense, and in a political sense as the second city of Aiolis. That Assos was a polis at least in the Classical period is indicated by its membership of the Delian League and its coinage ( infra ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally by the tribute lists of the Delian League ( infra ) and internally by C5s coins ( infra ). Individually, the external city-ethnic is attested in OGIS 221 ( 274 ), and it is used for the Stoic Kleanthes (born 331 ) in, e.g., Plut. De exil . 599 A and Diog. Laert. 7 . 168 . The territory of Assos may have included the poleis of Gargara and Lamponeion (Leaf ( 1923 ) 253 -57 ), the former having been founded by Assians (Strabo 13 . 1 . 58 ). According to Hellan. fr. 160 , Assos was founded from Lesbos by Aiolians, and according to Myrsilos (( FGrHist 477 ) fr. 17 ) by Methymna (both apud Strabo 13 . 1 . 58 ); Alexander Polyhistor. fr. 137 ( FGrHist 118 , fr. 96 ), in a commentary on Alkman, referred to Assos as an άποικος Μιτυληναίων (Steph. Byz. 136 . 12 ). It retained the character of an Aiolic city, as is shown by the survival of the cult in imperial times of Zeus Homoloios, which is common in Boiotia ( IGR iv 256 ; see RE viii. 2263 -64 and xa. 244 ).A prior Lelegian population is referred to in Hom. Il . 10 . 429 , noted by Strabo 13 . 1 . 58 . Assos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is registered from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 9 ) to 427 / 6 or 426 / 5 ( IG i³ 284 . 20 ) a total of eight times,twice completely restored,paying a phoros of 1 tal. ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 9 ). It was presumably assessed for tribute in 410 / 9 (Krateros fr. 23 , Krech = IG i³ 100 ). Assos was ruled by the tyrants Euboulos, c. 360 , and his eunuch/slave Hermias, who died in 344 and was based at Atarneus in Aiolis (Strabo 13 . 1 . 57 ; see Leaf ( 1923 ) 295 -97 ). In C4m the tyrant /asperacuteΕρ µ ιας with his associates was an equal partner in a treaty with Erythrai ( I.Erythrai 9 ). Hermias was resident at Assos from 348 to 345 (see the sources in Leaf ( 1923 ) 299 ). The Archaic city temple on the acropolis, rebuilt in C4 , was probably dedicated to Athena Polias; see coin types and I.Assos 14 . iii : ηasper τηtildeς Πολιάδος Αθηναtildeς ιasperέρεια (first century ad ). It was Doric, with six by thirteen columns, pronaos in antis, and an enclosed cella. The architraves and metopes were decorated with scenes from the Herakles cycle (Westcoat ( 1987 ); Stüpperich ( 1996 )). Fortifications built from polygonal masonry of the Archaic(?) period were succeeded by well-preserved ashlar walls of C4 (?); Lang ( 1996 ) 223 ; Schulz ( 2000 ) 16 . These contained two main gateways with square towers, seven smaller gates,one round and numerous square towers,and enclosed an area of a little more than 55 ha ( PECS ). The acropolis was separately fortified. The city was besieged by the Persian satraps Autophradates and Maussolos in 365 (Xen. Ages . 2 . 26 ). A cemetery with burials dating between C6 and C4 has been excavated on either side of a paved street outside the west gate (Stüpperich ( 1994 )). Domestic housing of C6 -C5 is also recorded. Other public buildings, including an agora with stoas, a bouleuterion , a theatre (destroyed in the nineteenth century),as well as fountain houses and drainage systems date mostly to the Heltic period ( PECS ). Three periods can be distinguished when Assos minted coins. ( 1 ) Silver, c. 479 -450 : obv . griffin; rev . lion's head.

770,Astyra (Astyrenos),Troas,39.35,26.55,454,2107,"770 . Astyra (Astyrenos) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 35 , long. 26 . 55 . Size of teritory: 1 ? Type: [A]: α . The toponym is Αacuteστυρα Μυacuteσια , τά ( IG i³ 273 . i . 25 -26 ; Ps.-Skylax 98 ). The city-ethnic is Αστυρηνοιgrave Μυacuteσοι ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 9 ). Ps.-Skylax assigns it to Lydia,while the tribute lists of the Delian League and Strabo make it part of Mysia ( 13 . 1 . 65 ). It was probably situated at Kilisetepe Kaplıcaları. In Ps.-Skylax 98 Astyra is the first toponym listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες . . . αιasperacuteδε . Strabo describes it as a κώ µ η ( 13 . 1 . 51 ; cf. Steph. Byz. 140 . 16 ) but formerly a πολίχνη dependent on Antandros ( 13 . 1 . 65 ). The 'city-ethnic'is applied to Artemis by Xen. Hell . 4 . 1 . 41 , and collectively and externally it is used in the Athenian tribute lists. Astyra was a member of the Delian League, usually recorded by city/city-ethnic but once by toponym ( IG i³ 273 . i . 25 -26 ). It belonged to the Ionian district and is registered from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 6 ) to 438 / 7 ( IG i³ 274 . iii . 3 ) a total of eight times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 500 dr. ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 9 ). The community housed the sanctuary of Artemis Astyrene (Xen. Hell . 4 . 1 . 41 ; Ps.-Skylax 98 ), which was also reckoned to belong to Antandros. Astyra struck coins of silver and bronze in C5 -C4 . (A) Bronze, c. 400 -395 : obv . bearded head of Tissaphernes; legend: ΤΙΣΣΑ ; rev . facing cult image of Artemis Astyrene; legend: ΑΣΤΥΡΗ .

The toponym is Αacuteστυρα Τροϊκά , τά ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 86 ; Strabo 13 . 1 . 23 ). Strabo describes this Astyra as a πόλις κατεσκα µµ ένη , situated in Troas and now belonging to Abydos, but in earlier times independent and in possession of gold mines, now exhausted. The date of its destruction is unknown. It was claimed to be a member of the Delian League; attested by the name [ Αacuteστ ] υρα Τρο [ ϊ ] κά in the assessment of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 86 ). See Leaf ( 1923 ) 133 ; ATL i. 472 ; Stäuber ( 1996 )."
772,Azeia (Azeieus),Troas,,,313,1512,"772 . Azeia (Azeieus) Unlocated. Not in Barr . Type: C: β ? The toponym may have been Αacuteζεια (suggested by Steph. Byz. 32 . 4 ). The ethnic is Αζειευacuteς ( Αζει ˜ ες , IG i³ 279 . i . 106 ) or Αζειός ( Αζειοί , IG i³ 261 . iv . 28 ) or Αζειώτης (Hellan. fr. 58 ). The Azeians were members of the Delian League. They belonged to the Hellespontine district ( IG i³ 270 . ii . 26 ) and are recorded from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 28 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . iii . 3 , ethnic heavily restored) a total of seven times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 400 dr. ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 28 ). They were perhaps assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 67 : [ Αζε ] ι [ ˜ ες ]). Since the Azeians are recorded in the tribute lists by ethnic only and never by toponym, and since we have no other source,we do not know whether they were settled in a polis town or were a people living dispersed or settled in small villages.Being recorded in the tribute lists, the Azeians must have been a political community, and possibly a polis , but we have no proof. In the Athenian tribute lists the Αζειείς belong to the Hellespontine district, whereas the Αζειῶται are classified by Steph. Byz-quoting Hellanikos-as an έθνος τηtildeς Τρωάδος . If the Azeians were the same as the Azeiotans, they must have lived in northern Asia Minor, and presumably in Troas. In ATL i. 463 -64 the Azeians are connected with Azeus, grandfather of the Minyan leaders at Troy (Hom. Il . 2 . 513 ) and placed in the Troad."
773,Birytis (Berysios),Troas,39.55,26.2,382,1797,"773 . Birytis (Berysios) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 55 , long. 26 . 20 , but this location, at Mersinoba (Cook ( 1973 ) 114 , 357 ), is not beyond doubt. Type: B:? The toponym is Βέρυτις , Τρωικηgrave πόλις (Steph. Byz. 165 . 8 ) or Βήριθος , πόλις Τρωική (Steph. Byz. 167 . 6 ). The city-ethnic Βερυacute [ σιοι ] υποgrave τ ˜ ε [ ι /acuteΙδ ] ει is recorded in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 261 . iii . 2 ), but C4l coins ( infra ) have the form ΒΙΡΥ ; Steph. Byz. 165 . 8 records the city-ethnic Βερυτίτης , but there is no other authority for this. NoArchaic or Classical source calls Berytis a polis , and the retrospective mentions in Steph. Byz. do not indicate a source. However, the community issued its own coinage in C4l ( infra ). The external collective city-ethnic is recorded in the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ), and the internal by coins of C4 /C3 ( infra ). Birytis was a member of the Delian League.It presumably belonged to the Hellespontine district ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 91 , restored) and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 11 -12 ) to 446 / 5 ( IG i³ 266 . i . 25 ) a total of six times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 11 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 91 , restored). However,it is not completely certain that the Berysioi are to be identified as the inhabitants of the polis mentioned by Steph. Byz. 165 . 8 -9 ; see ATL i. 246 -47 , 475 .

774,Dardanos (Dardaneus),Troas,40.05,26.25,710,3380,"774 . Dardanos (Dardaneus) Map 51 . Lat. 40 . 05 , long. 26 . 25 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is ∆άρδανος , ηasper (Hdt. 5 . 117 . 1 ; Thuc. 8 . 104 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is ∆αρδανευacuteς ( IG i³ 267 . i . 24 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 10 , An . 3 . 1 . 47 ); ∆αρδανίς is found at Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 10 ; Steph. Byz. 219 . 3 has ∆αρδανίδης . The ktetic form ∆αρδανική is applied to the territory (Strabo 13 . 1 . 44 ). Dardanos is called a polis in the urban sense by Herodotos 5 . 117 . 1 and 7 . 43 . 2 , where the territorial sense is a connotation. In Ps.-Skylax 95 Dardanos is the first toponym listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες . . . αιasperacuteδε . It is called polis in the political sense by Xen. An . 5 . 6 . 21 and 23 and an early Heltic inscription (Tas ¸ lıklıo˘ glu ( 1971 ) 187 no. 2 ). Furthermore, polis is used retrospectively by Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom . 1 . 46 . 1 , who draws his information from Hellan. fr. 31 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally by IG i³ 267 . i . 24 and 268 . ii . 31 , and internally in the genitive plural on coins of the Roman period ( SNG Cop. Troas 307 -11 ), in abbreviated forms on coins of the Classical period ( infra ). The external individual use of the city-ethnic is attested in Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 10 and An . 5 . 6 . 21 . The city territory is referred to in Mnaseas (( FHG iii ) 154 fr. 28 = Steph. Byz. 219 . 1 -2 ) as ηasper ∆αρδανία , ηasper Τευκριgraveς πρότερον εκαλεῖτο . For the few archaeological remains of the settlement (mostly sherds), see Cook ( 1973 ) 57 -60 . Referring to an uncertain period between C4 and C1 , Strabo described Dardanos as an ancient foundation,whose inhabitants were often transferred to Abydos by Heltic kings, but then returned to the ancient foundation, κτίσ µ α αρχαῖον , ουasperacuteτω δ ' ευκαταφρόνητος , ωasperacuteστε πολλάκις οιasper βασιλεῖς οιasper µ εgraveν µ ετΩsubiotaώκιζον αυτηgraveν εις Αacuteβυδον , οιasper δεgrave ανΩsubiotaώκιζον πάλιν εις τοgrave αρχαῖον κτίσ µ α (Strabo 13 . 1 . 28 ). This passage may imply that it was an early, perhaps C7 Greek colonial settlement, but the colonists are unknown. Dardanos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded from 451 / 50 ( IG i³ 262 . iv . 10 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 B. i . 3 ) a total of fifteen times, twice completely restored, paying mostly a phoros of 1 tal. ( IG i³ 270 . ii . 3 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 72 , restored). It may have been controlled by the satrap of Aiolis, Ζηtildeνις ∆αρδανευacuteς , in 399 (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 10 ). An early Heltic city decree ( psephisma ) mentions a boule (Tas ¸lıklıo˘ glu ( 1971 ) 187 no. 2 ). IG ii² 78 (before 378 ) is possibly a honorary decree for citizens of Dardanos (l. 8 : ∆α [ ρδαν ˜ ες ]). Dardanos struck coins of electrum, silver and bronze from C6 /C5 to C4 . Almost all the coin types show fighting cocks. ( 1 ) (?)Electrum stater, minted in Lydia, of C6 /C5 : obv . cock; rev . quadripartite incuse square. ( 2 ) Silver issues on the Persian standard, C5l: obv . horseman; rev . cock(s); legend: ∆ΑΡ ΖΗ (a possible reference to Ζηtildeνις ∆αρδανευacuteς , satrap of Aiolis in 399 , Xen.

775,Gargara (Gargareus),Troas,39.35,26.3,824,3841,"775 . Gargara (Gargareus) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 35 , long. 26 . 30 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A: β . The toponym is Γάργαρος , ηasper (Hom. Il . 8 . 48 , 15 . 151 ; Alkman apud Steph. Byz. 198 . 22 ), or Γάργαρα , τά (Ephor. fr. 47 ; Strabo 13 . 1 . 5 ); according to Steph. Byz. 199 , Hellan. fr. 158 used the form Γάργασος , but Stephanos states: οίο µ αι δεgrave σφάλ µ α εῖναι . The presumed forerunner of the coastal site is called Παλαιαgrave Γάργαρος ( Etym. Magn . 221 . 30 ), or Παλαιγάργαρος (Steph. Byz. 128 . 21 ). The city-ethnic is Γαργαρευacuteς ( IG i³ 270 . i . 34 ; Michel 522 . 22 ). Gargara is called a polis in the urban sense by Ephor. fr. 47 and is implied to be a polis in the political sense in the inscription for Malousios of Gargara of 306 ( I.Ilion 1 . 4 -5 , 17 , 22 , etc.). The collective city-ethnic is attested internally on C5s coins ( infra ) and externally on C5 and C4 inscriptions ( IG i³ 270 . i . 34 ; Michel 522 . 22 ). The external individual use of the city-ethnic is found in a Chian C4list of proxenoi ( PEP Chios 50 . 12 ) and in the inscription of Ilion for Malousios (Michel 522 . 3 , etc.). The name became the butt of jokes in the later C5 . Alkaios comicus fr. 19 , Kock, refers to γάργαρ ' ανθρώπων , and Ar. Ach . 3 to ψα µµ ακοσιογάργαρα (Leaf ( 1923 ) 263 ). The city territory was known as ηasper Γαργαρίς (Strabo 13 . 1 . 58 ) and was proverbial for its fertility (Verg. G . 1 . 103 ; Sen. Phoen . 608 ; Macrob. Sat . v . 20 . 15 -16 ; cf. Tenger ( 1994 ) 150 n. 91 ). Gargara was a πόλις Αιολική (Strabo 13 . 1 . 5 ; cf. Steph. Byz. 128 . 22 , who also cites Hecat. fr. 224 ), founded from Assos (Strabo 13 . 1 . 58 ), although the indigenous population was Lelegian (Strabo 13 . 1 . 58 , interpreting Hom. Il . 10 . 428 ). Gargara was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . v . 22 ) to 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 22 ) a total of eight times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of either 4 , 500 dr. ( IG i³ 261 . v . 22 ) or 4 , 660 dr. ( IG i³ 270 . i . 34 ). It was assessed for tribute in 410 / 9 ( IG i³ 100 . ii . 6 ). In C4l it was a member of the confederation of Athena Ilias (Michel 522 ). The site was relocated from Palaigargara on a mountain peak to a coastal site at an unspecified period, either before C5 (so ATL i. 477 ) or in the Heltic period later than the composition of the epigram of Aratos ( Anth. Pal . 9 . 437 ; so Leaf ( 1923 ) 262 ). Demetrios of Skepsis apud Strabo 13 . 1 . 58 reports that colonists were brought from Miletoupolis by the kings, so that the population became semi-barbarous rather than Aiolic. This was presumably in the Heltic period. The mountain-top site was defended by fortification walls of the Archaic period (Stüpperich ( 1995 ); cf. Schulz ( 2000 ) 28 ), and included a walled acropolis area with foundations of a temple.Hom. Il . 8 . 48 reports a cult of Zeus at the summit.Architectural remains include an Aiolic capital and a mid-C6 relief of an armed warrior, which may have served as a column (Stüpperich ( 1995 ), correcting and adding to Cook ( 1973 ) 255 -61 ). It was on the route of the Delphic theorodokoi c. 200 (Plassart ( 1921 ) 8 ; Cook ( 1988 ) 15 ). A citizen of Gargara is listed in a C4list of proxenoi from Chios ( RPh ( 1937 ) 325 -32 no. 6 A. 12 ). Gargara minted silver and bronze coins. ( 1 ) Silver, c. 420 -400 : denominations: tetrobol, diobol, hemiobol, tritartemorion: obv . male head (Apollo?); rev . bull grazing, or galloping horse, or ram's head, or spokes of wheel. ( 2 ) Silver and bronze, c. 400 -284 : denominations: tetrobol and small fractions: obv . Apollo laureate; rev . same types as ( 1 ), no wheel. Legend: ΓΑΡΓ or ΓΑΡ expanded to ΓΑΡΓΑΡΕΩΝ on imperial coins (Head, HN ² 545 ; SNG Cop. Troas 314 -31 )."

The toponym is Γεντῖνος (Steph.Byz. 203 . 3 ); the city-ethnic is Γεντίνιος ( IG i³ 261 . i . 8 ; Steph. Byz. 203 . 4 ). Gentinos is called a polis only by Steph. Byz. 203 . 3 , who cites no earlier source. Steph. Byz. 203 . 3 also reports that it was founded by one of the sons of Aineias.However,the collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally by C4 coins ( infra ) and externally by the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ). The city presumably controlled a small territory in the Skamandros basin between Ilion and Skamandra. Gentinos was a member of the Delian League.It is recorded from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . i . 8 ) to 444 / 3 ( IG i³ 268 . i . 31 ) a total of seven times, paying a phoros of 500 dr. ( IG i³ 261 . i . 8 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 64 , restored in the Hellespontine district; cf. Tenger ( 1994 ) 155 -56 ). The acropolis of the site on Ballı Da˘ g measures 190 × 100 m and has fortifications of rough masonry combined with more even work,including an arched entrance datable to C4 (Cook ( 1973 ) 134 -40 ). An agora with stone seats and a small Archaic/Classical temple are reported, but occupation did not spread beyond the hill-top, and the site was small. Gentinos minted bronze coins in C4 : obv . female head (Artemis, nymph?); rev . bee; legend: ΓΕΝ or ΓΕΝΤΙ (Head, HN ² 545 ; SNG Cop.Troas 335 -36 )."
777,Gergis (Gergithios),Troas,39.55,26.35,594,2821,"777 . Gergis (Gergithios) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 55 ; long. 26 . 35 . Size of territory: 4 ? Type: A: γ . The toponym is Γέργις , ηasper (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 15 ; Steph. Byz. 203 . 21 ) or Γέργιθος , ηasper (Steph. Byz. 203 . 21 -22 ) or Γεργιθία (Welles ( 1934 ) no. 10 ( 275 )); Strabo 13 . 1 . 19 reports the toponym in the plural feminine form αιasper Γέργιθες . Various forms of the city-ethnic are recorded: ηasper τῶν Γεργιθίων πόλις (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 22 ); Γέργιθες Τευκροί (Hdt. 5 . 122 . 2 , 7 . 43 . 2 ); Γεργιθιευacuteς ( IG iv . 1² 13 . 27 ( c. 270 )). Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 15 , 21 describes it as a polis in the urban sense; at 3 . 1 . 22 the political sense is probably a connotation. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally by Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 22 and internally by C4 coins ( infra ). The individual use of the ethnic is recorded c. 270 on an inscription of the Aitolians ( IG ix . 1² 13 . 27 ). The name of the territory was τοgrave Γεργίθιον , ηasper Γεργιθία ( sc . χώρα ; Welles ( 1934 ) no. 10 ( 275 ): αποgrave τηtildeς οasper µ ορουacuteσης τηtildeι Γεργιθίαι ηgrave τηsubiotaηtilde Σκηψίαι ). It was the inland region to the east of the route followed by Xerxes to Abydos in 481 (Hdt. 7 . 43 . 2 ), and included Marpessos, home of the sibyl Herophile, whose image is shown on coins of Gergis (Paus. 10 . 12 . 4 ; Head, HN ² 543 ). The Gergithes, described by Hdt. 5 . 122 . 2 as οιasper υasperπολειφθέντες τῶν αρχαίων Τευκρῶν , were an indigenous non-Greek people occupying the interior of the Troad north of the river Skamandros; see Leaf ( 1923 ) 102 -6 . This passage and Hdt. 7 . 43 . 2 indicate that Gergis was effectively a barbarian polis , in contrast to its neighbours on the coast of the Troad. The polis was controlled by the proPersian 'satrap' Zenis of Dardanos (or 'the Dardanian') and then by his widow, Mania, in 399 , and eventually by her son-in-law, Meidias of Skepsis (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 15 -22 ; see Winter ( 1994 )). Some of its inhabitants were transplanted by metoecism to a new settlement called Gergitha near the springs of the river Kaikos by Attalos I (Strabo 13 . 1 . 70 ). After 188 its territory was attached by synoecism to Ilion (Livy 38 . 39 ). One of its citizens, Νικόστρατος Αριστάρχου Γεργιθιευacuteς , was honoured in an Aitolian proxeny decree of c. 270 ( IG ix . 1² 13 . 27 ). Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 15 -22 implies that it was a fortified site, and specifically mentions gates and towers at 3 . 1 . 22 . Gergis struck coins of silver and bronze c. 400 -350 and c. 350 -241 : obv . head of sibyl Herophile; rev . seated sphinx; legend: ΓΕΡ . The coin type with sibyl and sphinx was mentioned by Phlegon of Tralles, cited in Steph. Byz. 204 . 1 -2 . (Head, HN ² 545 -46 ; SNG Cop.Troas 337 -40 ; Sear ( 1979 ) no. 4097 , silver hemiobol)."
778,Hamaxitos (Hamaxiteus),Troas,39.05,26.05,617,2785,"778 . Hamaxitos (Hamaxiteus) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 05 , long. 26 . 05 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is h[ α µ αχ ] σιτός ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 18 ) or Αasper µ αξιτός , ηasper (Thuc. 8 . 101 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 13 , 16 ; BCH 45 ( 1921 ) 8 ; Strabo 13 . 1 . 47 ). The city-ethnic is Αasper µ αξιτευacuteς ( Iscr. Cos 6 e ED 71 3 . 8 . 6 (C4l); Strabo 13 . 1 . 51 ; Steph. Byz. 83 . 11 , without citing an authority), or Αasper µ αξιτηνός (Apollodoros, FGrHist 244 , fr. 10 apud Steph. Byz.). It is called a polis in the political and urban senses combined by Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 13 , 16 (cf. Hansen ( 2000 ) 175 ). In Ps.Skylax 95 Hamaxitos is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες . . . αιasperacuteδε . The political sense is attested in a restored inscription from Kos dating between 321 and 306 ( Iscr. Cos 63 ED 71 g.B. 6 ), and its name has been restored ([ Α µ αχσ ] ιτός ) at IG i³ 77 . iv . 18 in a list of Aktaiai poleis which uses polis in the political sense. The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is attested on C4 coins ( infra ); the external collective use in Iscr. Cos 63 ED 71 g.B. 6 . The name of the territory was ηasper Αasper µ αξιτία (Strabo 10 . 3 . 21 ). It contained the temple of Apollo Smintheus at Gülpınar and two other places called Sminthia, also the salt pans at Tragasai (Strabo 13 . 1 . 48 ). However, the salt pans are said by Ath. 2 . 43 A to be on the territory of Larisa. Hamaxitos was one of the Ακταῖαι πόλεις in the Delian League and was assessed for tribute of 4 tal. in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 124 , 129 , toponym restored) and for an unknown amount in 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 14 , 18 ). Schwertheim ( 1988 ) ( SEG 38 1251 ) published an inscribed fragment purporting to be part of a treaty between Athens and Hamaxitos. Lewis ( 1993 ) ( SEG 43 877 ) suggested that this was part of an Athenian imperial decree, and questioned the restoration which assigned the text to Hamaxitos. On Kos has been found a C4l decree of Hamaxitos, granting proxenia and politeia to a citizen of Kos ( Iscr. Cos 63 ED 71 g.B. 6 .; cf. LGPN i , Nikomedes no. 12 ). Kos was on the route of the Delphic theorodokoi c. 200 ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) 8 ; Cook ( 1988 ) 15 ). Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 13 ( Αasper µ αξιτόν . . . τοῖς τείχεσιν ) suggests that the city possessed a circuit wall in C4e. Hamaxitos was absorbed into the newly founded city of Alexandreia in 310 (Strabo 13 . 1 . 47 ), and thereafter its territory was part of the chora of Alexandreia Troas (Strabo 10 . 3 . 21 ). It participated in the cult of Apollo Smintheus (Strabo 13 . 1 . 48 ). Hamaxitos struck bronze coins c. 400 -310 : obv . head of Apollo; rev . lyre, or Apollo Smintheus; legend: ΑΜΑΞΙ (Head, HN ² 546 ; SNG Cop.Troas 341 -45 )."
779,Ilion (Ilieus),Troas,39.55,26.15,1051,4981,"779 . Ilion (Ilieus) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 55 , long. 26 . 15 . Size of territory: 3 or 4 . Type: A: α . The toponym is /acuteΙλιον , τό (Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 5 ; Aen. Tact. 24 . 11 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ιλιευacuteς (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 16 ; T od 148 ( 359 ) = Michel 523 = I.Ilion 23 ) or ' Ιλιάς ( Αθηναίηsubiotaη τηsubiotaηtilde ' Ιλιάδι , Hdt. 7 . 40 ). According to Hdt. 7 . 40 , at Ilion Athena had the epiklesis ' Ιλιάς , which same form is also used to denote Ilian territory at Hdt. 5 . 94 . 2 and 7 . 42 . Ilion is called a polis in the urban sense by Aen. Tact. 24 . 12 , 14 (cf. Aen. Tact. 24 . 8 where it is called πόλισ µ α ). In Ps.Skylax 95 Ilion is the third toponym listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες . . . αιasperacuteδε . Ilion is called a polis in the urban and political senses combined by Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 16 and in an early Heltic inscription ( I.Ilion 25 ; cf. also Hellan. fr. 25 b). Its name has been restored ( ' Ι [ λιον ]) at IG i³ 71 . iii . 132 in a list of Aktaiai poleis which uses polis in the political sense. Strabo 13 . 1 . 27 , referring to the period before 189 , calls it a κω µ όπολις . The collective use of the ethnic is attested internally by a decree of Ilion of 359 (Tod 148 = I.Ilion 23 ) and by C4l coins (Head, HN ² 546 ), and externally by Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 16 . The external individual use of the ethnic is found in IG ii² 505 . 8 ( 302 / 1 ). Strabo refers to a period when Ilion was a kome : τηgraveν δεgrave τῶν / Ιλιέων πόλιν τῶν νυtildeν τέως µ εgraveν κώ µ ην εῖναί φασιν , τοgrave ιasperεροgraveν έχουσαν τηtildeς Αθηναtildeς µ ικροgraveν καιgrave ευτελές (Strabo 13 . 1 . 16 ). The name of the territory was ηasper ' Ιλιαgraveς γηtilde (Hdt. 7 . 42 ), ηasper ' Ιλιαgraveς χώρα (Hdt. 5 . 94 . 2 ), or simply ηasper ' Ιλιάς (Hdt. 5 . 122 . 2 ). Ilion was one of the Aiolic settlements of the Troas (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 16 ). If the toponym is correctly restored in IG i³ 71 and 77 , it was one of the Ακταῖαι πόλεις in the Delian League and was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 124 , 132 , /acuteΙ [ λιον ], 2 tal.) and in 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 14 21 , amount not preserved, toponym completely restored). Ilion awarded proxenia to Menelaos, son of Arrhibaios of Athens, in C4 (Tod 148 = I.Ilion 23 ). A kind of sympoliteia with Lampsakos (no. 748 ) is probably attested by an unique silver tridrachm : obv . head of Athena with Corinthian helmet, r.; rev . winged horse, r., under the horse: ΛΑΜ ( ΨΑΚΗΝΩΝ ), above it: ΙΛ ( ΙΕΩΝ ) (Frisch ( 1975 ) XV, ( 1978 ) 129 -30 ( c. 300 )). In the early Heltic period it was democratic, as is shown by a lengthy law which was devised against tyrants and oligarchies (Michel 524 = I.Ilion 25 ). This text also implies that the chief magistrate was a strategos , an office that could only be held once; there was also a tamias , and the magistracies were collectively known as archai . A citizenship decree of c. 300 testifies to the organisation of the citizens into phylai ( I.Ilion 24 . 13 ). The city buildings included a prytaneion ( I.Ilion 24 . 20 , 25 . 25 ) and a dikasterion ( I.Ilion 25 . 78 , perhaps a lawcourt rather than a court room). Aen.Tact. 24 . 4 -13 refers repeatedly to πυacuteλαι , thus indicating that the city was fortified in C4f (cf. Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 16 ), but there are virtually no monumental traces of the pre-Heltic city, although the remains suggest that the settlement was more prosperous in C7 -C6 than in C5 -C4 ( PECS ). Recent excavations show almost continuous occupation of the site after the fall of Troy VII. 2 in the late Bronze Age. Archaic finds include bronze fibulae of c. 700 and an Aiolic capital (Mitchell ( 1999 ) 138 ). Recent excavations have revealed a sanctuary of C8 -C6 , but no further building in the Classical period (Rose ( 2000 ) 284 ). The city wall, attributed by Strabo 13 . 1 . 26 to Lysimachos, in fact appears to have been built c. 275 -250 (Rose ( 1997 ) 93 -101 ). Ilion was refounded at the end of C4 , probably by Lysimachos (Strabo 13 . 1 . 26 , the interpretation of this passage is very controversial; see Leaf ( 1923 ) 142 -43 , who attributes the embellishment to Alexandreia; but see L. Robert ( 1951 ) 7 -8 ). A prytaneion is mentioned in the pro-democratic law against tyrants and oligarchies, probably of C3e (Michel 524 A. 25 -26 = I.Ilion 25 ), and Michel 522 . 11 ( c. 306 ) refers to a theatre. The most important cult was that of Athena Ilias (Hdt. 7 . 43 . 1 -2 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 5 ). The most recent study of the sculpted reliefs from the temple argues that it was not early Heltic, but constructed in C2 -C1 (Schmidt-Dounas ( 1991 )). Ilion issued a little silver and bronze coinage between C4l and c. 240 : obv . Athena; rev . sometimes vase, mostly Athena Ilias wearing kalathos and chiton with symbol (thunderbolt, owl); legend: ΙΛΙ (Head, HN ² 546 ; SNG Cop. Troas 346 -61 ). For an issue struck in collaboration with Lampsakos (no. 748 ) see supra ."

Hell . 3 . 1 . 17 ; Dem. 23 . 154 ; I.Assos 4 (C2 )) or Κεβρήνη (Strabo 13 . 1 . 47 ) or Κεβρηνία (Diod. 14 . 38 . 3 (r 399 )). The city-ethnic is Κεβρένιος ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 33 ), Κεβρήνιος (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 18 ) or ΚΕΒΡΕΝΕ , probably for Κεβρενευacuteς (C6 coins, infra ). The forms Κεβρήνιος , Κεβρηνός and Κεβρηνευacuteς are all found in Strabo ( 13 . 1 . 51 , 33 ). In Ps.-Skylax 96 Kebren is the first toponym listed after the heading Αιολίδες δεgrave πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε and it is called a polis in the urban sense by Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 17 , but a polisma by Strabo 13 . 1 . 47 , referring to the period after it was incorporated into Alexandreia.The collective use of the ethnic is attested internally on C6 coins (Head, HN ² 543 ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ) and Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 18 . The external individual use of the ethnic is attested on a C5 inscription from Gergis (Cook ( 1973 ) 401 no. 18 ). The name of the territory was Κεβρηνία (Strabo 13 . 1 . 33 ). Strabo observes that Kebrenia was parallel to and south of ancient Dardania, and that it was divided from the territory of Skepsis by the river Skamandros. It was regarded by Ephor. fr. 22 , as προgraveς τηsubiotaηtilde /acute Ιδηsubiotaη . Steph. Byz. 371 . 3 calls Κεβρηνία a χώρα τηtildeς ΤρΩsubiotaωάδος . The city was founded from Kyme in Aiolis (Ephor. fr. 10 ; Homeri vita Herodotea c. 20 , Allen). Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 18 implies that the /asperacuteΕλληνες in the city were to be distinguished from a non-Greek element. Kebren was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 26 ) to 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 9 ) a total of five times, twice restored, paying a phoros of 3 tal. in 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 26 ) and 8 , 700 dr. in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 33 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 99 ). In 310 it was incorporated into the new city of Antigoneia, later Alexandreia. In late C3 a decree probably of the Kebrenians was set up in Assos in honour of a troop of soldiers and their commander for coming to their assistance ( I.Assos 4 ; cf. L. Robert ( 1951 ) 33 ). Kebren had imposing fortifications sited in µ άλα ισχυρΩsubiotaῶ χωρίΩsubiotaω (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 17 ), with walls (ibid. 18 ) and gates (ibid. 19 ). The existing walls are dated to C5l or earlier (Cook ( 1973 ) 330 ). They measure 5 km in circumference and enclose an area of c. 90 ha; they were reported to survive over 10 feet high and are 8 -10 feet thick (Leaf ( 1923 ) 171 -73 , citing Calvert; Judeich ( 1898 b ) 539 ; Cook ( 1973 ) 328 -31 ). On the citadel are a few remains of a separate acropolis wall (Cook ( 1973 ) 334 ). Numerous ancient building remains have been noted on the site. Kebren minted in the Archaic and Classical periods. ( 1 ) Silver, C6 : obv . head of ram; rev . incuse square. ( 2 ) Silver, C5 : denominations: diobol, trihemiobol, obol, tritartemorion, tetartemorion: obv . head of ram; legend: ΚΕΒΡΕΝΕ or ΚΕΒΡΕ ; rev . incuse square.

Robert ( 1951 ) 17 -36 argued that Kebren was refounded under the name Antiocheia in the early Heltic period and underwent synoecism with Birytis between 280 and 270 . This has been contested by Cook ( 1988 ) 17 -19 ."

Kolonai is called a polis in the political and urban senses combined by Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 13 , 16 (cf. Hansen ( 2000 ) 175 ). In Ps.-Skylax 95 Kolonai is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες . . . αιasperacuteδε . It is called a polis in the political sense by Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 13 ; its name has also been restored ( Κ [ ολόνε ]) at IG i³ 71 . iii . 135 in a list of Aktaiai poleis which uses polis in the political sense. It was one of the πολίσ µ ατα that were incorporated by synoecism into Alexandreia in 310 (Strabo 13 . 1 . 47 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally by C4 coins ( infra ). The individual city-ethnic is used externally by Strabo 13 . 1 . 62 in reference to the local historian Daes, who should be dated not later than C4l (Schwartz, RE iv. 1982 ). It belonged to the region of the Troad and was called Κολωναιgrave αιasper ΤρΩsubiotaωάδαι by Thuc. 1 . 131 . 1 (but this may be a reference to the homonymous place in the territory of Lampsakos). The territory was formerly part of the Tenedian Peraia (Strabo 13 . 1 . 47 ). The settlement was founded by Aiolians (Strabo 13 . 1 . 62 ) and was reputed to be the home of the Thrakian king Kyknos, killed by Achilles, in a story told in post-Homeric epic (Leaf ( 1923 ) 219 ). If the toponym is correctly restored in IG i³ 71 , Kolonai was one of the Ακταῖαι πόλεις in the Delian League and was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 124 and 135 ( Κ [ ολονε ], 1 , 000 dr.). The Spartan regent Pausanias took refuge here and made contact with the Persian king after leaving Byzantion in 478 (Thuc. 1 . 131 . 1 , unless this passage refers to the Kolonai in the interior of the territory of Lampsakos). The city possessed a sanctuary of Apollo Killaios introduced by Aiolians (Strabo 13 . 1 . 62 ). The site extends ' 720 by 230 paces'on a hill-top, with a possible acropolis area at the south end about 200 paces across (Leaf ( 1923 ) 223 -24 ). Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 13 ( Κολωνάς . . . τοῖς τείχεσιν ) suggests that the city possessed a circuit wall in C4e. The city minted bronze coins between c. 400 and 310 : obv . head of Athena; rev .

Lamponeia was an Aiolic settlement (Strabo 13 . 1 . 58 ). It is called a polis in the political sense ( πόλις ΤρΩsubiotaωάδος ) in Steph. Byz. 410 . 11 , derived from Hecat. fr. 223 , but we cannot be certain that the site-classification stems from Hekataios (Hansen ( 1997 ) 17 -18 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally by C4 coins ( infra ), and externally by the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ). Lamponeia was captured by Otanes, the Persian satrap of the Hellespontine area, c. 512 (Hdt. 5 . 26 ). It is thought to have been an original member of the Delian League since 478 / 7 ( ATL iii. 206 ). It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded either by toponym ( IG i³ 267 . i . 28 ) or by cityethnic ( IG i³ 270 . i . 38 ) from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 11 ) to 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 16 ) a total of fourteen times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 11 ), but 1 , 400 dr. in 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 16 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 85 ). In the Archaic period (?) it received a fortification wall which enclosed an area of about 27 ha (Cook ( 1973 ) 262 ). Lamponeia struck coins of silver and bronze from C5l to C4m.

Byz. 413 . 5 -6 , referring to all the Larisas, indicates that the city-ethnic for persons was Λαρισαῖος , and for divinities Λαρισευacuteς . It is Λαρισαῖος in Strabo 13 . 1 . 48 . Hom. Il . 2 . 840 -41 says that Larisa was inhabited by φυtildeλα Πελασγῶν . Larisa is called a polis in the political and urban senses combined by Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 13 , 16 (cf. Hansen ( 2000 ) 175 ). In Ps.-Skylax 95 Larisa is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες . . . αιasperacuteδε , and its name has been restored ([ Λάρι ] σα ) at IG i³ 77 . iv . 19 in a list of Aktaiai poleis which uses polis in the political sense. It was one of the πολίσ µ ατα that were incorporated by synoecism into Alexandreia Troas in 310 (Strabo 13 . 1 . 47 ). The name of the territory was ηasper Λαρισαῖα (Strabo 13 . 1 . 48 ). It included the hot salt springs of Tragasai (Ath. 2 . 43 A). Hom. Il . 2 . 840 -41 and 17 . 301 refers to the fertility of the land, Λάρισαν εριβώλακα . If the toponym is correctly restored in IG i³ 71 and 77 ( supra ), it was one of the Ακταῖαι πόλεις in the Delian League and was assessed for tribute of 3 tal. in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 124 , 130 ) and in 422 / 1 for an unknown amount ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 14 , 19 ). It is located εν τηsubiotaηtilde Τρωικηsubiotaηtilde by Ath. 2 . 43 A, and according to Strabo 13 . 1 . 47 was formerly a city of the Tenedian peraia . Larisa was one of the places visited by the Delphic theorodokoi c. 200 (Plassart ( 1921 ) 8 ; Cook ( 1988 ) 12 ). It may have sent theoroi to Samothrake (Cook ( 1962 ) 100 , ( 1973 ) 221 ). The site on a low hill measuring ' 320 × 350 paces' , extending north from the base of the hill to the harbour; with building foundations and BG pottery (Leaf ( 1923 ) 225 ); Archaic and Classical sherds are reported (Cook ( 1988 ) 14 ).

The toponym is attested in the forms Νεάνδρεια ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 10 ( 454 / 3 )) or Νεάνδρεα ( IG i³ 272 . i . 30 ( 440 / 39 )) or Νεάνδρειον , τό (Theopomp. fr. 374 apud Steph. Byz. 471 . 5 ) or Νεανδρία , ηasper (Strabo 13 . 1 . 47 ). The city-ethnics are Νεανδρειευacuteς ( IG i³ 280 . ii . 12 ( 432 / 1 )) or Νεανδριευacuteς (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 18 ; Strabo 13 . 1 . 51 ; cf. Cook ( 1988 ) 14 n. 23 ). Neandreia was one of the Aiolic cities of the Troas (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 16 ). In Ps.-Skylax 96 Neandreia is the third toponym listed after the heading Αιολίδες δεgrave πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε . It is called a polis in the urban and political senses combined by Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 16 . The collective city-ethnic is used internally on C5 -C4 coins ( infra ) and externally on the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ). The name of the territory was ηasper Νεανδρίς (Strabo 10 . 3 . 20 , following Demetrios of Skepsis).It included the Samonion plain, which was probably to the east of the city in the Skamandros valley (Cook ( 1973 ) 315 ). It overlooked and presumably adjoined Hamaxitos on the west (Strabo 13 . 1 . 51 ). A foundation story is recorded in Dictys Cretensis, which may originate with C5 or C4sources, before the foundation of Alexandreia Troas (Schwertheim ( 1994 ) 21 -24 ). Neandreia was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded first by toponym ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 34 ), later by city-ethnic ( IG i³ 280 . ii . 12 ), from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 10 ) to 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 37 ) a total of twelve times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 2 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 10 ) in all years. It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 81 ) and in 410 / 9 ( IG i³ 100 . iii . 4 ). It was one of the cities incorporated in Alexandreia Troas in 310 . The origin of the civic centre (temple, agora, stoa) dates to the Archaic period, including a C6 temple, perhaps dedicated to Apollo (Wiegartz ( 1994 )), an agora and stoa, possible remains of a theatre (Trunk ( 1994 )), extensive housing and a complex internal drainage system. The western section of the housing area was built on a rectangular organised grid dating to C4 (Maischatz ( 1994 )). There was a fortified area at the west end of the site, arguably protected by the earliest fortifications of C6 . These were built from 2 -2 . 5 mthick rough polygonal masonry, not laid in horizontal or even courses; they had five entrances. New walls were built in late C5 or early C4 . They were 3 . 2 km long and 2 . 9 m thick, made from granite ashlar blocks. There were eight gates and eleven rectangular towers, two with interior courtyards (Schulz ( 1994 ), ( 2000 )). These walls may be indirectly referred to at Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 16 ( εις ταgrave τείχη δέχεσθαι . . . Νεανδρεῖς . . . επείθοντο ). The city minted silver and bronze issues from c. 430 -310 : denominations: drachm, hemidrachm, obol, hemiobol: obv . head of Apollo, or helmet; rev . altar and laurel tree, or ram,or horse, or triskeles, or ear of corn; legend: ΝΕΑΝ or ΝΕΑ (Head, HN ² 547 ; cf.

Ant. Rom . 1 . 47 . 2 , who draws on Hellan.fr. 31 . Its name has been restored ([ ' Οφρυacuteν ] ειον ) at IG i³ 77 . iv . 20 in a list of Aktaiai poleis which uses polis in the political sense. The collective internal use of the city-ethnic is attested by C4s coins ( infra ). If the toponym is correctly restored in IG i³ 71 and 77 , it was one of the Ακταῖαι πόλεις in the Delian League and was assessed for tribute of 5 tal. in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 124 , 131 : ' Ο [ φρυacuteνειον ]) and for an unknown amount in 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 14 , 20 : [ ' Οφρυacuteν ] ειον ). An Athenian inscription listing confiscated goods being offered for public sale ( IG i³ 430 . 11 ( 414 / 13 )) refers to επικαρπία τ ˜ ες γ ˜ ες τ ˜ ες εν ' Οφρυνείοι . This implies landownership by Athenian citizens. Dem. 33 . 20 mentions that Parmenon lived here in exile from Byzantion,losing his wife and children when their house was destroyed by an earthquake. Ophryneion was the reputed burial place of Hektor (schol. Hom. Il. 13 . 1 ). Strabo 13 . 1 . 30 reports that the grove of Hektor occupied a conspicuous site, and Hektor appears on the coins. The site occupies a prominent hill some 100 m high, forming a conspicuous headland with a steep brow, giving the site its name.Walls (undated) enclosed the whole acropolis and are reported as 2 m thick without mortar; the upper part of the acropolis is separated by a deep trench and embankment (Leaf ( 1923 ) 153 -54 , citing Calvert's description). Many buildings are reported on the acropolis and the slopes to the west and north-west. Ophryneion minted silver and bronze c. 350 -300 : denominations: hemidrachm, trihemiobol: obv . head of Hektor, or Zeus; rev . mounted naked youth, or Dionysos, or Hektor; legend: ΟΦΡΥΝΕΩΝ or ΟΦΡΥ (Head, HN ² 547 ; SNG Cop.

The toponym is * Παλαιπερκώτη , reconstructed from ηasper πάλαι Περκώτη (Strabo 13 . 1 . 20 , infra ) and the city-ethnic Παλαιπερκόσιος ( IG i³ 272 . i . 28 ). The Palaiperkosioi were members of the Delian League. They belonged to the Hellespontine district and are recorded from 451 / 50 ( IG i³ 262 . ii . 14 ) to 421 / 20 ( IG i³ 285 . ii . 80 ) a total of fourteen times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 500 dr. ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 39 ) in all years. They were linked with the Perkosioi in 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 19 -20 , completely restored) and probably assessed in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 100 , partly restored). In a passage that is certainly corrupt, Strabo ( 13 . 1 . 20 ) made some observation about a change of name ( ηasper πάλαι Περκώτη µ ετωνο µ άσθη , οasper τόπος ). The change of name, however, seems to be that attested from Perkote to Perkope (see entry for Perkote),and it is not clear whether this passage refers to Palaiperkote at all. The site was probably located at Erda˘ g, where a large Archaic (?) fortification wall has been reported (Judeich ( 1898 b ) 546 ; cf. Schulz ( 2000 ) 23 )."

The form Περκώπη occurs in lesser MSS of these authors and was current after the Heltic period; see Eust. Il . 840 . 46 on Il . 11 . 229 ; Ath. 1 . 29f , discussion by Ruge ( 1938 ). The city-ethnic was Περκώσιος (Hom. Il . 6 . 30 ) or Περκόσιος ( IG i³ 272 . i . 33 ). Perkote is called a polis in the urban sense by Hdt. 5 . 117 . 1 . In Ps.-Skylax 94 Perkote is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε . The city-ethnic was used in its collective sense externally by the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ). Perkote was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded either by toponym ( IG i³ 266 . i . 21 ) or by city-ethnic ( IG i³ 272 . i . 33 ) from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 17 , partly restored) to 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . iii . 26 ) a total of thirteen times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr.

Perhaps the Perkosioi were jointly listed with Palaiperkosioi in 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . ii . 19 -20 , both ethnics completely restored). In 387 / 6 Antalkidas brought his fleet to anchor at Perkote (Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 25 ). According to later sources, Perkote provided Themistokles with his bed linen (Plut. Them . 29 ; schol. Ar.

Its location is uncertain (Leaf ( 1923 ) 210 ). At 13 . 1 . 45 Strabo refers to a fortified settlement ( τειχηtildeρες χωρίον ) called Πολίχνα or Πολίχνη on the territory of Skepsis. The toponym is possibly to be connected with the (restored) ethnic [ Πολι ] χνῖται , a community in the Hellespontine district assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 76 ), thus ATL i. 541 . The common alternation Polichnaioi/Polichnitai is attested in the case of the Erythraian Polichnitai/aioi (no. 860 ). If the restoration and the identification are accepted, Polichna was presumably a polis and perhaps a dependency of Skepsis already in C5 ."

Rhoiteion is called a polis in the urban sense by Hdt. 7 . 43 . 2 , and in Ps.-Skylax 95 Rhoiteion is the second toponym listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες . . . αιasperacuteδε . It was one of the Aktaiai poleis mentioned by Thuc. 4 . 52 . 2 and IG i³ 77 . iv . 16 , where polis is used in the political sense. The collective city-ethnic is attested internally by C4s coins ( infra ); the individual city-ethnic is attested externally by C3f inscriptions ( IG xi . 4 582 ; IG xi . 2 163 .B. g . 18 ), but SEG 12 88 ( 332 / 1 ) has been interpreted as a grant of proxeny to a Rhoiteieus. The name of the territory was τοgrave ' Ροίτειον (Leaf ( 1923 ) 157 ). It probably extended west and south to the river Simoeis, and east to Ophryneion. It included the burial tumulus of Ajax (whose statue was returned to the Rhoiteians by Augustus (Strabo 13 . 1 . 30 ), and an unlocated colony called Πόλιον , which was renamed Πόλισ µ α in Strabo's day (Strabo 13 . 1 . 42 ). Rhoiteion was founded by Dorians from Astypalaia, who also founded the undefended colony of Polion, in C7 /C6 , which was demolished soon afterwards (Strabo 13 . 1 . 42 ). Rhoiteion was one of the Ακταῖαι πόλεις in the Delian League and was assessed for tribute of 8 tal. in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 124 , 126 , toponym restored) and for an unknown amount in 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 14 and 16 ). In 424 it was briefly seized by refugees from Mytilene and other refugees from Lesbos, but returned on payment of 2 , 000 Phokaian staters (Thuc. 4 . 52 . 2 ). Μοιρίας Αντιφάνου ' Ροιτευacuteς was honoured in a C3f proxeny decree of Delos ( IG xi . 4 582 ). It was absorbed by Ilion in a synoecism after 189 (Livy 38 . 37 ). The acropolis is reported to be fortified on three sides with two towers (undated); the fourth side was precipitous. There were buildings within the acropolis, while the lower town extends to the south (Cook ( 1973 ) 77 -90 ). The city minted silver coins c. 350 -300 : denomination: tetrobol: obv . head of Apollo; rev . triskeles; legend: ΡΟΙΤΕΙ (Head, HN ² 548 )."
791,Sigeion (Sigeieus),Troas,40.0,26.1,775,3512,"791 . Sigeion (Sigeieus) Map 56 . Lat. 40 . 00 , long. 26 . 10 . Size of territory: 2 . Type A: α . The toponym is Σίγειον , τό ( IG i³ 1144 .A. ii .a. 32 ( 464 ); Hdt. 5 . 65 . 3 ; Thuc. 6 . 59 . 3 ; Arist. Hist. an . 547 a 5 ).; also Σίγη , ηasper (Hecat. fr. 221 ; Ps.-Skylax 95 ). For the identification of Σίγη with Σίγειον , see Bürchner ( 1923 ) 2276 . The city-ethnic is Συκεευacuteς ( Syll . ³ 2 .A = LSAG ² pl. 71 43 -44 (C6 )) or Σιγευευacuteς ( Syll . ³ 2 .B (C5 )) or Σιγειευacuteς ( Syll . ³ 2 .B (C5 ); IG i³ 272 . i . 35 ) or Σιγευacuteς ( I.Kios 1 . 4 (C4 )). Sigeion is described as a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 5 . 94 . 2 and in Ps.-Skylax 95 Sige (Sigeion) is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις ' Ελληνίδες . . . αιasperacuteδε . Other references to Sigeion as a polis are late: Harp. Σ 11 and Strabo 13 . 1 . 31 ( κατεσπασ µ ένη πόλις ). The collective city-ethnic is attested internally in C6 by Syll . ³ i . 2 , and externally in C5 by the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ) and IG i³ 17 (C5m/s), which is a decree granting privileges to the city. Individually, the city-ethnic is applied externally in I.Kios 1 (C4 ) and by later sources to the C5 historian from the city, Damastes ( = FGrHist 5 ; cf. T est. 1 , 2 , 4 ). Its territory is termed χώρη by Hdt. 5 . 94 . 2 . Sigeion and Rhoiteion included the former territory of Ilion, until that city was refounded (Strabo 13 . 1 . 42 ). In the early C6 control of Sigeion was contested between Athenians and Mytilenians; the latter's base was the neighbouring polis of Achilleion (Hdt. 5 . 94 . 2 ). The oecist may have been the Athenian, Physkon, in C7l, when virtually the entire rest of the Troad was controlled by Lesbos (Strabo 13 . 1 . 8 ). Sigeion was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 25 ) to 418 / 17 ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 9 ) a total of fifteen times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 25 ) down to 418 / 17 , when it paid 1 tal. ( IG i³ 287 . ii . 9 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 93 ). In C4 , Tenedos claimed control over Sigeion (Arist. Rh . 1375 b 31 ; Anon. in Arist. Artem Rhet . 81 . 12 ). Strabo 13 . 1 . 39 (cf. 13 . 1 . 31 ) says that the city was demolished ( κατέσκαπται ) by the people of Ilion on account of its disobedience. The date must fall between c. 334 and Strabo's own time. Sigeion was usually ruled by an autocrat or a tyrant: Physkon, Athenian Olympic victor, in late C7 (Strabo 13 . 1 . 38 ); Hegesistratos, son of Peisistratos, in 520 s, and perhaps Hippias in 510 (Hdt. 5 . 94 . 1 ); Chares son of Theochares between c. 355 and 334 (Theopomp.fr. 105 apud Ath. 12 . 532 B; Arr. 1 . 12 . 1 ; schol. Dem. 3 . 21 ). A public decree of C2 has been recorded (Daux ( 1956 ); cf. BE ( 1958 ) 410 ). A prytaneion is mentioned in C6 ( Syll . ³ 2 A).The city walls were reputed to have been built with stones from Ilion by Archianax of Mytilene in C6 (Strabo 13 . 1 . 38 ). There was a C6 dedication of crater, base and stand by Phanodikos of Prokonnesos ( Syll . ³ 2 ). A C4 decree of Kios gave proxeny status and minor privileges to Αacuteδολος Αδόλου Σιγευacuteς ( I.Kios 1 ). Silver and bronze coins were minted in C4 , probably when Sigeion was controlled by Chares, c. 355 -334 . Denomination: hemidrachm: obv . head of Athena, or head of Zeus; rev . owl, crescent behind; legend: ΣΙΓΕ (Head, HN ² 549 ; Six ( 1894 ) 306 -7 )."
792,Skepsis (Skapsios),Troas,39.5,26.4,1197,6131,"792 . Skepsis (Skapsios) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 50 , long. 26 . 40 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Σκηtildeψις , ηasper (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 15 ; F.Delphes iii . 1 288 (C2 )); Παλαισκηtildeψις (Strabo 13 . 1 . 51 ). The city-ethnic is Σκάψιος (C5 coins, infra ), Σκάφσιος ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 27 ), Σκή [ ψιος ] ( IG i³ 100 . iii . 3 ; IG ii² 10364 (C3 ); F.Delphes iii . 1 288 (C2 )), Σκήψιος (coins, infra ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 21 ), Σκέ µ φσιος (Krateros fr. 24 , Krech ( 454 / 3 )). It is called a polis in the urban sense by Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 15 . In Ps.-Skylax 96 Skepsis is the second toponym listed after the heading Αιολίδες δεgrave πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε . In the political sense polis is used by Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 21 . Skepsis is repeatedly referred to as a polis in the political sense in a decree of 311 ( OGIS 6 . 2 , 4 , 11 , 15 ). The acropolis is mentioned by Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 21 ( εν τηsubiotaηtilde τῶν Σκηψίων ακροπόλει ). Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 21 also refers to its inhabitants as citizens in emphatic terms: παραδουgraveς δεgrave τοῖς πολίταις τηgraveν πόλιν , καιgrave παρακελευσά µ ενος ωasperacuteσπερ /asperacuteΕλληνας καιgrave ελευθέρους χρηtilde , ουasperacuteτω πολιτευacuteειν . This passage, however, also implies that the population was mixed. Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 28 also employs the term patris in relation to the city. The collective city-ethnic is used internally on coins ( infra ) and externally on the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ); the external individual use is attested in a C3epitaph from Athens ( Agora xvii 666 ). The name of the territory was ηasper Σκηψία (Strabo 13 . 1 . 33 ), and the city lay εν δεgrave τηsubiotaηtilde µ εσογαίΩsubiotaα τηtildeς ΤρΩsubiotaωάδος (Strabo 14 . 1 . 6 ). Its extent must have been large, but the topography remains extremely obscure. According to Strabo 13 . 1 . 45 , it included a walled settlement called Πολίχνα (possibly itself a small polis ), and it was separated from the territory of Kebren by the river Skamandros (Strabo 13 . 1 . 33 ). The site of Palaiskepsis was said to be above Kebren in the highest parts of Mt. Ida near Polichna ( sic ) (Strabo 13 . 1 . 52 ). Strabo 13 . 1 . 51 describes the early but undated metoikesis from Palaiskepsis to Skepsis as follows: υasperacuteστερον κατωτέρω σταδίοις εasperξήκοντα µ ετΩsubiotaωκισθηtildeναι υasperποgrave Σκα µ άνδρου τουtilde /asperacuteΕκτορος καιgrave Ασκανίου τουtilde Αινείου παιδός . The figure of 60 stades was emended to 260 by Leaf ( 1923 ) 270 -71 , who was guided by Strabo's indications that Skepsis lay in the river basin of the Skamandros, while Palaiskepsis was in that of the Aisepos.Following this,Strabo 13 . 1 . 52 refers to the arrival of Milesian settlers to be joined in a sympoliteia at Skepsis, perhaps after the sack of Miletos in 494 , εῖτα Μιλήσιοι συνεπολιτευacuteθησαν αυτοῖς . C5 coins have the city-ethnic ΣΚΗ ( Α ) ΨΙΟΝ ΝΕ ( ΟΝ ) which may refer to the refoundation of Skepsis at this time. After 310 Skepsis was synoecised with Alexandreia by Antigonos,but restored to independence by Lysimachos (Strabo 13 . 1 . 52 ). Skepsis was originally an Aiolic city (implied by use of form ΣΚΑΨΙΟΝ on C5 coins, infra ); but there was a secondary foundation by Milesians after 494 (Leaf ( 1923 ) 272 -73 ). The original oecists, according to Strabo 13 . 1 . 52 -53 , following Demetrios of Skepsis, were Skamandrios and Askanios. Skepsis was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded in 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . viii . 4 , partly restored), in 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 27 ) and in 441 / 0 ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 31 ), paying a phoros of 1 tal. It was assessed for tribute possibly in 454 / 3 (Krateros fr. 24 , Krech) and in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 65 , completely restored), probably in 410 / 9 ( IG i³ 100 . iii . 4 , partly restored). Strabo 13 . 1 . 52 records a progression in its constitution from kingship (descendants of Skamandrios and Askanios), through oligarchy, to democracy (after the sympoliteia of Milesian settlers). Imhoof-Blümer ( 1901 ) 45 suggests that a coin with the legend ΑΝΤΗΝΟΡΟΣ is evidence for a dynast of that name in C2 or C1 ; but this may simply be an allusion to the legend of the Antenoridai, current at the city (Leaf ( 1923 ) 275 -80 ). The magistrates included a βασιλευacuteς (Strabo 13 . 1 . 52 ). The city received a letter from Antigonos in 311 ( OGIS 5 ), and the demos responded by passing a decree in the king's honour.The Skepsians resolved to set up a sanctuary and altar for Antigonos and to found an annual festival, which would feature a thysia , an agon , a stephanephoria and a panegyris . Among the city magistrates the text mentions a tamias , who was responsible for expenditure on the festival, and a grammateus , who was to supervise the erection of the stele inscribed with the decree in the sanctuary of Athena ( OGIS 6 ). An early Heltic citizenship decree testifies to the organisation of the citizens into phylai (Judeich ( 1898 a )). Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 15 implies that Skepsis was a fortified site. Derkylidas conducted a sacrifice to Athena on the acropolis in 399 (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 21 ; cf. OGIS 6 . 40 -41 ), perhaps suggesting a cult of Athena Polias. There was also a communal cult of Dionysos (coins, inscription of C4 /C3 ; SEG 26 1337 (regulations for priesthood of Dionysos Bambouleios, probably dating to C2 )). The city used the Ionic calendar, and the month Lenaion is attested ( SEG 26 1337 ). Skepsis minted silver and bronze coinage in C5 and C4 . ( 1 ) Silver, 460 -400 : denominations: drachm, triobol, trihemiobol, hemiobol: obv . horse (Pegasos); legend: ΣΚΑΨΙΟΝ or ΣΚΗΨΙΟΝ or ΣΚΗΨΙ ; rev . fir-tree; legend: Ν or ΝΕ (presumably νεῶν ).

793,Tenedos (Tenedios),Troas,39.5,26.05,587,2744,"793 . Tenedos (Tenedios) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 50 , long. 26 . 05 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Τένεδος , ηasper ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 109 ; Hdt. 1 . 151 . 2 ; Thuc. 3 . 35 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is Τενέδιος (Hdt. 1 . 151 . 3 ; IG i³ 261 . i . 6 ). T enedos is called a polis in the urban sense by Hdt. 1 . 151 . 2 and implicitly in Ps.-Skylax 95 (Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ). It is included among the poleis in the political sense mentioned at Hdt. 1 . 151 . 3 and is explicitly called polis in the political sense in IG ii² 232 ( 340 / 39 ). IG ii² 233 . 6 -7 ( 340 / 39 ) refers to the demos of the Tenedians. πατρίς is found in SEG 36 697 (C4 /C3 ) and CEG ii 717 (C4l/C3e), and πάτρα in Pind. Nem . 11 . 20 . The collective city-ethnic is used internally on C5m-C4 coins ( infra ) and externally by Hdt. 1 . 151 . 3 , Thuc. 3 . 2 . 3 and,e.g., IG i³ 261 . i . 6 ( 452 / 1 ). The individual city-ethnic is used externally on funerary inscriptions from Athens ( Agora xvii 672 -73 (C4 )) and in IG vii 2418 . 14 ( 355 -346 ). Ps.-Skylax 95 mentions the island and its harbour, καιgrave νηtildeσος καταgrave ταυtildeτα κεῖται Τένεδος καιgrave λι µ ήν , while Strabo 13 . 1 . 46 mentions two harbours. There was a single polis on the island of Tenedos (Hdt. 1 . 151 . 2 ), which also had territory on the peraia (Strabo 13 . 1 . 32 ); Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 7 uses χώρα about the island. Strabo 13 . 1 . 44 shows that Tenedian territory included Achaiion, while 13 . 1 . 46 indicates that it began at Sigeion and Achilleion, and included Achaiion. Strabo 13 . 1 . 47 , a corrupt passage, is usually restored to show that Larisa and Kolonai were previously parts of the Tenedian peraia ( ηtildeν δεgrave τΩsubiotaῶ ΑχαιίΩsubiotaω συνεχηgraveς ηasperacute τε Λάρισα καιgrave Κολωναί , τηtildeς &lt; Τενεδίων περ &gt; αίας ουtildeσαι πρότερον ). However, Cook ( 1973 ) 197 -98 proposes restoring ηtildeν δεgrave τΩsubiotaῶ ΑχαιίΩsubiotaω συνεχηgraveς ηasperacute τε Λάρισα καιgrave Κολωναί , τηtildeς &lt; Λεσβίων περ &gt; αίας ουtildeσαι πρότερον at this point, and this also makes good sense. Arist. Rh . 1375 b 31 with Anon. in Arist. Artem Rhet . 81 . 12 indicates that Tenedos claimed control over Sigeion some time in C4 . Tenedos was an Aiolic settlement founded from Lesbos (Hdt. 1 . 151 . 1 -2 ; Strabo 13 . 1 . 46 ). T enedos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Hellespontine district and is recorded from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . i . 6 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . iii . 30 ) a total of fifteen times, twice completely restored, usually paying a phoros of 2 tal., 5 , 280 dr. ( IG i³ 269 . ii . 8 ) but sometimes 4 tal., 3 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 267 . i . 29 ). It was assessed for ## II. The Poleis"
794,Antissa (Antissaios),Lesbos,39.15,26.0,1083,5462,"794 . Antissa (Antissaios) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 15 , long. 26 . 00 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Αacuteντισσα , ηasper (Thuc. 3 . 18 . 1 -2 ; Dem. 23 . 132 ). The city-ethnic is Αντισσαῖος (Thuc. 3 . 18 . 2 ; IG ii² 43 B. 20 ). Antissa is called a polis both in the urban sense (Ps.-Skylax 97 ; cf. Hdt. 1 . 151 . 2 ) and in the political sense (Arist. Oec . 1347 a 25 ). At Thuc. 3 . 18 . 1 polis is found in both senses simultaneously. The collective and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in inscriptions ( IG ii² 107 . 29 ( 368 / 7 )) and in literature (Arist. Pol . 1303 a 34 ). For the individual and external use, see Σωσίπολις Αντισσαῖος at Arist. Oec . 1347 a 25 . Antissa is implicitly called patris in Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 28 . The territory of Antissa covered c. 250 km ² . T o the south its neighbouring polis was Eresos, and their frontier was probably in the high upland between the two poleis , with sites such as the polygonal masonry tower Kourouklos (Spencer ( 1995 a ) no. 178 ) representing the border area. To the northeast it bordered on Methymna, and the frontier was probably between the forts at Selles (ibid. no. 205 ) and Ametelle (ibid. no. 202 ), both belonging to Methymna, and the forts at Koutlougouni (ibid. no. 190 ), Koja Dag (ibid. no. 193 ) and Skoteino (ibid.no. 201 ), all belonging to Antissa.According to Kontes ( 1978 ) 127 -28 , 312 -13 , Antissa possessed Issa and its territory reached the Gulf of Kalloni. However, the upland topography to the south and east of Antissa argues against the suggestion that their territory extended so far in this direction, and Kontes' views have also been criticised by Labarre ( 1996 ) 199 -200 . Issa could have belonged to Methymna. The Antissaians were members of the Delian League. They are unattested in the Athenian tribute lists which show that, like the other Lesbian poleis , the Antissaians provided ships instead of paying phoros (Thuc. 1 . 116 . 2 , 117 . 2 ). In 428 they joined the Mytilenaians in defecting from Athens (Thuc. 3 . 2 . 1 ). They were involved in the Mytilenaian attempt to synoecise Lesbos, and before the Athenian siege of Mytilene began, the Mytilenaians secured their position in Antissa, Pyrrha and Eresos and reinforced the fortifications of the three cities ( 3 . 18 . 1 ). A Methymnaian attack on Antissa was repelled ( 3 . 18 . 2 ). After Mytilene's surrender in 427 , the Athenians sent a squadron against Antissa and conquered the city ( 3 . 28 . 3 ). The territory, or at least a part of it, was surrendered to Athenian klerouchs ( 3 . 50 . 2 ). In 412 Antissa seems to have followed Chios and Mytilene and seceded from Athens once again (Thuc. 8 . 22 . 2 ). In any case, the juxtaposition at Thuc. 8 . 23 . 4 of Antissa and Methymna, which had revolted against Athens, indicates that Antissa had revolted too, and now sheltered some antiAthenian exiles from Chios (Diod. 13 65 . 3 ; cf. Gehrke, Stasis 23 , 45 ); but stasis between the two different ethnic groups led to civil war and the forceful expulsion of the exiles (Arist. Pol . 1303 a 25 -28 , 34 -35 ). In C4e Antissa was allied with Lakedaimon, but in 390 / 89 Thrasyboulos imposed a settlement by which the city joined the Athenians (Diod. 14 . 94 . 4 ). The settlement undoubtedly included the repatriation of some exiles to Mytilene (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 28 ). Antissa was a member of the Second Athenian Naval League, but, by contrast with Mytilene, it was not among the founding members. It joined the alliance in, probably, 375 ( IG ii² 43 B. 20 ; Brun ( 1988 ) 377 ), and Antissaian representatives in the allied synedrion are attested for the year 368 / 7 ( IG ii² 107 . 29 ). Antissa joined the Corinthian League, probably in 337 , and was then ruled by a tyrant (Dem. 17 . 7 ; Bosworth ( 1980 ) 179 ). In 333 the city was taken by the Persian admiral Memnon, alongside the other Lesbian poleis (Diod. 17 . 29 . 2 ; Arr. Anab . 2 . 1 . 1 ), but the Makedonians reconquered Antissa in the following year (Arr. Anab . 3 . 2 . 6 ; Curt. 4 . 5 . 22 ) and deposed the tyrant (Dem. 17 . 7 ). At the coastal site of Antissa, on the promontory of Ovriokastro, are few visible remains earlier than mediaeval, but in the 1930 s limited excavations revealed Geometric/Archaic structures and graves on the landward side. The earlier of two superimposed apsidal buildings appears to be of Geometric date,the later successor building dating to the early Archaic period (Lamb ( 1931 -32 )). The end of a late Classical stoa was also uncovered, and an Archaic street; references for all finds are collected in Spencer ( 1995 a ) no. 161 , ( 1995 b ) 285 -87 . In one of the cemeteries there is evidence of a small temenos and tomb cult (Spencer 1995 d ; for the link of the cult to the region of Antissa, see Harisis et al . ( 2002 a ), ( 2002 b ). We know from Thuc. 3 . 18 . 1 that Antissa was walled in 428 / 7 and that the fortifications were reinforced in that year. There are stretches of a large-scale wall on the south side of the acropolis recorded by Lamb during fieldwork in the 1930 s (Spencer ( 1995 a ) 62 -63 ), but whether these were part of a circuit wall, and its precise dating, are still unclear. As reconstructed by Koldewey ( 1890 ) pl. 6 , the walls enclosed an area of c. 18 ha. One of the so-called Lesbian coins ( supra ) has a monogram which has been interpreted as ΑΝ , standing for Antissa (Babelon, Traité ii. 1 . 349 -50 no. 568 )."

The toponym is Αρίσβα , ηasper (Hdt. 1 . 151 . 2 ) or, in the Attic-Ionic dialect, Αρίσβη (Steph. Byz. 3 , 8 -9 ). Arisba is described by Herodotos as the sixth polis on Lesbos, where polis is used in the urban and the political senses simultaneously. Before C5m and probably in C6 , the city was conquered by Methymna; its population was exposed to andrapodismos (Hdt. 1 . 151 . 2 ); and the territory was incorporated into that of Methymna (Strabo 13 . 1 . 21 ). The site of Arisba is probably to be identified with the ancient remains on the low acropolis of 'Palaeokastro'near the modern village of that name near Kalloni, and has been known since the nineteenth century. There are extensive traces of a polygonal masonry fortification wall around the acropolis, and along the northern side of the plateau. As reconstructed by Koldewey ( 1890 ) pl. 13 , the walls may have enclosed an area of c. 8 ha. There are remains of megaronlike houses on the hill, but the precise dating of both walls and houses is unclear and could not be clarified even through excavation by the local archaeological ephoreia. (Koldewey ( 1890 ) pls. 13 , 14 ; Kontes ( 1978 ) fig. 48 ; other references collected in Spencer ( 1995 a ) no. 116 ; see also Spencer ( 1995 b ) 287 -88 and fig. 7 )."
796,Eresos (Eresios),Lesbos,39.1,25.55,1826,8587,"796 . Eresos (Eresios) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 10 ; long. 25 . 55 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The toponym is /acuteΕρεσος , ηasper (Thuc. 8 . 100 . 3 ; Dem. 17 . 7 ; Archestratos fr. 5 . 5 , Olson and Sens; Arcadius 75 . 20 ) or ' Ερεσός (Ps.-Skylax 97 ; IG xii . 2 533 . 1 -2 (C3 /C2 )) or ' Ερεσσός (Arist. fr. 655 , Rose; Diod. 17 . 29 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ερέσιος ( IG i³ 94 . 4 (C5l); IG xii . 2 526 .C. 31 (C4l); Thuc. 8 . 23 . 4 ). Eresos is called a polis in the urban sense ( IG xii . 2 526 .A 8 , 11 , B 2 , 11 (C4l); Thuc. 3 . 35 . 1 ; Ps.Skylax 97 ; cf. Hdt. 1 . 151 . 2 ), in the territorial sense ( IG xii . 2 526 .D 7 , 28 , 30 , 37 ), and in the political sense ( IG xii . 2 526 .A 27 , B 30 , C3 , D 21 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins of C4 /C3 ( infra ) and externally in inscriptions ( IG ii² 107 . 29 ; IG xi . 2 137 . 11 (C4l)) and in literature (Thuc. 8 . 23 . 4 ). For the individual and external use, see Θεόφραστος οasper ' Ερέσιος (Ath. 387 B) and Μυtildeς Πρωτέα ' Ερέσιος in a C4l proxeny decree from Megara ( IG vii 4 . 2 ). Eresos is implicitly called patris in Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 28 . The territory of Eresos probably covered c. 225 km ² . Already in the Archaic period it was marked by a line of installations in Lesbian masonry (Schaus and Spencer ( 1994 ) 414 -20 ), of which five have been identified: Spilios (Spencer ( 1995 a ) no. 141 ), Megalos Lakkos (ibid. no. 175 ), Bigla tou Aetou ( ibid . no. 187 , some 8 km west of the Gulf of Kalloni, but in Barr . placed near the coast), Apotheke (ibid. no. 130 ) and Makara (ibid. no. 131 ). T o the north it may have included Sigrion (although there are no remains antedating the Roman period known at this site, supra ). The frontier towards Antissa was probably the high upland area including Mount Ordymnos between the two poleis (see the description of the territory of Antissa, supra ). Along the north coast of the Gulf of Kalloni the frontier lay north of Apotheke ( infra ) but presumably south of what appears to be a fort at Issa ( supra ): Labarre ( 1996 ) 199 . The Eresians were members of the Delian League. They are unattested in the Athenian tribute lists, which shows that, like the other Lesbian poleis , the Eresians provided ships instead of paying phoros (Thuc. 1 . 116 . 2 , 117 . 2 ). In 428 they joined the Mytilenaians in defecting from Athens (Thuc. 3 . 2 . 1 ). They were involved in the Mytilenaian attempt to synoecise Lesbos, and before the Athenian siege of Mytilene began, the Mytilenaians secured their position in Antissa, Pyrrha and Eresos and reinforced the fortifications of the three cities ( 3 . 18 . 1 ). The Athenians gained possession of Pyrrha and Eresos only after Mytilene's surrender in 427 ( 3 . 35 . 1 ), and the territory, or at least a part of it, was surrendered to Athenian klerouchs ( 3 . 50 . 2 ). Eresos revolted against Athens once again in 412 ( 8 . 23 . 4 ), but was soon recaptured by the Athenians ( 8 . 23 . 5 ). In 411 , however, exiled Methymnian oligarchs provoked a new defection ( 8 . 100 . 3 ), and this time Eresos withstood the Athenians' attempt to take the city by siege ( 8 . 100 . 4 -5 , 101 . 1 , 103 . 2 ). In C4e Eresos was allied with Lakedaimon, but in 390 / 89 Thrasyboulos imposed a settlement by which the city joined the Athenians (Diod. 14 . 94 . 4 ). The settlement undoubtedly included the repatriation of some exiles to Mytilene (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 28 ). Eresos was a member of the Second Athenian Naval League, but, by contrast with Mytilene, it was not among the founding members. It joined the alliance in, probably, 375 ( IG ii² 43 B. 21 ; Brun ( 1988 ) 377 ), and Eresian representatives in the allied synedrion are attested for the year 368 / 7 ( IG ii² 107 . 29 ). Eresos joined the Corinthian League,probably in 337 , and was then a tyranny (Dem. 17 . 7 ; Bosworth ( 1980 ) 179 ) ruled by Hermon, Heraios and Apollodoros ( IG xii . 2 526 D. 18 -21 ; Lott ( 1996 )), but in 333 the city was taken by the Persian admiral Memnon (Diod. 17 . 29 . 2 ; Arr. Anab . 2 . 1 . 1 ), and other tyrants were installed; viz . Agonippos ( IG xii . 2 526 A. 1 -32 , D 12 ) and Eurysilaos ( IG xii . 2 526 B. 1 -33 , D 12 ). The Makedonians reconquered Lesbos in the following year (Arr. Anab . 3 . 2 . 6 ) and deposed the tyrants (Dem. 17 . 7 ). They were handed over to the Eresians, who had them sentenced to death and executed ( IG xii . 2 526 , see infra ). Almost all we know about the political organisation of Eresos stems from a dossier of documents, all related to trials against ( 1 ) the tyrants Agonippos and Eurysilaos, and ( 2 ) the descendants of the former tyrants ( IG xii . 2 526 = Rec. Inscr. Jur. Gr . 27 = Tod 191 = Heisserer ( 1980 ) 27 -78 ; cf. the analysis in Koch ( 2001 )). One decree reports the trial and conviction of Agonippos (A. 1 -32 ), another the trial and conviction of Eurysilaos (B. 1 -34 ), a third one the trial of the descendants of the former tyrants (A. 33 -41 , C. 1 -20 ), followed by letters from Philip Arrhidaios and Antigonos (C. 21 -D. 3 ) and, finally, a C4l decree of the Eresian people confirming all former verdicts (D. 4 -39 ). Eresos was probably a democracy when the trials of the tyrants were heard. A prytanis served as the eponymous official ( πρότανις , C. 29 ; cf. the list of πρυτάνεις ' Ερεσίων drawn up by Phanias, the C4s pupil of Aristotle (frr. 17 -19 , Wehrli)). Decrees ( ψαφίσ µ ατα , D. 33 -34 ) were passed in a general assembly ( εκκλησία , A. 26 ) by the people ( δαtilde µ ος , A. 33 , 41 ) or by the council ( βόλλα , C. 31 , D. 4 ) and the people in accordance with a probouleumatic procedure ([ πρ ] οεβώλλε [ υσε ], D. 4 ). It was the people ( δαtilde µ ος ) who in both cases decided to appoint a court ( δικαστήριον , D. 13 -15 , 24 ) to hear the trial of the tyrants, and speakers for the prose- cution ( συνήγοροι , C. 28 -34 ) were appointed by the polis (C. 30 ). It is unknown whether the dikasterion was coextensive with the ekklesia . The trials were warranted by a law against tyrants and their descendants (A. 24 -26 , D. 16 -17 , 31 -32 ). At the trial Agonippos was found guilty and sentenced to death by 876 votes to 7 (A. 30 -32 ); Eurysilaos was sentenced to death too (D. 14 -15 ), and at the trial of the descendants of the former tyrants the Eresians confirmed the earlier sentence of exile (C. 22 -28 ). The number of votes cast, altogether 883 , points to a total of at least 1 , 000 adult male citizens and a population of at least 4 , 000 citizens plus foreigners and slaves. Eresos sent envoys to Alexander the Great c. 332 ( IG xii . 2 526 A. 33 ) and received envoys from Athens in 368 / 7 ( IG ii² 107 . 31 -34 ). Eresian citizens received proxenia from Delphi ( F.Delphes iii . 4 395 ( c. 360 -320 )), Megara ( IG vii 4 (C4l)) and Zeleia (Michel 531 (C4 )). Only limited excavations and surveys have taken place on the site of Lesbos' westernmost polis , and discoveries have been mainly Roman or early Christian in date (Koldewey ( 1890 ) pls. 8 , 9 ; Kontes ( 1978 ) figs. 56 , 57 ; Schaus and Spencer ( 1994 ); references to finds at the site are collected in Spencer ( 1995 a ) no. 135 , ( 1995 b ) 288 and fig. 8 ). Some remains of a fortification wall in Lesbian-style masonry, probably Archaic,survive on the acropolis (Koldewey ( 1890 ) pl. 9 ). As reconstructed by Koldewey ( 1890 ) pl. 6 , the walls enclosed an area of c. 5 ha. An Archaic Aiolic capital (probably either from a votive column or temple) was dredged up out of the harbour and is now in the museum at Mytilene (Spencer ( 1995 a ) no. 135 and n. 61 (p. 30 ); Archontidhou ( 1999 ) 28 ).An Archaic relief of a seated Kybele in naiskos from the site suggests a sanctuary (Spencer ( 1995 a ) no. 138 ; Archontidhou ( 1999 ) 93 ). At the site of Apotheke near the entrance to the Gulf of Kalloni stands the best-preserved structure in Lesbian-style masonry on the island, a large Late Archaic temple platform (Koldewey ( 1890 ) pl. 15 ; Schaus and Spencer ( 1994 ) 416 -17 and fig. 3 ; Spencer ( 1995 a ) no. 130 , ( 2000 ) 72 ). We know from Thucydides that Eresos was walled in 428 / 7 , that the fortifications were reinforced in that year ( 3 . 18 . 1 ), and that the city was besieged in 412 ( 8 . 100 . 4 -5 ). Eresos struck bronze coins in C4 /C3 . The most frequent types are: obv . head of Hermes wearing petasos; rev . cornear, or caduceus; legend: ΕΡΕΣΙ or ΕΡΕ (Head, HN ² 560 ; SNG Cop.Lesbos 339 -43 ; for the C4 date of the earliest coins, see IGCH no. 1227 )."
797,Methymna (Methymnaios),Lesbos,39.2,26.1,1831,9021,"797 . Methymna (Methymnaios) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 20 ; long. 26 . 10 . Size of territory: probably 3 , later 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Μήθυ µ να , ηasper (Thuc. 8 . 100 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 6 . 38 ; Dem. 44 . 9 ). The epichoric form of the city-ethnic is Μαθυ µ ναῖος (coins, infra ), the Attic-Ionic form is Μηθυ µ ναῖος ( IG i³ 353 . 66 ( 420 / 19 ); Hdt. 1 . 23 . 1 ). Methymna is called a polis both in the urban sense (Xen. Hell . 1 . 6 . 13 ; Ps.Skylax 97 ; cf. Hdt. 1 . 151 . 2 ) and in the political sense ( IG ii² 40 . 23 ( 378 / 7 ); Hdt. 1 . 151 . 2 , 3 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 28 ; Isoc. Ep . 7 . 9 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and externally in inscriptions ( IG i³ 353 . 66 ( 420 / 19 )) and in literature (Hdt. 1 . 151 . 1 ; Thuc. 3 . 2 . 3 ). For the individual and external use, see Αρίων οasper Μηθυ µ ναῖος (Hdt. 1 . 23 ). Methymna is implicitly called patris in Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 28 . The territory was called ηasper Μηθυ µ ναία (Ant. 5 . 21 ) and may originally have covered less than 200 km ² (Mason ( 1993 ) 229 ), but after the conquest of Arisba probably measured more than 400 km ² . T o the west it bordered on Antissa, and the frontier probably lay along the forts at Selles (Spencer ( 1995 a ) no. 205 ) and Ametelle (ibid. no. 202 ), both belonging to Methymna, and the forts at Koutlougouni (ibid. no. 190 ), Koja Dag (ibid. no. 193 ) and Skoteino (ibid. no. 201 ), all belonging to Antissa. On the east coast of Lesbos Methymna bordered on Mytilene,and its territory may have included Aigeiros (Labarre ( 1996 ) 194 ), although the location of the latter site is still unclear; see the list of nonpolis sites supra . The frontier between Methymna and Mytilene may have been as far north as Cape Tsakmák (Mason ( 1993 ) 231 -48 ), but this suggestion remains to be proved. Towards the Gulf of Kalloni, after the disappearance of Arisba, Methymna bordered on Pyrrha to the south-east, and the frontier was probably at Messon, the common shrine for all of Lesbos (Mason ( 1993 ) 231 -32 ). Further to the west Methymna's territory at the Gulf of Kalloni may have extended to the site of Issa and bordered on Eresos somewhere north of Apotheke (see supra ). The only historical event antedating the Classical period is Herodotos' piece of information that Methymna conquered Arisba, the sixth polis on Lesbos, and exposed its population to andrapodismos (Hdt. 1 . 151 . 1 , supra ). Methymna was a member of the Delian League. The Lesbians were among those who in 478 encouraged the Athenians to replace Sparta as the hegemon in the war against Persia (Plut. Arist . 23 . 4 ), and the Methymnians must have been among the original members of the League. In spite of Mytilenaian collaboration with an anti-Athenian faction in Methymna (Thuc. 3 . 18 . 1 ), the Methymnians remained loyal to Athens when the rest of Lesbos revolted in 428 (Thuc. 3 . 2 . 1 , 5 . 1 , 50 . 2 ), and they maintained their status as autonomoi allies who, instead of paying phoros , took part in the campaigns with their armed forces (Thuc. 6 . 85 . 2 , 7 . 57 . 5 ). Accordingly, they are not recorded in the Athenian tribute lists. In 412 Methymna was the first Lesbian polis that revolted from Athens (Thuc. 8 . 22 . 2 , 23 . 4 ), but the city was soon recovered by the Athenians ( 8 . 23 . 6 , 100 . 2 ). In 411 a group of oligarchic exiles made a vain attempt to win the city (Thuc. 8 . 100 . 3 ). Methymna remained in Athenian hands (Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 12 ) until 406 , when the city was betrayed by a pro-Lakedaimonian faction to a Peloponnesian force under Kallikratides (Xen. Hell . 1 . 6 . 12 -15 , 38 ; Diod. 13 . 76 . 5 ). The Methymnaians were still allied with Sparta in 390 / 89 (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 28 ) when, supported by pro-Athenian exiles settled in Mytilene, Thrasyboulos launched an attack on Methymna. He won a battle and ravaged the territory but could not conquer the city (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 28 -30 ; Diod. 14 . 94 . 4 ). A decade later Methymna had changed sides.It was one of the founding members of the Second Athenian Naval League. A separate treaty between Athens and Methymna was concluded in the autumn of 378 ( IG ii² 42 ), and Mytilene is listed among the allies in the so-called Charter of the League ( IG ii² 43 . 81 = Staatsverträge 257 ), and their representatives in the allied synedrion are attested for the year 368 / 7 ( IG ii² 107 . 28 ). Methymna sent envoys to Athens in 378 / 7 ( IG ii² 40 . 24 -25 ), and Athens sent envoys to Methymna ( IG ii² 107 . 31 -34 ( 368 / 7 )). In 333 Methymna was taken by the Persian admiral Memnon alongside the other Lesbian poleis (Diod. 17 . 29 . 2 ; Arr. Anab . 2 . 1 . 1 ), but by a peaceful agreement the Makedonians regained the small cities on Lesbos in the following year (Arr. Anab . 3 . 2 . 6 ). The group of oligarchic exiles attested in 411 (Thuc. 8 . 100 . 3 ) may indicate that, at that point, Methymna was a democracy; but otherwise next to nothing is known about the type of constitution until C4m, when it seems to have been an oligarchy (Theopomp. fr. 227 ; Gehrke, Stasis 113 ). From C4m Methymna was ruled by a series of tyrants (Berve ( 1967 ) 337 ; Bosworth ( 1980 ) 179 -80 ). The first was Kleommis, who restored law and order to Methymna (Theopomp. fr. 227 , where he is called Κλεο µ ένης ), recalled the exiles, and issued all citizens with hoplite weapons (Isoc. Ep . 7 . 8 -9 ). He was loyal to Athens and was awarded proxenia by the Athenians ( IG ii² 284 ). He was succeeded by Aristonymos, a friend of Memnon (Polyaen. Strat . 5 . 44 . 3 ). The next tyrant, Aristonikos, was deposed in 332 and, on Alexander's orders, handed over to the Methymnians, who had him tortured and executed (Arr. Anab . 3 . 2 . 4 -7 ; Curt. 4 . 5 . 19 -21 , 8 . 11 ). Only surveys and salvage excavations have been carried out at Methymna, the second in size of the poleis of the island; but a comprehensive study including a presentation of the remains visible up to the 1970 s has appeared (Buchholz ( 1975 ); cf. Koldewey ( 1890 ); Kontes ( 1978 ); Spencer ( 1995 a ) no. 217 , ( 1995 b ) 283 -85 and fig. 5 ). The extent of the ancient city with its acropolis (occupied by a small Genoese castle) and harbour (undated ancient harbour works are visible beside and under modern constructions) is apparent, and scattered finds suggest stages of expansion from Archaic to Heltic. The earliest historical structural remains may be those south of the Kastro, where an Archaic street and housing complex is underlain by earlier structural remains of Geometric and possibly Protogeometric date (Spencer ( 1995 b ) 283 and n. 94 . The no longer visible theatre ( TGR ii. 253 ) under the village school may be C4 in date (Buchholz ( 1975 )); a second theatral building nearby ( bouleuterion or odeion ?) is also said to have once been visible (Dr. Peter Green, pers. comm.). Graves of C6 and C5 have been uncovered to the west and north of the acropolis (Buchholz ( 1975 ) pl. 10 d; Spencer ( 1995 b ); Archontidhou ( 1999 )). The site of the largest Aiolic temple on the island (probably to Apollo) has been known near the village of Napi since the late nineteenth century, but no complete study has yet appeared; it probably dates to C6l (Evangelidis ( 1926 ), ( 1927 ); Koldewey ( 1890 ) pl. 16 ; Betancourt ( 1977 ); Spencer ( 1995 a ) no. 111 , ( 1995 b ) 299 -300 ). A smaller structure of similar date beside it has not been identified, but it is probably a second temple (the same refs. as above). Recent new excavations ( 1999 ) by the Archaeological Service may reveal more precise information once they have been published. There is also possible evidence for an Archaic silver mine in its south-eastern territory near the village of Argenna (Davies ( 1932 ) 985 ).At various places in the modern town are remains of a C6 (?) polygonal city wall (Koldewey ( 1890 ) pl. 16 , table 4 ab; Lang ( 1996 ) 247 ).As reconstructed by Koldewey,the area enclosed by the walls measured c. 30 ha. Furthermore, it appears from Thuc. 3 . 18 . 1 that Methymna was walled in 428 / 7 and that the fortifications were reinforced in that year; a siege of the city in 406 is reported at Diod. 13 . 76 . 5 . Methymna struck coins of electrum and silver from c. 550 until c. 375 . ( 1 ) Electrum, c. 550 -375 : hektai on the Phokaic standard. Types usually connected with Methymna are: obv . boar or, perhaps, Gorgoneion; rev . lion's head. ( 2 ) Silver, from before 500 to c. 450 : denominations: didrachm, tetrobol, diobol. Types: obv . mostly boar or Gorgoneion; rev . mostly head of Athena; legend: on some ΜΑΘΥΜΝΑΙΟΣ . ( 3 ) Silver, c. 420 -c. 375 . Denominations: didrachm, drachm, triobol, obol. Types: obv . head of Athena; rev . lion's head, or lyre, or kantharos; legend: ΜΑΘΥΜΝΑΙΟΝ , often abbreviated ΜΑ or ΜΑΘ (Head, HN ² 558 , 560 -61 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) 39 ; SNG Cop. Lesbos 345 -51 ). Methymna colonised Assos (no. 769 ) (Myrsilos ( FGrHist 477 ) fr. 17 = Strabo 13 . 1 . 58 )."
798,Mytilene (Mytilenaios),Lesbos,39.05,26.35,4941,24610,"79 8. Mytilene (Mytilenaios) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 05 , long. 26 . 35 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The epichoric form of the toponym is Μυτιλήνα , αasper ( IG xii . 2 1 . 7 (C5s)). In the Attic-Ionic dialect it is Μυτιλήνη , ηasper (Hdt. 1 . 160 . 1 ; Ar. Eq . 834 ; Ant. 5 . 20 ), later Μιτυλήνη ( Syll . ³ 344 . 30 (C4l)). The toponym usually denotes the town (Ant. 5 . 23 ; Thuc. 3 . 18 . 4 ; Ps.-Skylax 97 ), but sometimes the town plus its hinterland ( SEG 36750 . 17 (C4s)) and sometimes the political community (Hdt. 5 . 11 . 2 ; Dem. 40 . 37 ). The city-ethnic is Μυτιληναtildeος (coins and IG xii . 2 1 . 18 , 12 . 3 ) or Μυτιληναῖος ( IG xii . 2 3 . 2 (C4 ?); IG ii² 40 . 19 ( 378 / 7 )). Mytilene is called a polis in the urban sense ( IG xii . 2 4 . 7 , 17 + suppl. p. 2 (C4m); Thuc. 3 . 3 . 3 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 6 . 19 ), in the political sense (Alc. fr. 348 ; IG xii . 2 95 . 3 (C4 ) = SEG 28 690 ; Ant. 5 . 77 ; Thuc. 3 . 13 . 7 ; Dem. 40 . 37 ) and in the territorial sense (Ant. 5 . 76 ; IG xii . 2 6 passim ; SEG 36 750 . 2 -3 , 15 , 19 (C4s)). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and in inscriptions ( IG xii . 2 4 . 5 (C4m); SEG 36 750 . 9 (C4s)) and externally in inscriptions ( IG ii² 213 . 7 ( 347 / 6 ); F.Delphes iii . 4 400 . 3 (C4l/C3e)) and in literary sources (Ant. 5 . 76 ; Thuc. 3 . 2 . 3 ; Arist. Pol . 1285 a 35 ). For the individual and external use, see Πιττακοgraveς οasper Μυτιληναῖος at Pl. Prt . 343 A and ' Ηραιευgraveς Μυτιληναῖος in a C4s healing inscription from Epidauros ( IG iv² . 1 121 . 122 ). Patris is found in Antiph. 5 . 62 and 79 . The territory of Mytilene may have covered c. 450 -500 km ² (Kontes ( 1978 ) figs. 19 -22 ). T o the north it bordered on Methymna, and the frontier may have been as far north as Cape Tsakmák (Mason ( 1993 ) 231 -48 ). According to Labarre ( 1996 ) 194 ), it ran south of Aigeiros, but see supra regarding the problems in identification of this site. To the west Mytilene bordered on Pyrrha and was separated from this polis by the 'pine-covered Pyrrhaian mountain' (Theophr. Hist . pl . 3 . 9 . 5 ) on the slopes of Mt. Olympos. There is no evidence of ancient settlements in this large area, and the forest may have been a no man's land separating Mytilene from Pyrrha (Spencer ( 1996 )). The presumption is that the region east and south of the forest belonged to Mytilene. By the Classical period, it appears that Mytilene's territory was not fertile enough to feed its population, and imports from Bosporos are attested in 428 (Thuc. 3 . 2 . 2 ). In C4m Leukon of Bosporos granted Mytilene a reduction in export duty. As restored, the inscription implies that the Mytilenaians' annual import exceeded 100 , 000 medimnoi ( IG xii suppl. 3 = Tod 163 (C4m)), enough to feed a population of c. 20 , 000 persons. Mytilene was the greatest of the Aiolian poleis , and in the Archaic period had significant involvement in events outside the island. In this respect it appears largely set apart from the other Lesbian poleis , and Mytilene's focus beyond events in the island may well have exacerbated its infamous social stasis at this time (Spencer ( 2000 ) and infra ). In the C7s Mytilene acquired a peraia in the Troas, with Sigeion and Achilleion as the two most prominent centres. C. 620 , however, Athenian settlers under Phrynon took Sigeion. In the following war between Mytilene and Athens, the Mytilenaians were defeated in a battle in which the poet Alkaios lost his shield,but they then regained Sigeion,allegedly after a duel that Pittakos won against Phrynon. The war ended with an arbitration by Periander, the tyrant of Corinth, whereby the Athenians were awarded Sigeion. They probably lost it again, since, in the end, it was Peisistratos who seized Sigeion from Mytilene (Strabo 13 . 2 . 38 ; Hdt. 5 . 94 -95 , where Hdt. has mixed up and misdated some of the events; cf. Schachermeyr ( 1950 ) 1867 -68 ). In the same period the Mytilenaians, as the only Aiolians, were co-colonisers of Naukratis in the reign of Amasis (Hdt. 2 . 178 . 2 ; see Spencer ( 2000 ) 75 -76 ). At some point in C6s Mytilene came under Persian rule, and Mytilenaian ships served in Kambyses' fleet when he invaded Egypt in 525 (Hdt. 3 . 13 -14 ). Mytilene took part in the Ionian Revolt in 499 (Hdt. 6 . 5 . 2 ) and must have provided the majority of the seventy Lesbian ships which fought at Lade in 494 (Hdt. 6 . 8 . 2 ). After the defeat, the entire island of Lesbos was systematically ravaged by the Persians (Hdt. 6 . 31 . 1 ). The Mytilenaians must have fought on the Persian side in 480 / 79 (Hdt. 8 . 85 ), but Lesbos joined the Greeks in 479 (Hdt. 9 . 106 . 4 ). The Mytilenaians were members of the Delian League. The Lesbians were among those who in 478 encouraged the Athenians to replace Sparta as the hegemon in the war against Persia, and the Mytilenaians were among the original members of the League (Thuc. 3 . 10 . 2 -4 ; Plut. Arist . 23 . 4 ). They remained autonomoi and eleutheroi until their revolt in 428 , and instead of paying phoros , they took part in the campaigns with their armed forces (Thuc. 3 . 10 . 5 , 11 . 1 , 3 , 39 . 2 ; Arist. Ath . Pol . 24 . 2 ). The Lesbians, including Mytilene, provided ships against Samos in 440 / 39 (Thuc. 1 . 116 . 2 , 117 . 2 ; Diod. 12 . 27 . 4 , 28 . 2 ) and against the Lakedaimonians and their allies during the first years of the Peloponnesian War (Thuc. 2 . 9 . 5 , 56 . 2 , 3 . 3 . 4 ). Accordingly, they are not recorded in the Athenian tribute lists. In 428 Mytilene and the other Lesbian poleis except Methymna defected from Athens (Thuc. 3 . 2 -18 , 25 , 27 -50 ; Diod. 12 . 55 , derived from Thuc.). Behind the revolt, planned already before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War (Thuc. 3 . 2 . 1 -2 ), was the Mytilenaians'attempt to go through with a synoecism of Lesbos, their success in winning the control of Antissa, Eresos and Pyrrha, and the Athenians' opposition to the synoecism (Thuc. 2 . 3 , 3 . 1 , 5 . 1 , 18 . 1 ; Moggi, Sin . 189 -97 ). The Athenians sent a fleet to Mytilene (Thuc. 3 . 2 ), and after an abortive armistice ( 4 . 4 ) the harbours of Mytilene were blockaded by the Athenian squadron ( 6 . 1 ). At a meeting held in Olympia Mytilenaian envoys obtained an alliance with the Peloponnesian League ( 3 . 8 -15 ). Reinforced by 1 , 000 hoplites, the Athenians built a blockading wall and besieged Mytilene ( 18 . 3 -4 ). A Peloponnesian army invaded Attika in 427 , but the relieving squadron under a Spartan nauarch never reached Mytilene ( 3 . 26 . 1 , 29 -33 ). The Mytilenaians were starved into unconditional surrender ( 3 . 28 . 1 ); and the members of the oligarchic faction were sent to Athens ( 3 . 35 . 1 ). The Athenians decided first to expose Mytilene to an andrapodismos ( 3 . 36 . 2 ), but went back on this decision the following day ( 3 . 49 . 1 ) and concluded peace on the following terms: the oligarchs sent to Athens, over 1 , 000 men, were held responsible for the revolt and executed; the other Mytilenaians were forced to pull down their walls, to surrender their fleet, to cede their possessions in the peraia to Athens, and to have their hinterland divided into 3 , 000 kleroi , of which 300 were made sacred property and 2 , 700 were given to Athenian klerouchs ( 3 . 50 ) (Figueira ( 1991 ) 8 -10 , 251 -53 ). Mytilene became a dependent polis deprived of its hinterland, but not of its urban centre. Thus, there is no basis for Hampl's view (( 1939 ) 1 -2 ) that it became a polis without territory (Hansen ( 1998 ) 55 ). Shortly afterwards, however, perhaps already in 427 / 6 , the Mytilenaians recovered their autonomia ( IG i³ 66 . 12 ) and the possession of their hinterland ( IG i³ 66 . 11 -12 , 18 , 67 . 3 -4 ; Mattingly ( 1996 ) 136 -37 ); but see Hornblower ( 1991 ) 440 -41 ). In 412 Mytilene followed Chios and revolted against Athens once again (Thuc. 8 . 22 . 2 ), but was almost immediately recovered by the Athenians ( 23 . 2 , 100 . 3 ), and it remained loyal to Athens (Diod. 13 . 73 . 5 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 6 . 35 , 38 ) until it was taken by Lysander in 405 (Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 5 ). In 394 the Mytilenaians joined the coalition organised by Konon (Diod. 14 . 84 . 3 ), and with his help they succeeded in 389 in expelling the Lakedaimonians from Eresos and Antissa (Diod. 14 . 94 . 3 -4 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 28 -29 ). Alongside Chios, Rhodos and Byzantion, Mytilene was a founding member of the Second Athenian Naval League. A separate treaty between Athens and Mytilene was concluded in the autumn of 378 ( IG ii² 40 ), and Mytilene is listed among the allies in the so-called Charter of the League ( IG ii² 43 . 80 = Staatsverträge 257 ). The Mytilenaians fought beside the Athenians in the war against the Peloponnesian League ( IG ii² 107 ; Isoc. 14 . 28 ) and approved of an Athenian garrison placed in Mytilene in, probably, 375 ( SEG 19 204 ; Dreher ( 1995 ) 28 ). When Kammys became tyrant of Mytilene in C4m, the city seceded from the League (Dem. 40 . 37 ), but it was readmitted through a new alliance concluded in 347 / 6 ( IG ii² 213 ; Cargill ( 1980 ) 95 ). Mytilene was allied with Alexander the Great (Arr. Anab . 2 . 1 . 4 ; Curt. 4 . 8 . 13 ), but was not necessarily a member of the Corinthian League (Bosworth ( 1980 ) 181 ). The city was besieged and conquered by the Persian fleet in 333 (Diod. 17 . 29 . 2 ; Arr. Anab . 2 . 1 . 2 -4 ), but reconquered by the Makedonians in the following year (Arr. Anab . 3 . 2 . 6 ; Curt. 4 . 5 . 22 ). The constitutional history of Mytilene bristles with revolutions caused by discord between factions ( stasis ) (Gehrke, Stasis 117 -23 ; Spencer ( 2000 )). In C7 the city was ruled by the house of the Penthelidai, described by Aristotle as a βασιλικηgrave δυναστεία ( Pol . 1311 b 26 ), which may indicate that Mytilene originally was a hereditary kingdom (Carlier ( 1984 ) 451 ; Schütrumpf and Gehrke ( 1996 ) 561 ). Because of their tyrannical behaviour, they were overturned by a certain Megakles; but later in the century Mytilene was once again ruled by a member of the family, Penthilos, who was murdered by Smerdes ( Pol . 1311 b 27 -30 ; Alc. fr. 75 ). His sonin-law was Pittakos (Diog. Laert 1 . 81 ; Alc. fr. 70 ), who at some point ruled Mytilene together with Myrsilos (Alc. fr. 70 . 7 ; Strabo 12 . 2 . 3 ). A faction led by Alkaios and his two brothers made an abortive attempt to overthrow Myrsilos, and Alkaios had to go into exile to Pyrrha ( P Berol . 9569 ). Myrsilos died (Alc. fr. 332 ), and after a period of civil war (Alc. fr. 70 . 11 ) Pittakos was elected aisymnetes by the Mytilenaians; according to Alkaios (fr. 348 ), however,he was elected tyrannos (Arist. Pol . 1285 a 35 -b 1 ). Pittakos was later remembered as having given the Mytilenaians new laws ( nomoi ), but not a new constitution ( politeia ) (Arist. Pol . 1274 b 18 -23 ). Under his rule the basileis are attested as a board of officials (Theophr. fr. 650 ). According to Apollodoros (( FGrHist 244 ) fr. 27 ), Pittakos was elected c. 600 and held power for ten years and then resigned his post (Schachermeyr ( 1950 ) 1865 -67 ( stasis ), 1868 -70 ( aisymnetes ), 1870 -72 (chronology)). Thereafter Mytilene was probably an oligarchy, but in c. 512 a new tyrant, Koes, was installed by Dareios as tyrant of Mytilene (Hdt. 5 . 11 ). At the beginning of the Ionian Revolt he was handed over to the Mytilenaian people and stoned to death (Hdt. 5 . 37 -38 ). In 428 Mytilene was an oligarchy (Thuc. 3 . 39 . 6 ), apparently with a ruling class of more than 1 , 000 citizens (Thuc. 3 . 50 . 1 ). One of the factors behind the defection from Athens seems to have been a dispute about succession to property among some of the euporoi (Arist. Pol . 1304 a 4 -10 ), and when the dynatoi issued the demos with hoplite equipment, the commoners opposed the government and forced the surrender (Thuc. 3 . 27 . 3 ; Gillis ( 1971 )). In the years after 405 Mytilene was probably ruled by a Spartan harmost and a Board of Ten (Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 5 ; Paus. 8 . 52 . 4 ), but in 390 / 89 , when they and their Mytilenaian supporters were expelled (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 28 -29 ), Mytilene seems to have become a democracy ( IG xii . 2 4 . 3 (C4m), see infra ; IG ii² 107 ; Gehrke, Stasis 121 ). By 353 / 2 , however, the democracy had been abolished (Dem. 13 . 8 ) and replaced with an oligarchy (Dem. 15 . 19 ; Isoc. Ep . 8 ). Shortly afterwards Mytilene was ruled by a tyrant, Kammys (Dem. 40 . 37 ; Brun ( 1988 ) 381 -82 ), but he was already deposed in 347 / 6 ( IG ii² 213 ). When the Persians had conquered Mytilene in 333 , one of the exiles, Diogenes, was set up as tyrant of Mytilene (Arr. Anab . 2 . 1 . 5 ), but in the following year democracy was restored and a group of exiles readmitted to Mytilene ( SEG 36 750 . 3 : δα µ οκρατίαι ; SEG 36 752 = IG xii . 2 6 ; cf. Heisserer ( 1980 ) 118 -41 ; SEG 40 673 ). Under democracy decrees ( ψαφίσ µ ατα ) were passed by the council ( βόλλα ) and the people ( δαtilde µ ος ) in accordance with a probouleumatic procedure ( IG xii . 2 5 + suppl.; SEG 36 750 , 752 ; cf. Rhodes, DGS 256 -58 ). The eponymous official was a prytanis ( SEG 36 750 . 18 ; Theophr. fr. 650 ), and a prytaneion is mentioned in a paraphrase of Sappho's poems (Ath. 425 A); cf. πρυτανεῖον at P Oxy . 3711 . fr. 1 . col. 1 . 4 , a late commentary on Alkaios. Other magistrates were boards of kings ( βασίληες ), generals ( στρόταγοι ) and some called περίδρο µ οι and δικάσκοποι ( IG xii . 2 6 . 6 -14 ). A treasurer ( τα µ ίας ) is also attested ( IG xii . 2 5 . 17 ), and we know from Ant. 5 . 77 that some of the public expenditure was defrayed through liturgies. The Mytilenaians sent envoys to Olympia (Thuc. 3 . 9 -14 ) and to Athens ( IG ii² 107 . 21 -22 ) and received envoys from Athens ( IG ii² 107 . 31 -34 ). Mytilene granted proxenia to citizens of Magnesia on the Maeander ( SEG 26 909 (C4l)) and to a citizen of an unknown polis ( IG xii . 2 5 . 5 + suppl. (C4s)). Mytilenaian citizens received proxenia from Athens (Dem. 40 . 36 ; Arist. Pol . 1304 a 9 -10 ) and Delphi ( F.Delphes iii . 4 400 (C4l/C3e)). Apart from one Olympic victor in 476 ( P Oxy . 222 . i . 7 ; Olympionikai 209 ), the only known Mytilenaian victor in Panhellenic games was a periodonike who was active c. 300 and, thus, is too late for our investigation ( IvO 173 ; Paus. 6 . 15 . 1 ). The city occupied an offshore island and the adjacent mainland from C10 , probably focused around what later became known as the city's 'North Harbour'at Epano Skala (Spencer ( 1995 a ) no. 27 , ( 1995 b ) fig. 3 a); settlement activity of the third millennium has been found on the Classical acropolis of Mytilene (Lambrianides and Spencer ( 1997 ) 86 -87 and fig. 5 ), and another settlement of the same date has been found on the coast just south of the Classical city. Sporadic Mycenaean sherds have been reported in the area of the modern town, where there are also finds of the Protogeometric, Geometric and Archaic periods (Spencer ( 1995 b ) 279 -81 and fig. 3 , ( 2000 ) 74 -75 fig. 4 . 5 ). However, most of the surviving ancient remains are Heltic and later. Unpublished excavations in the early 1980 s have revealed at least one of the stone bridges over the intervening channel (silted up in mediaeval times) mentioned by Longus ( Daphnis and Chloe 1 ); it is probably Roman in date. According to Vitruvius ( 1 . 6 . 1 ), the town was laid out on a grid plan, but poorly orientated to the prevailing winds; some evidence of the orthogonal plan survives in the alignment of various structures excavated throughout the city. Archaeological excavations began in a modest way in the late nineteenth century with the work of Robert Koldewey and his colleagues at Mytilene and elsewhere on the island (Koldewey ( 1890 )), but apart from the theatre, whose date is uncertain, large-scale work did not begin until the 1960 s, and even then involved mostly salvage excavations, rarely published in any detail and only occasionally touching on Archaic and Classical levels. Later Roman, mediaeval and Ottoman buildings destroyed or covered most earlier remains and only occasionally is a 'window' possible back to the city's early history. Several Greek publications summarise much of what was known about Mytilene up to the early 1970 s (Kontes ( 1973 ), ( 1978 )); for a complete collection of all relevant references, see Spencer ( 1995 b ) no. 27 ), and recent excavations by the Canadian Archaeological Institute at Athens and K' Ephoreia of the Greek Archaeological Service have added substantially to our knowledge of certain areas (H. Williams ( 1984 ); Williams and Williams ( 1985 ), ( 1986 ), ( 1987 ), ( 1988 ), ( 1989 ), ( 1990 ), ( 1991 ); Archontidhou ( 1986 -95 )). Possibly Archaic, certainly Classical and Late Classical sections of fortifications have been uncovered in different areas of the city, especially on the north-western side where they are still well preserved and seem to be of late Lesbianstyle masonry (Koldewey ( 1890 ) pls. 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 ; Kontes ( 1978 ) figs. 35 , 39 ; Mason ( 2001 )). It is probable that the city expanded from its original focus around the north harbour further west on to the mainland in C5 , perhaps just before the revolt of 428 (Diod. 13 . 79 ; Thuc. 3 . 2 . 1 ). A relatively wellpreserved stretch some 50 m long was uncovered near the north harbour and seems to date from C4m; it probably defended the island portion of the city (Williams and Williams ( 1991 ) 180 fig. 2 ). Some 100 m to the north-west, excavations in 1999 -2000 uncovered an apparently matching wall defending the mainland side of the city east of the modern IKA building.A 33 m stretch of probably C4fortification wall was uncovered in 1973 near the public swimming pool at the edge of the modern south harbour (Khatzi ( 1973 ) 509 -10 ). Smaller sections of city walls have been found, mostly on the north and south sides of town, in various salvage excavations, and seem to be late Classical in date. According to Koldewey ( 1890 ) pls. 11 -12 the walls enclosed an area of 140 ha. In connection with the revolt in 428 Thucydides reports that walls were being constructed ( 3 . 2 . 2 , 5 ). The city was besieged by the Athenians in 428 ( 3 . 18 . 4 -5 ), and the walls were demolished after the conquest in 427 ( 3 . 50 . 1 ); however, walls are attested in 406 by Xen. Hell . 1 . 6 . 17 ( τεῖχος ) and in 333 by Diod. 17 . 29 . 2 . Mytilene had two harbours (Thuc. 3 . 6 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 97 ; Strabo 13 . 2 . 2 ). Strabo says that the south harbour of the city housed Mytilene's triremes, but the modern harbour works have obliterated any remains; the east and west moles of the commercial north harbour ( supra ), however, survive just below modern sea level. Probably Roman in their present form, they may well go back to at least the Classical period, and as noted above, this harbour appears to have been the focus of the earliest post-prehistoric settlement. Immediately adjacent to the south side of the north harbour are the remains of a long substantial stoa of C4 or C3 , known since the 1920 s but not completely excavated until 2000 -1 (Coulton ( 1977 )). A long stretch of a well-built C4 aqueduct has also been uncovered (Khatzi ( 1972 ), ( 1973 )) on the south side of town. The theatre ( TGR ii. 252 ) on the sloping hillsides to the west of the town has been excavated on several occasions,but only brief preliminary reports have appeared; it is probably late Classical or early Heltic in date (Evangelidis ( 1927 ); cf. Plut. Pomp . 42 . 9 (rC4m)). Remains of at least three Archaic/Late Classical sanctuaries have been found in different areas of the city. A C7sanctuary,possibly to Kybele (a crude small statue of the goddess appeared in the excavations along with much Archaic bucchero), with an apsidal building in Lesbian-style masonry appeared during building operations behind the former insane asylum near the north harbour; it has been published only in a brief preliminary form (Khatzi ( 1973 ) 515 -17 fig. 10 ; Spencer ( 1995 b ) 296 -99 fig. 11 ). A Late Classical/Heltic sanctuary to Demeter and Kore and Kybele has been excavated on the acropolis inside the mediaeval castle; it consisted of a series of at least five altars in a row north-south with a rectangular two-room building behind and two semicircular ashpits for burned remains of piglets (Williams and Williams ( 1991 )). A sanctuary to Aphrodite was uncovered during building operations on the south slopes of the acropolis (Archontidhou ( 1986 -95 )) and there is some evidence for a sanctuary of Asklepios near the west side of the south harbour (Khatzio). The sanctuary of Apollo Maloies near the north harbour is still elusive (Thuc. 3 . 3 . 3 ). For a general account of local cults based mostly on literary and epigraphic evidence, see Shields ( 1917 ). A cult of Zeus Homonoios and Homonoia was invoked in connection with the restoration of the democracy in 332 ( SEG 36 750 . 7 -8 ; cf. Thériault ( 1996 ) 19 -29 ). Cults of the Twelve Gods,of Zeus Basileus and Zeus Heraios were also invoked. At least some C6 graves seem to have been found in what became the expanded C5 city (Kontes ( 1978 ) 216 ; Spencer ( 1995 b ) 295 ). Extensive late Classical/early Heltic cemeteries have been found north and south of the city, although there have only been short preliminary publications of them to date. Graves varied from simple interments cut in the bedrock to tile-covered, to stone-lined cists, to limestone sarcophagi,some in funerary precincts surrounded by a wall (Khatzi ( 1972 ), ( 1973 ); Spencer ( 1995 b ); autopsy on highway north of Mytilene in 2001 ). Mytilene struck coins of electrum, silver, billon and bronze from C5f on. ( 1 ) Electrum, C5f/C4s: hektai on the Phokaic standard, with a great variety of types: obv . ram's head, or lion's head, or Apollo laureate, or young Dionysos, etc.; rev . panther, or sphinx, or Persephone, etc., all in incuse square; legend (on one coin only): ΜΥΤΙ . In C5s Phokaia and Mytilene concluded a treaty that the two poleis should take turns and strike identical electrum coins in alternating years ( IG xii . 2 1 = SEG 34 849 ). ( 2 ) Billon, c. 480 -450 , on the Phoenician and Persic standard: denominations: fractions of stater down to a twenty-fourth, with a variety of types: obv . head of calf, or lion, or Negro, etc.; rev . incuse square, sometimes with eye,or amphora,etc.;legend:on a few ΛΕΣ or Μ or ΜΥ . ( 3 ) Silver, C5f/C4s: denominations: stater, drachm,hemidrachm,diobol,trihemiobol,obol;types: obv . head of Apollo or of Nymph Mytilene; rev . various types: head of nymph Mytilene,or goat's head, or lyre, etc.; legend: ΜΥΤΙ , once ΜΥΤΙΛΕΝΑΩΝ . ( 4 ) Bronze,C4 : types: obv . Apollo laureate; rev . bull's head; legend: ΜΥ or ΜΥΤΙ (Head, HN ² 558 -59 , 561 -62 ; Bodenstedt ( 1973 ); SNG Cop. Lesbos 284 -99 (billon), 300 -30 (electrum), 364 -69 (silver), 370 -74 (bronze)). Mytilene colonised Achilleion in Troas (no. 766 ) (Strabo 13 . 1 . 39 ), Sigeion in Troas (no. 791 ) (Hdt. 5 . 94 . 1 ), Ainos in Thrace (no. 641 ) (Ephor. fr. 39 ), and Hermonassa in the Pontic region (no. 697 ) (Arr. Bith . fr. 55 = ( FGrHist 156 ) fr. 71 ). In addition to its hinterland, Mytilene possessed a sizeable peraia in Troas and northern Aiolis (Strabo 13 . 1 . 38 ; Livy 37 . 21 . 4 ), although at what date all parts of this peraia were acquired, and whether all were simultaneously held, is not clear. The terminus ante quem for Mytilene's acquisition of at least part of its peraia is the dispute between Mytilene and Athens over Sigeion in C7l-C6e (Hdt. 5 . 95 . 2 ; Strabo 13 . 1 . 38 ; Diog. Laert. 1 . 74 ). The precise extent of the peraia is unknown,but it included the so-called Aktaiai poleis (Thuc. 4 . 52 . 2 -3 ): i.e. Achilleion (no. 766 ), Antandros (no. 767 ), Hamaxitos (no. 778 ), Larisa (no. 784 ), Ophryneion (no. 786 ), Ilion (no. 779 ), Pordoselene (no. 831 ), Rhoiteion (no. 790 ), plus some others ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 122 -40 , 77 . iv . 14 -27 ; see Hansen ( 1997 ) 32 ). Mytilene had to surrender its peraia to Athens in 427 (Thuc. 3 . 50 . 3 ). Some of the Aktaiai poleis were reconquered in 424 by exiled Mytilenaians (Thuc. 4 . 52 . 3 ), but at least Antandros was lost again soon after (Thuc. 4 . 75 . 1 ). By C4m Mytilene had recovered part of its peraia in the Gulf of Adramytteion (Ps.-Skylax 98 ), and had it extended by a gift from Alexander in 331 (Curt. 4 . 8 . 13 ). For the extent of the peraia , see Kontes ( 1978 ) figs. 18 ff; Stauber ( 1996 ) 163 -65 )."
799,Pyrrha (Pyrrhaios),Lesbos,39.1,26.15,1009,4888,"799 . Pyrrha (Pyrrhaios) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 10 , long. 26 . 15 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: A. The toponym is Πυacuteρρα , ηasper (Thuc. 3 . 35 . 1 ; Theophr. Hist. pl . 2 . 2 . 5 ). The city-ethnic is Πυρραῖος ( IG ii² 107 . 29 ( 368 / 7 ); Arist. Hist. an . 548 a 10 ; Theophr. Hist. pl . 3 . 9 . 5 ). Pyrrha is called a polis in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 97 (cf. Hdt. 1 . 151 . 2 ), and at Thuc. 3 . 18 . 1 polis is used about Pyrrha in the urban and political senses simultaneously. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ) and externally in inscriptions ( IG ii² 107 . 29 ( 368 / 7 )) and in literature (Arist. Hist. an . 548 a 10 ). The individual and external use is attested in a Delphic proxeny decree for Μενέδη µ ος Ευνίκου Πυρραῖος ( BCH ( 1940 / 1 ) 94 . 4 ( 330 / 29 )). Pyrrha is implicitly called patris in Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 28 . The territory of Pyrrha seems to have comprised the south coast of the Gulf of Kalloni, in the sources called οasper Πυρραῖος ευacuteριπος (Arist. Part . an . 680 a 36 - b 1 ) as well as the region south of the Gulf. It may have covered c. 250 km ² (Kontes ( 1978 ) figs. 19 -22 ). Pyrrha bordered on Methymna to the north, near Messon. To the east Pyrrha bordered on Mytilene and was separated from this polis by the 'pinecovered Pyrrhaian mountain' (Theophr. Hist . pl. 3 . 9 . 5 ) on the slopes of Mt. Olympos (see no. 798 supra ). The only thing we learn about the history of Pyrrha in the Archaic period is that Alkaios found shelter in the city when he had been exiled from Mytilene ( P Berol . 9569 ). The Pyrrhaians were members of the Delian League. They are unattested in the Athenian tribute lists, which shows that, like the other Lesbian poleis , the Pyrrhaians provided ships instead of paying phoros (Thuc. 1 . 116 . 2 , 117 . 2 ). In 428 they joined the Mytilenaians in defecting from Athens (Thuc. 3 . 2 . 1 , 25 . 1 ). They were involved in the Mytilenaian attempt to synoecise Lesbos, and before the Athenian siege of Mytilene began, the Mytilenaians secured their position in Antissa,Pyrrha and Eresos and reinforced the fortifications of the three cities ( 3 . 18 . 1 ). The Athenians gained possession of Pyrrha and Eresos only after Mytilene's surrender in 427 ( 3 . 35 . 1 ), and the territory, or at least a part of it, was surrendered to Athenian klerouchs ( 3 . 50 . 2 ). In 412 Pyrrha followed Chios and Mytilene and seceded from Athens once again (Thuc. 8 . 23 . 2 ). It was recovered by Athens soon after ( 8 . 23 . 6 ), but Pyrrha was allied with Sparta once again in 406 (Diod. 13 . 100 . 5 ). In C4e Pyrrha was allied with Lakedaimon, but in 390 / 89 Thrasyboulos seems to have forced the city to join the Athenians (Diod. 14 . 94 . 3 -4 ; Lys. fr. 119 , Sauppe). The settlement undoubtedly included the repatriation of some exiles to Mytilene (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 28 ). Pyrrha was a member of the Second Athenian Naval League. In the list of members appended to the so-called Charter of the League, Pyrrha is restored either in line 90 : Π [ υρραῖοι ] or in B 1 : [ Πυρ ] ραίων [ οasper δ ] ηtilde µ ος (Dreher ( 1995 ) 198 n. 105 ; cf. SEG 38 55 ). In any case, Pyrrha joined the League after Mytilene and Methymna ( 80 -81 ), but before Antissa and Eresos (B. 20 -21 ). Pyrrhaian representatives in the allied synedrion are attested for the year 368 / 7 ( IG ii² 107 . 29 ). In C4f Menedemos of Pyrrha, a member of Plato's Academy (Philoch. fr. 224 ; Epikrates fr. 10 , PCG ), was sent back to his mother city to advise the Pyrrhaians about their constitution (Plut. Mor . 1126 C). In 330 / 29 he became proxenos of Delphi ( BCH ( 1940 / 1 ) 94 . 4 ). In 333 Pyrrha was taken by the Persian admiral Memnon alongside the other Lesbian poleis (Diod. 17 . 29 . 2 ; Arr. Anab . 2 . 1 . 1 ), but by a peaceful agreement the Makedonians regained the small cities on Lesbos in the following year (Arr. Anab . 3 . 2 . 6 ). The acropolis and possibly the lower town exhibit traces of settlement, fortification walls and tombs dating from the end of C10 (Koldewey ( 1890 ) pl. 11 ; Kontes ( 1978 ) fig. 60 ; Paraskevaidis ( 1963 ); Spencer ( 1995 a ) no. 99 , ( 1995 b ) 281 -83 , fig. 4 ). As reconstructed by Koldewey ( 1890 ) 7 -28 and pl. 11 , the walls enclosed an area of 9 . 5 ha. Small-scale excavations nearly a hundred years ago carried out by Bohlau at Pyrrha uncovered a C8 apsidal building, probably a sanctuary (Schiering ( 1989 )), and salvage excavations have opened numerous late Classical/Heltic graves (Kontes ( 1973 ); Archontidhou ( 1999 ) 74 -75 for finds); rising sea levels have covered some buildings by the shore,including several identified as ship sheds of unknown date.

800,Adramyttion (Adramytenos),Aiolis and South-western Mysia,39.3,26.55,742,3790,"800 . Adramyttion (Adramytenos) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 30 , long. 26 . 55 . Size of territory: ? Type A: β . The toponym is Αδρα µ υacuteττ ( ε ) ιον , τό (Hdt. 7 . 42 . 1 ; Xen. An . 7 . 8 . 8 ; Kratinos fr. 508 , PCG ) or Ατρα µ υacuteττιον , τό (Thuc. 5 . 1 . 1 , 8 . 108 . 4 ). The city-ethnic is Αδρα µ υτηνός ( IG ii² 7941 (C3 )) or, once, Αδρα µ ου [ ττανόν ] ( IG vii 2860 (C4l); cf. Fossey ( 1994 ) 37 ). Adramyttion is called a polis in the urban sense by Herodotos 7 . 42 . 1 , and Ps.-Skylax 98 mentions Adramyttion under the heading πόλεις . . . ' Ελληνίδες αιasperacuteδε . That it was a polis in the political sense too is indicated by Aristotle's inclusion of Adramyttion in his collection of politeiai (Arist. fr. 473 ). The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested on Heltic coins, in abbreviated forms on coins of the Classical period ( infra ). The external and individual use is attested in a federal proxenia decree of Boiotia, presumably passed in C4 ( IG vii 2860 ). Adramyttion probably was not a member of the Delian League:the restoration Α [ τρα µ υτ ] ενοί in IG i² 192 . iii . 13 has been rejected in IG i³ 260 . iv . 16 , where the editor now reads Α [ ρισβαῖοι ]. According to Thucydides 5 . 1 . 1 and 8 . 108 . 4 , Persia retained firm control of Adramyttion in C5 : Pharnakes, the satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, allowed refugees from Delos, who had been driven out by the Athenians in 422 , to settle at Adramyttion, where they seem to have remained until they were allowed to return home in 421 / 0 (Thuc. 5 . 32 . 1 ). Perhaps some of them stayed on: if the massacre of the Delians in Adramyttion by Arsakes (Thuc. 8 . 108 . 4 ) is to be placed in 411 , as proposed e.g. by Stauber ( 1996 a ) i. 133 , this might suggest Delian settlement of a more permanent nature. On the problems related to Arsakes' murder of some of the Delians and Arsakes' connections with Tissaphernes and Pharnakes, see Gomme et al . ( 1981 ) 356 -57 , who follow the conventional view that the massacre took place c. 421 , and Hornblower ( 1996 ) 423 -24 . Presumably the polis remained under Persian control during most of C4 as well, although in Ps.-Skylax 98 it is described as a polis Hel and the region as being under Lesbos, perhaps in the period 404 -386 . It is conceivable that one of the Lesbian poleis , which had control of significant territory on the mainland, may also have controlled Adramyttion as a dependent polis . The first epigraphical attestation of Adramyttion's relations with the rest of the Greek world is IG vii 2860 (C4 ), bestowing proxenia and other privileges on the Adramyttian honorand. However, a number of jugs 'from Adramyttion' are recorded in a Delian inventory of 364 / 3 ( I.Delos 104 . 12 ). Silver and bronze coins were struck in Adramyttion by Orontas c. 357 -352 or perhaps in 362 / 1 in connection with the satrap's revolt (Troxell ( 1981 ); contra Moysey ( 1989 )). For the 'autonomous bronze coinage'struck in C4f with the legend of Adramyttion, see the catalogue in Stauber ( 1996 a ) ii. 193 -96 nos. 11 -26 . Types: obv . head of Zeus; rev . forepart of winged horse; legend: Α∆ΡΑ or Α∆ΡΑΜΥ . The full form of the ethnic ( Α∆ΡΑΜΥΤΗΝΩΝ ) is attested on coins of C2 and later: ibid. nos. 27 ff. As for the ethnic composition of the population of Adramyttion, the polis must have been sufficiently Heled in C4s to merit inclusion in Aristotle's collection of politeiai , but it may well have contained an ethnically mixed citizen body throughout the Classical period and even later. Later tradition largely agrees in regarding Adramyttion as a Lydian foundation. Aristotle (fr. 473 , Gigon) claims that the polis was founded by Adramytos, the son of Alyattes and brother of Kroisos. Rival traditions are all later."
801,Aigai(ai) (Aigaieus),Aiolis and South-western Mysia,38.5,27.1,605,3154,"801 . Aigai(ai) (Aigaieus) Map 56 . Lat. 38 . 50 , long. 27 . 10 . Size of territory: ? Type A: α . The toponym is Αιγαῖαι (Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 ), Αιγαί , αιasper (Ps.-Skylax 98 ; Strabo 13 . 3 . 5 ) or Αιγαιεῖς (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 5 , probably corrupt). The city-ethnic is Αιγαευacuteς (Michel 13 . 11 (C4l); Head, HN ² 552 (C3 )) or Αιγαιευacuteς (Head, HN ² 552 (C3 ); Polyb. 5 . 77 . 4 ). Suda Σ 1898 notes the form Αιγιευacuteς . As part of the original Aiolian dodekapolis Aigaiai is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 , with the territorial sense as a possible connotation, and in the political sense at Hdt. 1 . 150 . 2 and in a C4 inscription (Malay ( 1994 ) no. 515 B l. 2 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in Staatsverträge 456 . 12 (C4l-C3 ). The earliest external attestations are Heltic (collective use: Polyb. 5 . 77 . 4 ; individual use: SEG 32 1322 (C3 ), Cyprus; IG xi . 4 1042 (C3 ), Delos). Little is known about the extent of Aigai's territory in the Archaic and Classical periods. However, a C4l treaty between Aigai and the community of the Olympenoi ( Staatsverträge 456 ) was set up at a small ancient settlement near Yenice Köy,located c. 5 km north-west of the urban centre of Aigai. Reinach ( 1891 ) 272 inferred from the inscription that the village was dependent on Aigai; but more evidence is needed to corroborate Reinach's interpretation. Herodotos lists Aigai among the twelve original Aiolian poleis in 1 . 149 . 1 , and Malay ( 1994 ) no. 515 is indeed written in the Aiolic dialect. The polis was not a member of the Delian League,and it may be assumed that the Persians maintained at least nominal control over the polis during C5 and C4 . However, according to Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 5 , in 394 Derkylidas claimed, presumably exaggerating, that even in Asia Minor itself there were poleis such as Temnos and Aigai where it would be possible to live without being subjected ( υasperπήκοοι ) to the Persian king. Only one Aigaian treaty survives from the Classical period, viz . Staatsverträge 456 , concluded between Aigai and the Olympenoi regulating the seasonal transhumance of flocks. Malay ( 1994 ) no. 515 is a public enactment ( ψάφι µµ α ), which mentions officials ( αρχαί , A. 3 ) and a priest ( ιasperερευacuteς , A. 5 ). Bohn and Schuchhardt ( 1889 ) describe the visible remains of the urban centre of Aigai, which had been completely rebuilt after an earthquake in ad 17 . Of older remains, only the inner city wall may be pre-Heltic (ibid. 10 ), and a second, larger, city wall may be dated with reasonable certainty to the reign of Eumenes II. The preHeltic wall is constructed in rough polygonal masonry and had a circumference of no more than 1 km,enclosing an area of triangular shape (ibid. 8 -9 ), and this points to an urban centre of a modest size. Radt ( 1991 ) discusses remains of monumental architecture and argues in favour of connecting a C6 Aiolian capital with the site of Aigai. The earliest coinage of Aigai dates from C3 (Head, HN ² 552 ), although Head ( 1875 ) 293 tentatively assigned a number of electrum coins from 600 -550 to Aigai."

The polis is attested only in Herodotos, who lists it as one of the twelve original Aiolian poleis . It is called a polis in the urban sense at 1 . 149 . 1 , with the territorial sense as a possible connotation, and in the political sense at 1 . 150 . 2 . It has been suggested by Stein ( 1883 ) 173 n. 3 that Aigiroessa is an earlier name of Elaia, which is not mentioned by Herodotos in his listing of Aiolian poleis . However,coins from Elaia with the legend ΕΛΑΙ are attested as far back as C5m (Head, HN ² 554 ). Cook ( 1958 -59 ) 4 , 17 attempts to locate Aigiroessa at the site of Belkahve in Smyrnaian territory."

The toponym is Αταρνευacuteς , οasper (Hdt. 6 . 28 . 2 , 8 . 106 . 1 ; Arist. Pol . 1267 a 32 ; Isoc. 4 . 144 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 11 ; Theopomp. fr. 291 ; Tod 165 . 32 = I.Erythrai u. Klazomenai 9 (C4m)).The city-ethnic is Αταρν ( ε ) ίτης (Hdt. 6 . 4 . 1 ; IG xii suppl. 142 . 117 (C2m); Callim. Epigr . 1 . 1 ; Strabo 13 . 1 . 60 ; Paus. 7 . 2 . 11 ). Atarneus is called polis in the urban sense in Ps.-Skylax 98 . That it was a polis in the political sense too may, up to a point, be inferred from the treaty between Hermias of Atarneus and Erythrai of C4m ( infra ). The legend ΑΤΑΡ on C4 coins is presumably the collective and internal use of the city-ethnic ( infra ). The external use of the cityethnic is attested collectively in IG xii suppl. 142 . 117 (C2m) and individually in Hdt. 6 . 4 . 1 and Callim. Epigr . 1 . 1 . The territory is called Αταρνείτις χώρη (Hdt. 6 . 29 . 1 ) and comprised the location Malene (for the problems related to the identification of Malene, see Stauber ( 1996 a ) i. 241 -42 ). According to Hdt. 1 . 160 . 4 , the Chians gained possession of Atarneus in return for handing over Paktyes to Kyros in 547 / 6 ; see also Hdt. 8 . 106 . 1 , who refers to Atarneus as in 'Mysian territory' and occupied by Chians. However, Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 11 describes Atarneus as occupied by refugees from Chios, which may indicate that at that time it had turned into some kind of splinter community over which the Chians had lost control (compare, e.g., the relationship between Anaia and Samos during the Peloponnesian War). See also Diod. 13 . 65 . 4 , mentioning how exiled Chian democrats used Atarneus as a base for their raids against the island in 409 . Even during the tyranny of Hermias from c. 355 , it is clear that the Chians still maintained some interest in and had a claim to the site (Theopomp. fr. 291 ). Tod 165 may be regarded as a treaty entered into by Atarneus with Erythrai in so far as the treaty concerned Atarneus as a community, if only indirectly, and was to be publicised in the sanctuary of Atarneus (Tod 165 . 32 -33 ). On the other hand,the party to the treaty is Hermias rather than the polis as a whole, and it is significant that the delegates appointed to take the oath on behalf of Hermias and his associates are not referred to as representatives of the polis of Atarneus. Atarneus is described as a city in Mysia (Hdt. 1 . 160 . 4 ; Isoc. 4 . 144 ). The site of Atarneus has been located on Kale Tepe, on which there are substantial remains of C4 buildings and a large preserved section of Atarneus' city wall dating from C5 or C4 (Stauber ( 1996 a ) i. 269 -72 ). The city wall is also attested in Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 11 and Arist. Pol . 1267 a 32 , both of which relate to sieges of Atarneus, in 398 / 7 and c. 350 respectively. The site in Kale Tepe has yielded a considerable amount of surface finds from C4 , pottery as well as tiles (Stauber ( 1996 a ) i. 271 ), which suggests occupation of a relatively high density. A sanctuary ( ιasperεροgraveν τουtilde Αταρνέως ) is designated as a site in which the treaty between Hermias and Erythrai is to be displayed (Tod 165 . 32 ). Atarneus struck coins in silver and bronze from c. 400 onwards: obv . head of Apollo, or head of goddess; rev . coiled snake; legend: ΑΤΑ or ΑΤΑΡ (Stauber ( 1996 a ) ii. 270 -79 , cat. nos. 1 -33 ; SNG Cop. Mysia 21 -27 ). The ethnic composition of the population cannot be determined with certainty. When the Chians 'bought' Atarneus from Kyros in return for handing over the refugee Paktyes (Hdt. 1 . 160 . 4 ), there may have been a non-Greek population already dwelling there, and we do not know if they were expelled by the Chian settlers. But Himerius ( Orat . 40 . 6 -7 = Arist. fr. 675 , Rose) suggests, for what it is worth, that the process of Helation may not have been complete even in Aristotle's day. Himerius, who calls Atarneus a πόλις Μυσῶν , does not indicate the origin of this anecdote."

If the identification of Chalkis with modern Çiplakada is correct, the territory of this community was c. 2 . 5 km ² . Çiplakada belongs to a group of twenty-three islands known as Hekatonnesoi , first mentioned by Herodotos ( 1 . 151 . 2 ), who reports on one Aiolian polis there (no. 823 ). It is very unlikely that he has the settlement at Çiplakada in mind, however: the larger polis Pordoselene/Nasos is a far more plausible candidate. The island has yet to be excavated, but Stauber and his team have reported substantial surface finds that point to a sizeable Heltic-Roman settlement. They also observed a fortification wall, the lower courses of which appear to be quite old (Stauber ( 1996 a ) i. 228 ), and find it highly plausible that the island contained a settlement in the Classical period (C5 /C4 ). Stauber (( 1996 a ) ii. 280 -82 ) ascribes C4 bronze coinage to this community, but with caution. Types: obv . female head r. (Artemis?); rev . spearhead; legend: ΧΑ .

In Ps.Skylax 98 Elaia is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις . . . ' Ελλνηίδες . . . αιasperacuteδε . Elaia is called a polis in the political sense in Plut. Phokion 18 . 7 in a retrospective C4 context, referring to instructions given by Alexander the Great to Krateros to capture the city and hand over control to Phokion, a plan which did not succeed. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on Heltic coins ( SNG Cop.Aeolis 177 ff), in abbreviated forms on coins of the Classical period ( infra ), and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ); the individual use is attested externally in IG xii . 6 23 (C4l). Very little is known about the history of Elaia. Herodotos does not mention it in his list of original Aiolian foundations ( 1 . 149 . 1 ), and the hypothesis that Elaia was originally known as the otherwise unattested Aigiroessa in Herodotos' list is not supported by any available evidence. The alternative explanation offered by Bürchner ( 1905 ), that Elaia was founded as an Athenian colony and therefore was never counted as a member of the Aiolian dodekapolis , rests primarily on the tradition that names Menestheus with his Athenian troops as its founder (Strabo 13 . 3 . 5 ; but note that in 13 . 1 . 67 he refers to Elaia as a polis Aiolike ). Elaia was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded in the tribute lists sometimes by toponym ( IG i³ 266 . i . 17 ), while in other lists the entries are by the collective form of the city-ethnic ( IG i³ 261 . iii . 4 ). It is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . i . 16 , restored) to 421 / 20 ( IG i³ 285 . ii . 8 -9 ) a total of fifteen times, once completely restored,paying in all years a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 261 . iii . 4 ). In C4l, Horismos Damasistratou of Elaia received proxenia and citizenship from Samos after the restoration of the Samians to their island ( IG xii . 6 23 ). The Elaians made a communal dedication of a beardless image of Zeus at Olympia (Paus. 5 . 24 . 6 , who does not give a date). The site was described by Bürchner ( 1905 ). The oldest city wall (probably C3 ) enclosed an area of c. 6 ha. An acropolis was located on the hill Maltepe (Bean ( 1966 ) 112 -14 ). Elaia struck silver coins c. 460 -400 and bronze coins after c. 340 .

The full form of the cityethnic, Γα µ βρειώτης , is not attested earlier than C3l ( Syll . ³ 1219 . 4 = Michel 520 = LSAM 16 ), but the legend ΓΑΜ on the C4 coins is presumably an abbreviated form. Gambrion is called a polis in Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 6 , where polis is used in the urban and political senses combined.It was a town captured by Thibron, but it is also described as a personal fief which had been given by the Persian king to Gongylos of Eretria in C5 , whose descendants were still in control in early C4 . Thus, polis is used in the political sense too, denoting Gambrion as well as its surrounding territory from which troops could be recruited and taxes levied. For a discussion of such fiefdoms, see e.g. Briant ( 1985 ). The community must have been under Persian control throughout the Classical period, presumably as part of the satrapy of Lydia. Aninscription of 326 / 5 , found in Gambrion,records a gift of land, house and garden by Krateuas (presumably a Makedonian) to Aristomenes ( Syll . ³ 302 = Guarducci ( 1974 ) 310 -11 ). In the preamble ( 4 -5 ) it gives the name of Menander ( Μενάνδ [ ρ ] ου σατραπευacuteοντος ), who was given the Lydian satrapy by Alexander the Great. An eponymous official ( πρυacuteτανις ) is mentioned; but it is suggestive that there is no mention of any Gambrian decision-making body. The inscription suggests that the Makedonians may have controlled land-ownership directly. The extent to which Gambrion had undergone a process of Helation during the Classical period is unknown.

As part of the original Aiolian dodekapolis Gryneion is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 , with the territorial sense as a possible connotation, and in the political sense at Hdt. 1 . 150 . 2 and in a C4l inscription ( Iscr. Cos ED 71 B. 3 ). At Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 6 polis is used in the urban and political senses combined, denoting a dependent polis ( infra ). In Ps.-Skylax 98 Gryneion is one of the toponyms listed after the heading πόλεις . . . ' Ελληνίδες . . . αιasperacuteδε . In Iscr. Cos ED 71 B. 5 politeia is used in the sense of citizenship. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in Iscr. Cos ED 71 B. 4 and on C3 coins ( SNG Cop. Aiolis 202 -7 ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 265 . i . 17 ). Xenophon refers to Gryneion as one of the personal fiefs which had been given to Gongylos by the Persian king in C5 , and which were still controlled by his descendants in C4e ( Hell . 3 . 1 . 6 ; see also Briant ( 1985 )).Yet Gryneion was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . vii . 16 ) to 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 18 ) a total of thirteen times, three times completely restored, paying a phoros of first 1 , 000 dr. but from 433 / 2 , 2 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 279 . i . 59 ). This suggests that the Persian king (and probably also Gongylos and his family) did not exercise control over Gryneion at least during C5s. In 335 / 4 Gryneion was captured by Parmenion, who subjected its population to andrapodismos (Diod. 17 . 7 . 9 ); but the attested C3 coinage ( SNG Cop. Aeolis 202 -7 ) along with Segre Iscr. Cos ED 71 B (C4l) shows that resettlement must have happened soon afterwards. The earliest detailed information about the political institutions is found in Iscr. Cos ED 71 B (C4l). The decree, passed by boule ( βόλλα ) and assembly ( δαtilde µ ος ), bestows citizenship, proxenia , egktesis ges kai oikias , and privileged access to the courts on the Koan honorand. The grant of citizenship, egktesis , and dikai prodikoi is to be ratified by vote in the assembly (ll. 4 -7 ). Diplomatic relations through embassies are also attested in this decree. Gryneion contained a sanctuary and oracle of Apollo Gryneieus ( I.Delos 104 ( 8 ) B (C4m)),which was still operating as late as C1 (Bean ( 1974 -75 ) 85 -87 no. 21 and discussion of the oracle and sanctuary in Ragone ( 1990 )). Recent excavations have uncovered a cemetery with graves of C7 -C4 (Mitchell ( 1999 ) 143 )."

Hell . 3 . 1 . 6 ; An . 7 . 8 . 17 ). Halisarna is called a polis in Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 6 , where polis is used in the urban and political senses combined. It is a town captured by Thibron, but it is also reported that Halisarna was ruled, presumably as a tyranny ( ηtildeρχον ), by Prokles and Eurysthenes, descendants of Demaratos of Lakedaimon (see also An . 7 . 8 . 17 , indicating that Halisarna was ruled by Prokles). For Demaratos, who was given 'land and cities' ( γηtildeν τε καιgrave πόλιας ) by the Persian king in 486 , see Hdt. 6 . 70 . See also Briant ( 1985 ). In Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 6 , Halisarna is mentioned together with the poleis Pergamon and Teuthrania, all of which were given to Demaratos: Xenophon's phrasing αυasperacuteτη ηasper χώρα suggests that the territories of the three cities were not far apart. There is a possible solution to the conflict between Xenophon and Steph. Byz. 75 . 9 -10 , which places Halisarna in the Troad: the Stephanos entry has τοgrave εθνικοgraveν οasper αυτοgraveς Αasperλισαρναῖος . This is a strong indication that the original entry may have referred to two or more sites of the same name, and that the epitomiser has left out references to the community mentioned by Xenophon. Nothing is known about the ethnic composition of Halisarna's citizen body."

The toponym may be attested in Steph. Byz. 303 . 17 ( γ ' Λυδίας ); see the discussion in Robert ( 1937 ) 115 -16 , who also dismisses the identification of this Herakleia with the κ ' πόλις προgraveς τηsubiotaηtilde Κυ µ αίΩsubiotaα τηtildeς Αιολίδος in Steph. Byz. 304 . 1 . The city-ethnic ' Ηρακλεώτης is attested in Syll . ³ 934 (C5 ), where the collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally. This inscription is a boundary stone marking the frontier between the territory of the Herakleotai and that of the Melampagitai.The collective and internal use is presumably attested in abbreviated form on C4 coins ( infra ). Ramsay ( 1881 ) 297 argued in favour of locating Herakleia at a site near the station at Emir Aalem where he observed 'a grassgrown tumulus, and a little beyond it is a hill, with remains of a small fortified town. The walls could be traced all round the hill, sometimes appearing above the ground, sometimes showing only a slight elevation in the grassy hill. The style of building was not apparent, but was certainly not the finer kind of Greek work.'Keil ( 1913 ) 163 -64 adopted a more cautious position,pointing out that there were remains of many ancient settlements in the area, none of which can be identified with Herakleia with any certainty. Herakleia struck silver coins in C5 : types: obv . head of eagle and traces of letters; rev . square incuse; legend: ΗΡΑΚ . The similarity between the Herakleian coins and the coins minted by C5 Kyme is noted by Mørkholm ( 1964 ) 77 ."

The toponym is ΙΟΛΛΑ , the city-ethnic is ΙΟΛΛΕΩΝ (of ' Ιολλευacuteς ), both attested only on coins ( infra ). The location of Iolla remains conjectural: see most recently Stauber ( 1996 b ) 106 , who suggests Fughla Tepe near Boirazlı/Kızıklı. Robert ( 1937 ) 167 -68 suggested that the river Ollius mentioned by Pliny, HN 5 . 121 -23 is a distortion of the name Iolla, and that the community may have adopted the name of the river. Iolla struck bronze coins throughout C4 . ( 1 ) C. 400 : obv . head of Hermes; rev . forepart of Pegasos; legend: ΙΟΛΛΑ . ( 2 ) C. 350 : obv . head of Zeus; rev . forepart of Pegasos; legend: ΙΟΛΛΕΩΝ or, sometimes, ΙΟΛΛΑ (Stauber ( 1996 a ) ii. 248 -49 nos. 1 -8 ). Nothing is known about the ethnic composition of Iolla's citizen body."

The toponym is Καρήνη , ηasper (Hdt. 7 . 42 ). The city-ethnic is Καρηναῖος (Krateros ( FGrHist 342 ) fr. 2 ). The site cannot be located with precision: see Stauber ( 1996 a ) i. 241 -46 , who suggests the hill Ag. Ilias (Gökçea˘ gıl) as a possibility. Karene is called a polis in Hdt. 7 . 42 . 1 , principally in the territorial sense. That it was a polis in the political sense too is indicated by its membership of the Delian League ( infra ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is found externally in Krateros fr. 2 , a direct quotation from his On Psephismata book 3 : Γρυνεῖς , Πιταναῖοι , Καρηναῖοι . This quotation may suggest that Karene was recorded as a member of the Delian League in the assessment list of 454 / 3 , although the city-ethnic is not found in any of the surviving Athenian tribute lists or tribute assessments, as argued by Meritt ( ATL i. 495 -96 ). Their proposition that Karene belonged to the Lesbian or Chian peraiai in the Classical period is plausible,but cannot be verified. According to Ephor. fr. 126 , a contingent of citizens of Karene settled in Ephesos in connection with a stasis shortly after the foundation of Ephesos and gave their name to one of the five Ephesian phylai ."

As part of the original Aiolian dodekapolis Killa is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 , with the territorial sense as a possible connotation, and in the political sense at Hdt. 1 . 150 . 2 . This Killa, situated somewhere near Antandros (Strabo. 13 . 1 . 62 ), is probably not identical with the 'Homeric' Killa in the Troad (Hom. Il 1 . 38 , 452 ; see Stauber ( 1996 a ) i. 31 -33 )."

The toponym is Κισθήνη , ηasper (Isoc. 4 . 153 ). The full form of the city-ethnic is not attested, but the legend ΚΙΣΘΗ on C4 coins is presumably an abbreviated form ( infra ). Kisthene has been located (with some caution) at Gömeç by Stauber ( 1996 a ) i. 159 -62 . According to Isoc. 4 . 153 , Kisthene was conquered by Agesilaos and his troops in 397 , and the soldiers were rewarded with 100 tal. This piece of information must be taken with a grain of salt; but if this figure is anywhere near the truth, it is an important indication of the prosperity of Kisthene. Kisthene struck coins in C4 . ( 1 ) Silver and bronze issued by Orontas c. 357 -352 (or perhaps in 362 / 1 : for this dispute, see Troxell ( 1981 ); contra Moysey ( 1989 )).

Presumably polis is used here in its territorial sense, denoting Kyllene's urban centre and its hinterland. But the reference to the Egyptians' unfailing loyalty indicates that the political sense is a connotation. Xenophon claims that in his day the polis is still inhabited by the descendants of the Egyptians. It is not known what proportion (if any) of its citizen body would be perceived as Greek."
817,Kyme (Kymaios),Aiolis and South-western Mysia,38.45,26.55,1528,7596,"817 . Kyme (Kymaios) Map 56 . Lat. 38 . 45 , long. 26 . 55 . Size of territory: 2 or 3 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Κυacute µ η , ηasper (Hes. Op . 636 ; Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 ; Thuc. 3 . 31 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 98 ; SEG 23 189 . ii . 18 ( c. 330 )). The city-ethnic is Κυ µ αῖος (Hdt. 1 . 158 , 4 . 138 ; IG i³ 71 . i . 124 ). According to Steph. Byz. 80 . 23 -25 , Hecat.fr. 226 provided an alternative toponym, Α µ αζόνιον , and at 1 . 149 . 1 Herodotos has Κυacute µ η ηasper Φρικωνιgraveς καλεο µ ένη (according to Strabo 13 . 1 . 3 , called Phrikonis after Mt. Phrikion in Lokris). As part of the original Aiolian dodekapolis Kyme is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 and 5 . 123 . 1 , in both cases with the territorial sense as a possible connotation, and in the political sense at Hdt. 1 . 150 . 2 . The urban sense is also attested at Thuc. 3 . 31 . 1 and Ps.-Skylax 98 , and the political sense at Hdt. 4 . 137 . 2 , 138 . 2 and 5 . 37 . 2 -38 . 1 , where Kyme is listed under the heading polis among a number of tyrannically governed communities. Aristotle included Kyme among his politeiai : Κυ µ αίων πολιτεία = no. 90 frr. 530 -31 ; Heracl. Lemb. 36 -39 . The word astos is used about the citizens of Kyme in Hdt. 1 . 158 . 2 . The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is attested on Heltic coins ( SNG Cop. Aeolis 103 -15 ), in abbreviated forms on coins of the Classical period ( infra ); the external use is attested in literary sources (Hdt. 1 . 157 . 3 ) and in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 261 . v . 2 ). The individual use is attested externally in Hdt. 4 . 138 . 2 , 5 . 37 . 1 and IG ii² 9116 (C4 ). The territory was called Κυ µ αία , ηasper (Thuc. 8 . 101 . 2 ), and it comprised a settlement called Blakeia (Arist. fr. 531 . 1 -2 ). Idil ( 1989 ) 529 reported on the existence of two harbours, both of which were probably used for military purposes in C5 and C4 . Ps.-Skylax 98 mentions only one (see map in Bean ( 1966 ) 104 fig 15 ). Kyme was a dependent polis in the Persian Empire: Hdt. 7 . 194 . 1 mentions a Sandokes son of Thamasios, οasper αποgrave τηtildeς Κυacute µ ης τηtildeς Αιολίδος υasperacuteπαρχος , who served as general in Xerxes' fleet. We do not know if Kyme participated in the Ionian Revolt: the only Aiolians mentioned specifically by Herodotos are the Lesbians, and from his account it appears that there was no Kymaian naval contingent present at the battle of Lade. In C5 Kyme was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . v . 2 ) to 421 / 20 ( IG i³ 285 . ii . 10 ) a total of thirteen times, twice completely restored. In the first years it paid 12 tal., from 448 / 7 reduced to 9 tal. ( IG i³ 264 . i . 13 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 124 ). In 411 Kyme supplied a contingent of fifty hoplites to help the Spartans and Methymnaians against the Athenians and the Mytilenaians (Thuc. 8 . 100 . 3 ). In 408 the Kymaians sent an embassy to Athens to complain of Alkibiades' conduct (Diod. 13 . 73 . 6 ). Kymaians appointed theorodokoi to host theoroi from Argos ( SEG 23 189 . ii . 18 ( 330 -324 )), and to host theoroi from Nemea ( SEG 36 331 . ii . 34 -35 ( 331 / 30 -313 )). Little is known about the constitutional history of Kyme. Herakleides ( Polit . 10 . 16 ) reports that Pheidon and later Prometheus legislated in order to enfranchise more citizens (perhaps after 700 ). According to Pheidon's law, the franchise was given to citizens who could breed at least one horse. Later Prometheus included another thousand citizens in the constitution. The constitution was replaced by a tyranny at the bidding of Kyros (Herakleides, Polit . 11 . 5 : Κυtildeρος δεgrave καταλυacuteσας τηgraveν πολιτείαν µ οναρχεῖσθαι αυτουgraveς εποίηςεν ). According to Arist. fr. 530 , 1 -2 , the official title of the tyrant was αισυ µ νήτης . C. 512 the tyrant of Kyme was Aristagoras, son of Herakleides (Hdt. 4 . 138 . 2 ), who was deposed in 500 / 499 , but not killed by the Kymaians (Hdt. 5 . 37 -38 ). Later (perhaps much later) the polis had a democratic constitution which, again, was replaced by an oligarchy on the instigation of a certain Thrasymachos,who is characterised as a 'demagogos' (Arist. Pol . 1304 b 41 -5 a 1 , probably referring to Aiolic Kyme; cf.Aubonnet in the Budé edn. p. 171 n. 2 ). The stasis was triggered by the democrats using their power to soak the rich ( b 20 -24 ). One of Plutarch's Quaestiones Graecae -presumably derived from the Aristotelian collection of politeiai -concerns Kyme, probably Aiolian Kyme, and mentions a boule , a board of basileis and a magistrate in charge of the desmoterion (Plut. Mor . 291 E-92 A).So far, the only surviving public enactment antedating 306 is I.Kyme 1 , a C4l honorary decree passed by the demos . Arist. Pol . 1268 b -1269 a refers to legislation ( nomos ) on homicide.Free non-citizens appear to have been resident in Kyme: a funerary inscription found at Kyme near the sanctuary of Isis and datable to C4 commemorates a citizen of Lampsakos ( BCH 51 ( 1927 ) p. 386 no. 7 ). The inscription SEG 47 1663 ( c. 500 ) mentions two foreigners, one from Paros and one from Samos. In 546 the Kymaians sent θεοπρόποι to the oracle in Branchidai (Hdt. 1 . 157 -60 ). According to Diod. 15 . 18 . 2 , Kyme and Klazomenai consulted the oracle in Delphi in 383 , shortly after the death of Tachos, in connection with their dispute over Leukai, which contained an Apollo sanctuary (Fontenrose ( 1978 ) H 15 ). Until now few remains of Archaic and Classical public architecture have been excavated. An Isis temple, excavated by Salac in 1925 , may have dated back to C4 , perhaps originally dedicated to a different goddess (Kybele/Artemis, later also Aphrodite, as suggested by Idil ( 1989 ) 527 ). Akurgal ( 1956 ) 12 reported on a C4 capital. Schäfer and Schläger ( 1962 ) 52 describe a pier, in part from C6 . Recent deep soundings have revealed a late Archaic building on one of Kyme's two acropolises (Gates ( 1997 )). Kyme was probably fortified as early as C6 (Hdt. 1 . 160 . 1 , who reports on the reluctance by the citizens of Kyme to incur the risk of a siege in 546 ). Recently, Archaic walls have been discovered beneath the Heltic fortifications (Gates ( 1994 ) 275 ). The city was besieged by Tissaphernes c. 400 (Diod. 14 . 35 . 7 ). Kyme struck coins of silver and bronze from C7l onwards. Denominations: stater, hemidrachm, hemiobol. ( 1 ) Silver, C7l: obv . forepart of horse, beneath, monogram (?); rev . incuse square containing ornamented star,beside it (as countermark) smaller incuse square containing a star of different design. ( 2 ) Silver, c. 480 -450 : obv . eagle's head; legend: ΚΥ ; rev . incuse square of mill-sail pattern.

( 4 ) Bronze, c. 350 -320 : obv . eagle standing, or forepart of horse; legend: magistrate's name and/or ΚΥ ; rev . vase with one handle; legend: ΚΥ . (Babelon, Traité ii. 2 . 1169 -72 nos. 2058 -63 , ( 1930 ) 28 ; BMC Troas 104 -5 ; SNG Cop.Aeolis 30 -86 .) According to Ephor. fr. 114 , Kyme was founded by Amazons.Kyme reportedly colonised (or participated in the colonisations of) ( 1 ) Kebren in the Troad (Ephor. fr. 10 ); ( 2 ) Ainos in Thrace,which was first founded by Alopekonnesioi and later received epoikoi from Mytilene and Kyme (Ephor. fr. 39 ); and ( 3 ) Side in Pamphylia (Ps.-Skylax 101 ; Arr. Anab . 1 . 26 ; Strabo 14 . 4 . 2 )."
818,Larisa (Larisaios),Aiolis and South-western Mysia,38.4,27.0,1067,5417,"818 . Larisa (Larisaios) Map 56 . Lat. 38 . 40 , long. 27 . 00 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: β . The toponym is Λήρισαι , αιasper (Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 ) or Λάρισα , ηasper (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 7 ), sometimes distinguished from other towns called Larisa by the epithets Φρικωνίς (Strabo 13 . 3 . 4 , explained at 13 . 1 . 3 ; cf. supra 1043 ) or Αιγυπτία (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 7 ). The city-ethnic is Λαρισαῖος (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 7 ) or Ληρισαῖος ( IG i³ 71 . i . 152 , but see infra ). The legend ΛΑΡΙΣΑΙ on C4 coins is presumably an abbreviated form of the city-ethnic rather than the toponym ( infra ). As part of the original Aiolian dodekapolis Larisa is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 , with the territorial sense as a possible connotation, and in the political sense at Hdt. 1 . 150 . 2 . Larisa is called a polis in Xen. Cyr . 7 . 1 . 45 in a retrospective C6 context, describing how Kyros gave Kyllene and Larisa to his Egyptian troops in 546 . Presumably polis is used here in its topographical sense,denoting Larisa's urban centre and its hinterland. But the reference to the Egyptians'unfailing loyalty indicates that the political sense is a connotation. The collective use of the city-ethnic is presumably attested internally on coins ( infra ). It is attested externally at Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 7 and possibly in the Athenian assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 152 ). The toponym is restored in the assessment decree of 422 / 1 ( IG i³ 77 . iv . 19 ). Larisa was perhaps claimed by the Athenians as a member of the Delian League: the city-ethnic Λερισαῖοι in IG i³ 71 . i . 152 is listed in the Ionian district immediately after Πυγελ ˜ ες , which might indicate that the reference is to the other Larisa at Ephesos. However, it is impossible to draw any firm geographical conclusion on the basis of the sequence of poleis in the Athenian lists, and the city-ethnic of Ephesian Larisa attested in inscriptions of the Roman period (e.g. I.Ephesos 3272 and 3274 ) is Λαρισηνός , which indicates that the Larisa in the assessment decree is in fact the one in Aiolis. There is no epigraphical attestation of Larisa's diplomatic relations with the outside world before the early Heltic period (Fraser, Samothrace ii . 1 no. 23 1 -2 (C3l/C2e), which mentions theoroi ). Schefold ( 1933 ) 145 -48 reports on stoas from the Archaic and Classical periods (C6f and C5 ). In his publication he also reported that on the acropolis, three-quarters of which had been excavated, he had found remains of a road, walls, towers, gates, an altar and temple, a palace and wells, all of which seemed to date from the Archaic period. The fortifications, however, have later been downdated to C5 (Lang ( 1996 ) 228 -29 ). Lang's account (( 1996 ) 224 ) mentions a preGreek cult site, on top of which a small C6 temple was built, followed by a much larger temple c. 530 . The palace, of the bit-hilani type, was constructed in three phases in C6 , with later work of rebuilding c. 400 (Boehlau and Schefold ( 1940 ) 27 -30 ). For a very useful summary of the remains of Archaic Larisa,see Lang ( 1996 ) 224 -31 . Water was supplied to the fortified city by pipes (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 7 ). Schefold ( 1933 ) 148 described two cisterns and a well of polygonal masonry next to a large building complex from C5 . The building may have been used for public administration. Larisa was walled in C4 (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 7 ), and the remains of the C4fortification of both the acropolis and the town are described in Boehlau and Schefold ( 1940 ) 52 -56 . The coinage of Larisa Phrikonis has generated a good deal of controversy. The coins in question are C4 issues of silver and bronze. ( 1 ) Silver: obv . female head wearing sphendone; rev . amphora; legend: ΛΑΡΙΣΑΙ . ( 2 ) Bronze: obv . bearded head; rev . amphora between corn-gain,r.and ΛΑΡΙΣΑΙ , l. ( 3 ) Bronze: obv . female head l.; rev . amphora; above, bunch of grapes; on l., caduceus; on r., ear of corn; legend: ΛΑΡΙ . ( 4 ) Bronze: obv . horned river-god three-quarters facing to. r.; rev . Apollo laureate; legend: ΛΑ . ( 5 ) Bronze: obv . head of river-god; rev . head of bull; legend: ΛΑ . All five issues are ascribed to Larisa Phrikonis by Head, HN ² 555 . SNG Cop. Aeolis 208 -12 ascribe ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) to Larisa Phrikonis.In BMC Troas p. 134 ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are ascribed to Larisa in Troas. On the problem relating to the attribution of coins to each of the three Asian poleis called Larisa, see Imhoof-Blumer ( 1901 -2 ) 1171 -76 nos. 2064 -70 and Robert ( 1951 ) 47 -64 , who wants the amphora types ( 1 )-( 4 ), with both male and female heads, to be ascribed to Larisa in the Troad, while the 'bulltypes' ( 5 ) should be assigned to Larisa Phrikonis on the grounds that a similar type was minted in Boione, which presumably was located nearby in the Hermos valley;cf.also Robert ( 1982 ). In 546 Kyros gave Larisa to his Egyptian troops, whose descendants were still inhabiting the polis in Xenophon's day (Xen. Cyr . 7 . 1 . 45 ). The presence of a non-Greek element may explain the existence of a palace. However, the presence of an Archaic Aiolian population is confirmed by C7 and C6 graffiti at the temple of Athena (Boehlau and Schefold ( 1943 ) 123 and 183 ). It is conceivable that they made up a considerable proportion of the citizen body of Larisa in the Classical period, and that the polis was considered Greek."
819,Leukai (Leokates),Aiolis and South-western Mysia,38.35,26.5,654,3326,"819 . Leukai (Leokates) Map 56 . Lat. 38 . 35 , long. 26 . 50 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: β . The toponym is Λευtildeκαι , αιasper (Ps.Skylax 98 ; Strabo 14 . 1 . 38 ) or Λευacuteκη , ηasper (Diod. 15 . 18 . 1 -2 ). The city-ethnic is Λεοκάτης (Babelon, Traité ii. 2 . 2046 ) or Λευκαιευacuteς (ibid. 2047 , after Alexander the Great). Leukai is implicitly called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax. 98 (cf. Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ) and retrospectively by Diodorus at 15 . 92 . 1 (r 362 / 1 ) (urban sense) and 15 . 18 . 1 -2 (rC4 ) (political sense). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ). The name and extent of its territory are not attested for the Classical period; but according to Ps.-Skylax 98 , it contained more than one harbour ( Λευtildeκαι καιgrave λι µ ένες ). Leukai was situated on the coast (Diod. 15 . 18 . 1 ) between Smyrna and Phokaia (Strabo 14 . 1 . 38 ). In Barr . it is represented as an island c. 10 km south of the coast of Asia Minor. The only authority for this is Plin. HN 5 . 119 : oppidum Leucae in promonturio, quod insula fuit . If this piece of information carries any weight, it must relate to the Archaic period or before. In the Classical, Heltic, Roman and Late Roman periods Leukai must have been a coastal city. Leukai was founded by Tachos after the death of Glos c. 383 / 2 (Diod. 15 . 18 . 1 ; see Stylianou ( 1997 ) 208 ). Later, both Kyme and Klazomenai wanted to gain control of Leukai and consulted the oracle in Delphi, who responded that the polis that first managed to make a sacrifice at Leukai at a specified date should be the winner of the dispute (Diod. 15 . 18 . 2 ; see Fontenrose ( 1978 ) H 15 ). Since it was stipulated that representatives from the two poleis should depart at dawn on the day specified for the sacrifice, the Klazomenians founded a polis close to Leukai and thus won the contest. This event was commemorated by a festival called Prophthaseia (Diod. 15 . 18 . 3 -4 , but without any indication of whether the festival was held at Klazomenai or Leukai). C. 362 Leukai served as a naval base for the Egyptian fleet commanded by Reomithres (Diod. 15 . 92 . 1 ). Leukai possessed a sanctuary of Apollo (Diod. 15 . 18 . 1 ). Leukai struck coins in silver and bronze in C4s. Denominations: obol, hemiobol and small fractions in bronze. ( 1 ) Silver obol: types: obv . head of Aphrodite or Artemis, crescent; legend: Λ ; rev . swan, crescent; legend: Λ . ( 2 ) Silver hemiobol: obv . head of Zeus; legend: ΛΕΥ ; rev . forepart or head of boar; legend: ΛΕΥ . ( 3 ) Bronze: obv . head of Apollo; rev . swan; legend: ΛΕΟΚΑΤΩΝ or ΛΕΟ . ( 4 ) Bronze: obv . head of Athena; rev . lion standing; legend: ΛΕΥ . ( 5 ) Bronze: obv . head of Apollo; rev . swan or swan before tripod; legend: ΛΕΥΚΑΙΕΩΝ or ΛΕΥ and magistrate's name (Babelon, Traité ii. 2 . 1159 -62 nos. 2041 -48 ; Head, HN ² 581 ; SNG Cop. Ionia 799 -801 ). According to Babelon ( Traité II. 21159 -60 ), the striking similarity between the coins of Klazomenai and those of Leuke suggests that Leuke was a polis dependent on Klazomenai. The ethnic composition of the population of Leukai is not known;but it may have contained a non-Greek element, given the history of its foundation, even after it became a Klazomenian dependency."
820,Magnesia (Magnes),Aiolis and South-western Mysia,38.35,27.25,132,696,"820 . Magnesia (Magnes) Map 56 . Lat. 38 . 35 , long. 27 . 25 . Size of territory: ? Type: C:? The toponym is Μαγνησίη , ηasper (Hellan. fr. 191 ). The city-ethnic is Μάγνης ( infra ). The only pre-Heltic attestation of the city-ethnic is external, individual and admittedly uncertain: a C6 graffito from Abydos has been restored as [ Μάγν ] ης ηtildeλθ ' [ ε ] νθάδε Κάϊκος (Ihnken ( 1978 ) 160 T 13 = Jeffery ( 1990 ) 361 no. 2 ). Neither Ihnken nor Jeffery explains why this heavily restored ethnic is to be connected with Magnesia on Mt. Sipylos rather than with Magnesia on the Maiandros, or with Magnesia at all. Nothing further is known about Magnesia in the Archaic and Classical periods."

There is no attestation of the toponym. The city-ethnic is Μελανπαγίτης ( Syll . ³ 934 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested in an internal context in C5 : a graffito οasperacuteρια Μελανπαγιτῶν ' Ηρακλεωτῶν marked the common boundary between the territory of the Melampagitai and the neighbouring Herakleotai. The settlement was located near Gökkaya by Ramsay ( 1881 ) 296 -97 . Keil ( 1913 ) 166 -68 reported on an intricate network of walls which can only be explained satisfactorily by a proper excavation. However, a wall of rough polygonal masonry on the eastern side of the hill-top was tentatively identified as a fortification wall enclosing the settlement. Keil also noted the similarity between the retaining walls of the settlement and those found at the acropolis of Neon Teichos."

The toponym is Μυacuteρινα , ηasper (Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 6 ). The city-ethnic is Μυριναῖος ( IG i³ 71 . i . 179 -80 ).As part of the original Aiolian dodekapolis Myrina is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 , with the territorial sense as a possible connotation, and in the political sense at Hdt. 1 . 150 . 2 . In C4 it is called polis in the urban sense in Ps.-Skylax 98 . At Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 6 polis is used in the urban and political senses combined, denoting a dependent polis ( infra ). Xenophon mentions Myrina as one of the personal fiefs given by the Persian king to Gongylos, whose descendants were still in control in the early C4 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on Heltic coins ( SNG Cop. Aeolis 221 ff), in abbreviated forms on coins of the Classical period ( infra ), and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 265 . i . 11 ). The individual and external use is attested in Heltic inscriptions, e.g. ∆α µ όθεος Μυριναῖος , a metic living in Iasos ( I.Iasos 192 . 7 ). Myrina was allegedly founded by Amazons (Strabo 13 . 3 . 6 ), but a tradition recorded in Euseb. vii 1 . 69 . 12 c and vii 2 . 183 c claims that Myrina was founded in 1046 by Aiolians. Myrina was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded in the Athenian tribute lists by toponym ( IG i³ 266 . i . 14 ) or by city-ethnic ( IG i³ 265 . i . 11 ). It is recorded from 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . viii . 11 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 18 ) a total of eighteen times, three times completely restored, and in one case Myrina on Lemnos is an alternative, paying a phoros of 1 tal. ( IG i³ 266 . i . 14 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 179 -80 ). Pottier and Reinach, who excavated the cemetery of Myrina,noted a hill resembling an acropolis with remains of ancient fortifications, and a city wall of polygonal masonry of varying quality (( 1882 ) 201 ; cf. Bean ( 1966 ) 106 -10 ). Myrina struck coins of silver in C4 and of bronze in C4 -C3 . ( 1 ) Silver hemidrachms: types: obv . head of Athena wearing Corinthian helmet; rev . bust of Artemis facing; legend: ΜΥ . ( 2 ) Bronze: obv . head of Athena wearing Attic helmet; rev . amphora; legend: ΜΥ or ΜΥΡΙ (Head, HN ² 555 (C4 ); SNG von Aulock no. 1659 (C4 -C3 ); SNG Cop.Aeolis 213 -20 )."
823,Nasos (Nasiotas),Aiolis and South-western Mysia,39.2,26.4,604,3022,"823 . Nasos (Nasiotas) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 20 , long. 26 . 40 . Size of territory: 1 ( c. 15 km ² ). Type: A: α . The toponym, Νηtildeσος , ηasper or Aiolic Ναtildeσος , is attested only in the entry Ν ˜ εσος Πορδοσελένε in IG i³ 77 . iv . 17 . The city-ethnic is Νασιώτας ( I.Adramytteion 34 A. 40 (C4l)). The Aiolian polis (in the urban/topographical sense) in the Hekatonnesoi mentioned in Hdt. 1 . 151 . 1 probably refers to this community. Nasos is called polis in the personal/political sense in I.Adramytteion 34 A. 9 , 14 , 19 , 24 -25 , 33 ( 319 -317 ); and in the same inscription the word polites is used in the plural of its citizens ( 34 A. 22 ). Nesos Pordoselene is recorded in the assessment decree IG i³ 77 . iv . 17 under the heading Aktaioi poleis . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on C4 coins ( infra ) and in a C4l inscription ( I.Adramytteion 34 A. 40 ). Nasos was located on the island of Alibey Adası, and was probably identical with the community known as Pordoselene (see Stauber ( 1996 a ) i. 198 -209 and the entry Pordoselene ). The community was entered by toponym in the assessment decree IG i³ 77 . iv . 17 as one of the Aktaioi poleis , but we cannot be sure that it was ever a paying member of the Delian League. The toponym is completely restored in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . iii . 127 -28 ), and it does not appear in any of the surviving Athenian tribute lists.The fact that it was entered as one of the Aktaioi poleis may suggest that it was a polis dependent on Lesbos, presumably Mytilene (no. 798 ). One psephisma passed by the assembly of the Nasiotai survives: I.Adramytteion 34 ( 319 -317 ), which is referred to as a ψάφισ µ α on face A, lines 46 and 50 . On face B. 55 -56 there is a reference to a nomos concerning the offence of overthrowing the democracy ([ π ] εριgrave τῶν καλ [ λυ ] όντων τοgraveν δαtilde [ µ ον ], 55 -58 ). Fines and atimia are imposed in the entrenchment clause to this decree (B. 45 -52 ). The boule ( βόλλα ) is mentioned (B. 15 -16 ), and other magistrates mentioned in this inscription are the χοροστάτας (A. 36 ), τα µ ίαι (A. 45 ), εξετασταί (B. 2 -3 , 60 -61 ), and an επι µ ήνιος (B. 38 ). The assembly is referred to in several places in this decree, and there is specific reference to a κυρία εκκλησία (B. 22 -23 ). A prytaneion is attested (A. 32 -33 ); but so far monumental architecture from the Classical period has not been recorded (Stauber ( 1996 a ) i. 208 -12 ). Taxes were levied on the community by Antipatros, presumably in the 320 s (A. 9 -14 ). I.Adramytteion 36 (C4l) may also have been passed byNasos/Pordoselene;but since it cannot be ascribed to this polis with certainty,it will not be used in the present context. Nasos struck coins of silver (hemidrachm) and bronze in C4 . Types: obv . head of Apollo; rev . panther with various symbols: head of ram or club, etc.; legend: ΝΑΣΙ or ΝΑΣ or ΝΑ (Stauber ( 1996 a ) ii. 283 -96 ; SNG Cop.Aeolis 429 -31 )."

The toponym is Νέον Τεῖχος , τό (Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 ). As part of the original Aiolian dodekapolis Neon Teichos is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 , with the territorial sense as a possible connotation, and in the political sense at Hdt. 1 . 150 . 2 . Xen. An . 7 . 5 . 8 simply designates it τεῖχος . According to Ps. Her. vit. Hom . 9 , Neon Teichos was a foundation from Kyme,founded 8 years after that city. If the identification of the ruins at Yan  ık Köy with ancient Neon Teichos is correct, then the settlement was walled (Ramsay ( 1881 ) 281 ); but the precise location of Neon Teichos is still controversial. According to a tradition recorded in Strabo 13 . 3 . 3 , Neon Teichos was founded by Lokrians whose ultimate aim was to capture Larisa Phrikonis."

Unless this Notion is in fact identical with Notion near Kolophon (a conventional but unwarranted equation,for which see most recently Hoepfner et al .

It was a town captured by Thibron, but it is also described as a personal fief which had been given by the Persian king to Gongylos of Eretria in C5 , whose descendants were still in control in C4e. Thus, polis is used in the political sense too, denoting Palaigambrion as well as its surrounding territory as a place from which troops could be recruited and taxes levied."

The toponym is Πέργα µ ον , τό (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 6 ; An . 7 . 8 . 8 , 23 ). The cityethnic is Περγα µ ηνός ( Staatsverträge 555 (C3e)).Pergamon is called a polis in Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 6 , where polis is used in the urban and political senses combined.It was a town captured by Thibron, but it is also reported that Pergamon was ruled, presumably as a tyranny ( ηtildeρχον ), by Prokles and Eurysthenes,descendants of Demaratos of Lakedaimon (see also An . 7 . 8 . 17 ). For Demaratos, who was given 'land and cities' ( γηtildeν τε καιgrave πόλιας ) by the Persian king in 486 , see Hdt. 6 . 70 . See also Briant ( 1985 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is presumably attested internally in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ). The individual and external use is found in an Epidaurian proxeny decree of C4l/C3e ( IAEpid 42 xiii). The constitutional history in the Archaic and Classical periods is unknown: in C4 it may still have been controlled by the descendants of Gongylos, who may have received the city as a fief from the Persian king. For a full description of the Archaic and Classical city walls, see Radt ( 1992 ). He discusses two walls, one of which (Wall I) may date from C7 or even earlier, while the other (Wall II) probably dates from C5 and covers an area of 18 ha (Radt ( 1994 ) 64 ). The article also contains extensive discussion of pottery found in the context of the walls; cf.also Radt ( 1999 ). Pergamon struck coins of silver and bronze from C5m to C4e. ( 1 ) Silver: types: obv . laureate head of Apollo; rev . bearded male head ('Satrapenkopf': SNG von Aulock no. 1347 ) in Persian head-dress, or head and neck of bull, all within incuse square; legend: ΠΕΡΓ or ΠΕΡΓΑ . ( 2 ) Bronze: obv . laureate head of Apollo; rev . two bulls' heads; legend: ΠΕΡΓ or ΠΕΡΓΑ ; or obv . female head; rev . boar's head, or two boars' heads; legend: ΠΕΡ or ΠΕΡΓ . Date: C5m-C4e: SNG Cop. Mysia 313 -16 . BMC Mysia p. 110 includes silver coinage from 420 -400 ; see also Babelon, Traité ii. 2 . 86 -89 nos. 43 -46 . SNG von Aulock no. 1348 ascribes the bronze coins to C4f. Despite Radt's discovery of significant amounts of Aiolian grey ware, the ethnic composition of Pergamon's population in the Archaic and Classical periods still remains uncertain. In Xen. An. 7 . 8 . 8 Xenophon is entertained by a woman called ' Ελλάς , wife of Gongylos of Eretria and mother of Gorgion and Gongylos. Ironically, her name may bear witness to her non-Greek origins or, at the very least, to the ethnically mixed nature of the community in which she lived.The name is rare,and the entries in LPGN suggest that, in the Greek world in the Classical period, it was borne predominantly by slaves. Her two sons controlled four cities in Mysia and Aiolis (Gambrion, Palaigambrion, Myrina and Gryneion) which the Persian king had given as fiefs to their ancestor in return for his loyalty as a mediser (Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 6 )."
829,Perperene (Perperenios),Aiolis and South-western Mysia,39.15,27.0,323,1704,"829 . Perperene (Perperenios) Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 15 , long. 27 . 00 . Size of territory: ? Type: C:? The toponym is Περπερήνα , ηasper (Galen, De Victu Attenuante 102 ; De Rebus Boni Malique Suci 6 ) or Παρπάρων (Apollodoros ( FGrHist 244 ) fr. 7 apud Steph. Byz. 508 . 11 -13 ). The city-ethnic is recorded as Παρπαρωνιώτης (Androtion ( FGrHist 324 ) fr. 15 apud Steph. Byz. 508 . 15 -16 ), but the three attested epigraphical (albeit Hell./Rom.) sources for the city-ethnic suggest that the normal version was Περπερήνιος ( I.Smyrna 447 . 4 , 469 . 2 -3 , 689 . ii . 23 -24 ). This is confirmed by C4 coin legends ΠΕΡΠΕ ( infra ). Perperene is not called a polis by any extant Classical source; Galen, De Victu Attenuante 102 provides the earliest attestation. The collective use of the city-ethnic is presumably attested internally in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ) and is attested externally in Androtion ( FGrHist 324 ) fr. 15 . Perperene was probably located 1 km north of the modern village of A  sa˘ gıbey, where substantial ruins may be identified as ancient Perperene, although according to Kaufmann and Stauber ( 1994 ) 41 , there is no direct evidence to confirm this identification; see also Stauber ( 1996 a ) i. 296 . Although no Archaic or Classical remains have been found on this site, Stauber ( 1996 a ) i. 303 points out that the visible buildings may have been erected on top of an older settlement.Only excavation may reveal the age of the original settlement. Perperene struck bronze coins in C4 . Types: obv . laureate head of Apollo; rev . bunch of grapes, branch and leaves in wreath; legend: ΠΕ or ΠΕΡ or ΠΕΡΠ or ΠΕΡΠΕ (Stauber ( 1996 a ) ii. 309 -25 , cat. nos. 1 -11 )."

The toponym is Πιτάνη , ηasper (Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is Πιταναῖος ( IG i³ 262 . iii . 24 ; Krateros ( FGrHist 342 ) fr. 2 apud Steph. Byz. 358 . 15 -16 ; AJP 56 ( 1935 ) 358 -79 i . 147 (C4 )). As part of the original Aiolian dodekapolis Pitane is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 , with the territorial sense as a possible connotation, and in the political sense at Hdt. 1 . 150 . 2 . In C4 , however,Ps.-Skylax 98 refers to Pitane as a limen only. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 262 . iii . 24 ). In C4 the individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in AJP 56 ( 1935 ) 358 -79 i . 147 (C4l) and F.Delphes iii . 1 410 ( 319 ), adding Aioleus as an indication of regional affiliation: ' ΗρακλείτΩsubiotaω Λυσιστράτου Αιολεῖ εκ Πιτάνης . Nothing is known explicitly about the extent of Pitane's territory in the Archaic and Classical periods. But since it bordered on Mt. Kane to the west, Elea to the east, and Teuthrania to the north, it is unlikely to have exceeded 100 km ² . The information that may be gleaned from Heltic sources cannot be used retrospectively (on territorial changes and consolidations in this area in the Heltic period, see most recently Savalli-Lestrade ( 1992 )). In C5 Pitane was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . vii . 17 ) to 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . i . 56 -58 , restored in 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . i . 41 )) a total of fifteen times, but five times completely restored, and paid 1 , 000 dr. in all years. Pitane received proxenia from Delphi in 319 ( F.Delphes iii . 1 410 ), and another grant of proxenia given to a citizen of Pitane is recorded in an undated (C3 ?) decree passed by an unknown polis located in Aiolis, most likely Kyme ( SEG 47 1659 ). Pitane had city walls in C4 , and probably also earlier. In 335 / 4 it was besieged by Parmenion, who was forced to lift the siege by Memnon (Diod. 17 . 7 . 9 ). Remains of the ancient fortifications of the peninsula of Çandarlı were described by Schuchhardt in Conze et al . ( 1912 -13 ) 99 -100 . Pitane struck bronze coins in C4 . Types: obv . head of Zeus Ammon; rev . pentagram; legend: ΠΙΤΑ or ΠΙΤΑΝΑ or ΠΙΤΑΝΑΙΩΝ ; or obv . Silenus; rev . omphalos entwined by serpent; legend: ΠΙΤΑΝΑΙΩΝ ( Fitz. Mus. Cat . III. 72 ; BMCMysia 171 -72 ; SNG Cop. Mysia 530 -35 )."
831,Pordoselene,Aiolis and South-western Mysia,39.2,26.4,541,2968,"831 . Pordoselene Map 56 . Lat. 39 . 20 , long. 26 . 40 , but see infra . Size of territory: 1 ? Type: A:? The toponym is Πορδοσελήνη (Ps.-Skylax 97 ; Arist. Hist. an. 605 b 29 -30 ). In C4 Pordoselene is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.Skylax 97 . If Nasos and Pordoselene were identical (see infra ) then this community was probably the one referred to as an Aiolian polis in the political sense by Hdt. 1 . 151 . 1 . The full form of the city-ethnic is unattested, but the collective and internal use is presumably attested in abbreviated form on coins: ΠΟΡ∆ΟΣΙΛ ( infra ). Pordoselene was entered by the toponym Ν ˜ εσος Πορδοσελένε on the tribute assessment list IG i³ 77 . iv . 17 ( 422 / 1 ), but it is not clear whether it was ever a paying member of the Delian League. It does not reappear in any surviving tribute list. The community is listed along with other Aktaioi poleis , suggesting that Nesos/Pordoselene was a Lesbian dependency in C5 . Pordoselene struck coins of silver and bronze from C5l to C4l. ( 1 ) Silver (drachms): types: obv . head of Apollo; rev . lyre, or panther, or crab or other symbol in incuse square; legend: ΠΟΡ or ΠΟΡ∆ or ΠΟΡ∆ΟΣΙΛ . ( 2 ) Bronze: obv . head of silenus; rev . dolphin; legend: ΠΟΡ (Stauber ( 1996 a ) ii. 297 -307 ). On the unfounded a priori assumption that only independent communities struck coins, Stauber ( 1996 a ) i. 199 assumes that the earliest coins minted by Pordoselene are evidence that it gained independence from Mytilene in 427 . Problems arise in connection with any attempt to locate the site of Pordoselene, the most vexing of which is the question whether Pordoselene was identical with the polis of the Nasiotai, an identification that may be suggested by the joint entry Nesos Pordoselene in IG i³ 77 . iv . 17 . It may also be significant that Hdt. 1 . 151 . 1 mentions only one polis on the islands known as Hekatonnesoi (however, the present Inventory does in itself indicate that Herodotos'enumerations of communities in various regions of the Greek world cannot be trusted to have been in any way comprehensive). The debate is summed up by Stauber ( 1996 a ) i. 198 -208 : communis opinio has been that Nasos and Pordoselene were two different poleis ; Nasos on the island now known as Alibey Adası and Pordoselene on the smaller island of Maden Adası. Stauber objects (ibid. 205 -7 ) that Maden Adası, being an infertile island of tuff, could not have supported a community in Antiquity: indeed, when surveying the island he found no evidence at all for an ancient settlement. Stauber is inclined to conclude that there was indeed only one community, which was located on Alibey Adası, and that Nasos/Nasiotes temporarily replaced the toponym and cityethnic of Pordoselene because the name containing the word 'fart' was perceived as an embarrassment. If Stauber's view is correct, then the information set out s.v. Nasos in the present Inventory applies to Pordoselene as well."

The toponym is Τηtilde µ νος (Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 ), οasper ( Suda Ε 3024 , conjectured at Strabo 13 . 1 . 70 ) or ηasper (Strabo 13 . 3 . 5 ). The city-ethnic is Τη µ νίτης (Xen. An . 4 . 4 . 15 ). The Aiolic forms Ταtilde µ νος / Τα µ νίτας are attested on C4 coins ( infra ) and in Heltic inscriptions ( I.Perg . 5 = Staatsverträge 555 (C3e)). As part of the original Aiolian dodekapolis Temnos is called a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 , with the territorial sense as a possible connotation, and in the political sense at Hdt. 1 . 150 . 2 . Xenophon refers to it as a polis in the urban sense, indicating that the community was small ( Hell . 4 . 8 . 5 : ου µ εγάλη πόλις )). The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic is presumably attested in abbreviated form on C4 coins ( infra ), the external use is found in a C3e decree ( I.Perg . 5 . 2 ). For the individual and external use, see Xen. An . 4 . 4 . 15 : ∆η µ οκράτης Τη µ νίτης . Although Temnos is attested as a flourishing community in the Heltic period (e.g. Herrmann ( 1979 )), next to nothing is known about the political and constitutional history of Temnos in the Archaic and Classical periods. The community may have been dependent on the Persian king (it was never a member of the Delian League, at any rate); in 394 , however, according to Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 5 , Derkylidas mentioned Temnos as a polis where it would be possible to live without being subjected ( υasperπήκοος ) to the Persian king. On this remark,which perhaps should not be taken too seriously, see the entry for Aigai supra . Temnos struck bronze coins in C4 . Types: obv . head of Dionysos, bearded, wreathed with ivy; rev . bunch of grapes with vine leaves and tendrils, the whole in slight circular incuse; legend: ΤΑ ( BMC Troas 142 ; SNG Cop.Mysia 246 -49 )."

The toponym is Τευθρανίη , ηasper (Hdt. 2 . 10 . 1 ) or Τευθρανία (Ps.-Skylax 98 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 6 ; An . 2 . 1 . 3 , 7 . 8 . 17 ). The full form of the city-ethnic is unattested, but the collective and internal use is presumably attested in abbreviated form on coins: ΤΕΥ ( infra ). Teuthrania is called a polis in Xen. Hell . 3 . 1 . 6 , where polis is used in the urban and political senses combined. It was a town captured by Thibron, but it is also reported that Teuthrania was ruled, presumably as a tyranny ( ηtildeρχον ), by Prokles and Eurysthenes, descendants of Demaratos of Lakedaimon. In An . 2 . 1 . 3 Prokles is referred to as οasper Τευθρανίας άρχων . For Demaratos, who was given 'land and cities' ( γηtildeν τε καιgrave πόλιας ) by the Persian king in 486 , see Hdt. 6 . 70 . See also Briant ( 1985 ). Teuthrania struck coins of silver and bronze c. 400 .

The only Archaic/Classical attestations of Thebe as a polis are connected with the Homeric tradition (Hom. Il . 1 . 366 , 6 . 414 -15 ; Eur. Andr . 1 ). Curtius Rufus, however, refers to Thebe as an 'urbs'in a retrospective C4 context ( Hist. Alex . 3 . 4 . 10 ). Thebe struck bronze coins in C4m.

In C4 Achilleion is called a polis in the urban sense by a single source: Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 17 , where it is reported that Thibron used Achilleion as a base for his raids against the territory of the Persian king. Achilleion was situated in the Maiandros valley (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 17 ), and thus it cannot be identical with the phrourion near Smyrna referred to in Steph. Byz. 158 . 12 ( pace Hirschfeld ( 1894 )). According to Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 17 , in 398 Achilleion was in a position to supply contingents of armed forces. Nothing further is known about this community."
837,Airai (Airaios),Ionia,38.1,26.4,670,3108,"837 . Airai (Airaios) Map 56 . Lat. 38 . 10 , long. 26 . 40 . Size of territory: unknown but probably 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Αιραί , αιasper (Thuc. 8 . 20 . 2 ). Note that at Thuc. 8 . 19 . 4 Αιasperράς in OCT is an emendation of MSS ' Εράς (without any indication of the MSS reading in the app. crit. ). At Ps.-Skylax 98 Αιραί is a possible conjecture of MSS Αacuteγρα , but the text is too corrupt to allow firm conclusions. The city-ethnic is Αιραιευacuteς ( PEP Teos 235 = BCH 4 ( 1880 ) 175 -76 no. 35 (undated); IG i³ 270 . i . 13 ( 442 / 1 )) or h αιραιευacuteς ( IG i³ 282 . iv . 44 -45 ( 429 / 8 )) or h αιραῖος ( IG i³ 260 . ix . 2 ( 453 / 2 )) or Αιραῖος ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 25 ( 454 / 3 ); Imhoof-Blumer ( 1902 ) 512 ). Airai is called a polis both in the urban sense (Thuc. 8 . 20 . 2 ) and in the political sense ( PEP Teos 268 . 7 = BPW ( 1892 ) 739 no. 11 (C4 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a Teian inscription ( PEP Teos 235 = BCH 4 ( 1880 ) 175 -76 no. 35 (undated)), and on C4 coins ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists and assessment decrees ( infra ). Airai was undoubtedly a community that was predominantly Greek.We possess no information relating to its foundation; but Wilamowitz-Möllendorff ( 1908 ) 617 inferred from the Greek name of the settlement (presumably from the weed αῖρα , ζιζάνιον ) that Airai was a relatively recent foundation. Airai was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 25 ) to 427 / 6 or 426 / 5 ( IG i³ 284 . 5 ) a total of fifteen times,paying a phoros of 3 tal. down to 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 52 ) and thereafter 1 tal. ( IG i³ 266 . i . 12 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 136 ). It revolted in 411 (Thuc. 8 . 19 . 4 ), and an Athenian attempt to reconquer the city failed (Thuc. 8 . 20 . 2 ). Although Airai was a Teian dependency in Strabo's day ( 14 . 1 . 32 ), there is no information relating to its status in the Classical period. Two surviving public enactments were passed by Airai: PEP Teos 28 = ÖJhBeibl 15 ( 1912 ) 75 -76 no. 15 may be a fragment of a C5 honorific decree, while PEP Teos 268 is an honorific decree passed in C4 and our most important source for the political institutions of Airai in C4 : the honorand is granted privileged access to the courts ([ δίκα ] ς προδίκους ) and access ( έφοδον ) to the ekklesia (ll. 2 -3 ), and he and his descendants are given dining rights in the prytaneion on public festival days (ll. 9 -12 ). The inscription may also provide evidence that there were free noncitizens resident in Airai in C4 (ll. 4 -5 ), and that ownership of real property was restricted to the citizens of Airai ( 7 -9 ). Meriç ( 1987 ) 303 with plan 2 on p. 306 reports on a survey at the site (Urla). The surface pottery is said to date from late Geometric to C4e, and there was a fortification wall around the peninsular site. Airai struck bronze coins in C4 . Types: obv . Apollo with wreath; rev . owl; legend: ΑΙΡΑΙΩΝ (Imhoof-Blumer ( 1902 ) 512 )."
838,Anaia (Anaites),Ionia,37.5,27.15,700,3564,"838 . Anaia (Anaites) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 50 , long. 27 . 15 . Size of territory: unknown but probably 1 or 2 . Type: C. The toponym is Αacuteναια , τά (Thuc. 4 . 75 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 98 ; IG xii . 6 43 . 11 (C4l)), Αναία , ηasper (Paus. 7 . 4 . 3 ). The city-ethnic(?) is Αναιιdieresisacuteτης (Thuc. 3 . 19 ). For possible polis status, see infra . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Thuc. 3 . 19 . 2 ( 428 / 7 ) and allegedly in CID ii 6 . 2 ([ Αν ] αιῖται απ ' ' Ιωνί [ ας ] ( 358 ); see infra ). According to Maiandros of Miletos ( FGrHist 491 ) fr. 1 , Samos (no. 864 ) received Anaia as a dependency from Kolophon (no. 848 ) in the wake of the Meliac War ( c. 700 ), and it remained a part of the Samian peraia in the Classical and Heltic periods (Ps.-Skylax 98 ). It is hard to decide if Anaia was a dependent polis whose citizens had a communal identity distinct from that of the Samians. At 3 . 19 . 2 Thucydides uses the collective city-ethnic in a reference to a military action by the Anaiitai ( επιθε µ ένων τῶν Καρῶν καιgrave Αναιιτῶν ). Conventionally the Anaiitai of Thuc. 3 . 19 . 2 are identified with the exiled Samian oligarchs who supported the Peloponnesians from their base at Anaia (e.g. Robert ( 1959 ) 21 ; Shipley ( 1987 ) 35 ; Hornblower ( 1991 ) 405 ). There can be little doubt that this splinter community would still perceive itself as Samian (Thuc. 3 . 32 . 2 , 4 . 75 . 1 ). The same probably applies to Thucydides' mention of an Anaiitan warship in 8 . 61 . 2 ( µ ία Αναιιdieresisacuteτις ), which assisted Leon of Sparta at the battle of Chios in 411 . The ship was presumably provided by the Samian exiles, and Thucydides may have used the adjective in order to avoid the possible misunderstanding that the ship was provided by the Samians on the island. Barron identifies two Samian silver coin types that were probably struck at Anaia during this period.One type carries the legend Α , which,as Barron suggests ( 1966 ) 93 , may be the initial of Α ( ΝΑΙΙΤΩΝ ), while the other has the legend ΕΠΙ ΒΑΤΙΟΣ . According to Barron ( 1966 ) 92 , Batis may have been either the leader of the oligarchic faction or an overseer appointed by Pissouthnes. By the terms of the Peace of Antalkidas in 386 , Samos was outside the sphere of influence of the Persian king, while her peraia was defined as part of Persian territory. The implications for the political relationship between Samos and the settlements on the mainland cannot be ascertained. If the Persians insisted on control of the former peraia of Samos for taxation purposes only, this may not have prevented Samos from maintaining political ties with its former possessions. A continuation of Samian involvement on the mainland may explain how the Samians could settle at Anaia after their expulsion from their island by the Athenians in 365 (see most recently Hallof and Habicht ( 1995 )). It has been suggested by Fantasia ( 1986 ), primarily on the basis of CID ii 6 A. 1 : [ Αν ] αιῖται απ ' ' Ιωνί [ ας ]), that the inhabitants of Anaia from 365 to 322 / 1 no longer regarded themselves as Samian citizens.However,an alternative reading of CID ii 6 is [ ' Ελ ] αιῖται (i.e. the city-ethnic of Elaia (no. 807 ) in Aiolis), if απ ' Ιωνί [ ας ] was used in the general sense of 'Asia Minor' rather than in the narrow sense of 'Ionia' . The fragile connection between Samos and its peraia seems to be a recurrent theme in the history of the island. See most recently Hallof and Mileta ( 1997 ) and Schuler ( 1998 ) 177 -79 for the Heltic period."
839,Boutheia (Boutheieus),Ionia,38.2,26.2,449,2133,"839 . Boutheia (Boutheieus) Map 56 . Lat. 38 . 20 , long. 26 . 20 . Size of territory: ? Type: B. The toponym is Βουacuteθεια , ηasper ( IG i³ 270 . i . 27 ( 442 / 1 )) or Βουθία (Steph. Byz. 180 . 17 ). The city-ethnic is Βουθειευacuteς ( IG i³ 259 . v . 19 ( 454 / 3 )). Boutheia is called a χωρίον by Theopomp. fr. 369 , but this designation does not rule out that Boutheia was indeed a polis , as its membership of the Delian League suggests that it was. The collective and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ). Boutheia cannot be located with precision, and several sites in the Erythraia have been suggested as likely candidates. Now that the existence of an Archaic temple of Athena (part of which can be dated back to C8 ) has been confirmed at Ildir, the site of Classical Erythrai, the hypothesis that the site at Ilıca contained Archaic Erythrai must be abandoned (Mitchell ( 1985 ) 83 ). Ilıca, then, must be another potential location of Archaic and Classical Boutheia; but it may equally well have housed one of the four other sites known to have formed part of the Erythraian syntely (cf. Erythrai (no. 845 )). Only numismatic and/or epigraphical evidence found in situ can provide a conclusive answer. Boutheia was a member of the Delian League.It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . v . 19 ) to 427 / 6 or 426 / 5 ( IG i³ 284 . 1 ) a total of fourteen times,five times completely but plausibly restored.In 430 / 29 Boutheia is explicitly recorded as a dependency of Erythrai ( IG i³ 281 . i . 20 : [ Βουθει ] ˜ ες ' Ερυθραίον ). In 453 / 2 the Boutheieis paid 3 tal. ( IG i³ 260 . x . 5 ). In 450 / 49 , 448 / 7 and 447 / 6 they paid alongside the other dependencies of Erythrai; they all formed a syntely, but the Boutheieis paid on their own behalf ( IG i³ 259 . v . 19 , 260 . x . 5 , 263 . ii . 17 , 264 . iii . 30 , 265 . i . 62 ). In later years their payment is recorded separately from that of the other Erythraian dependencies, and they seem in all years to have paid 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 17 , 283 . iii . 29 )."

Size of territory: 5 (the island itself is 826 . 5 km ² , to which the Chian peraia and the Oinoussai islands should be added). Type: A. The toponym is Χίος , ηasper (Hdt. 5 . 98 . 4 ; Aen. Tact. 11 . 3 ). The city-ethnic is Χῖος (Hdt. 1 . 18 . 3 ; IG ii² 43 A. 24 ( 378 / 7 )). Chios is called a polis in the urban sense (Hecat. fr. 141 ; Hdt. 6 . 27 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 3 ; PEP Chios 76 = Koerner ( 1993 ) 62 .B. 10 -12 (C5 ), as opposed to chora ; Aen. Tact. 11 . 4 ) and in the political sense (Hdt. 6 . 27 . 1 ; Thuc. 8 . 6 . 4 ; Ar.

Polis in the territorial sense is attested in Kritias fr. 2 . 7 , DK, and Tod 192 . 16 ( 332 / 1 ). Polites is applied to the citizens in Isoc. 8 . 98 . Politeia is used in the sense of citizenship in PEP Chios 12 . 27 ( c. 320 ), and in the sense of constitution in Ath. Pol . 24 . 2 (rC5 ). The word politeuma in the sense of constitution is used in Tod 192 . 3 ( 332 / 1 ), in which Alexander the Great prescribes that the Chian constitution is to be democratic. The asty of Chios is referred to in I.Délos 9 . 3 = SEG 19 510 , 33 . 633 (C6 ) and PEP Chios 78 . 2 (C4 ); and in Hdt. 6 . 15 . 1 the citizens are called astoi . In IG ii² 10510 . 7 (cf. CEG ii 606 (C4 )) Chios is the patris of Symmachos, son of Simon.The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in PEP Chios 12 . 23 ( c. 320 ) and externally in literature (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 4 ; Arist. Pol . 1303 a 34 ) and in inscriptions (Tod 118 . 16 -17 ( 384 ); IG ii² 43 A. 24 ( 378 / 7 )). The individual use is found externally in IG ii³ 683 (C6 ); Hipponax fr. 30 . 2 , West (C6 -C5 ); Simon. fr. 19 . 1 , West; SEG 36 50 . 2 ( 490 -480 ); and IG iv² . 1 123 . 117 (C4 ). There is also one internal attestation of the individual use of the city-ethnic ( PEP Chios 266 . 2 (C3l/C2e)). The territory of Chios is referred to as ηasper Χίη χώρη in Hdt. 6 . 26 . 1 . The names of several locations, some of which may have been second-order settlements in C5 , are known from epigraphical and literary sources: Koila, which according to Hdt. 6 . 26 . 1 contained a Chian garrison in 494 ; Kardamyle (Thuc. 8 . 24 . 3 ); Boliskos (Thuc. 8 . 24 . 3 ; Ephor. fr. 103 ); Phanai (Thuc. 8 . 24 . 3 ); and Leukonion (Thuc. 8 . 24 . 3 ). Delphinion, a site with more than one harbour on the coast just north of the urban centre of Chios, was fortified by the Athenians in 412 / 11 (Thuc. 8 . 38 . 2 ), and traces of the C5fortification on the top of a small acropolis were reported by Boardman ( 1956 ) 41 -49 . The site is also mentioned in PEP Chios 75 = BCH 3 ( 1879 ) 242 -55 a 8 (C5 -C4 ). PEP Chios 76 = BCH 3 ( 1879 ) 230 -41 ( 475 -450 ) mentions ' Ερ µ ώνοσσα (c. 2 , 4 ), ∆ήλιον (?) (c. 6 ), ∆οφῖτις (c. 9 ), [ Ε ] υάδαῖ (d. 17 -18 ), Κα µ ινήη ( sic !) (d. 20 ), Μελαῖνα Ακτή (d. 22 -23 ) and Οῖον (a. 11 -12 ). Section c of the inscription is concerned with the definition and preservation of official boundaries of the area ∆οφῖτις . It is clear from c. 9 -15 that the polis took an active interest in the preservation of these boundaries, but the nature of ∆οφῖτις as a locality is not quite clear. PEP Chios 75 = BCH 3 ( 1879 ) 242 -55 of C5 -C4 provides some more names: Ακταί (a. 22 , 32 , a sanctuary is located here), and Πάρβας (a. 34 , 36 -37 : an area that contained a swamp and a lake). For a more comprehensive overview of second-order settlements on the island, see further the gazetteer in Yalouris ( 1986 ) 143 -59 . The community at modern Emporio (which cannot be securely associated with any ancient toponym; see Boardman ( 1967 ) 254 -56 ) was a sizeable one. The Archaic settlement contained a walled acropolis dating from C7 (ibid. 4 -5 ), a harbour, at least two sanctuaries, and a residential area on the hill of Prophitis Elias of considerable density, estimated by Boardman to number more than fifty houses in an area of less than 0 . 04 km ² . The houses appear to have been abandoned in C7 , but there is evidence of Classical and Heltic occupation on the hill to the west of the Archaic settlement (ibid. 35 ). In addition to their territory on Chios itself, the Chians also controlled the islands of Oinoussai (Hecat. fr. 142 ; Hdt. 1 . 165 . 1 ; Thuc. 8 . 24 . 2 ). After Harpagos'attack on Phokaia (no. 859 ) c. 546 , the Phokaians approached the Chians with a view to purchasing and resettling in these islands; but according to Hdt. 1 . 165 . 1 , the Chians refused to sell because they feared the establishment of a rival emporion that might cut off their own island from trade.In 412 , the Athenians used the islands as a naval base for raids against Chios after the latter's secession from the Delian League.In Hdt. 6 . 26 . 2 a πολίχνη Χίων is mentioned, but it is not clear from the context if this site was located on Chios itself or if it was identical with Polichne on the Mimas peninsula, a settlement that had become an Erythraian dependency by C5m. In C6 Chios gained control of Atarneus (no. 803 ) in Aiolis in exchange for handing over the refugee Paktyes to the Persian king (Hdt. 1 . 160 . 3 -5 ). Chios still possessed Atarneus as part of its peraia as late as 398 / 7 (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 11 ); however,at that time the site was used as a base by Chian exiles. It is probable, though far from certain, that Chios lost its Asian peraia as a result of the King's Peace (Debord ( 1999 ) 264 -72 ). Chios appears to have lost control completely by the 360 s at the latest, when Atarneus had been taken over by Euboulos (Arist. Pol . 1267 a 31 -37 ), who was succeeded by Hermias as ruler of the place (note, however, Theopomp. fr. 291 , which may indicate that Hermias was originally installed by the Chians and the Mytilenaians (no. 798 ) as episkopos of the Chian and Lesbian peraiai , probably including Atarneus and its surroundings). All calculations of the size of the Chian citizen population are based on the size of the Chian fleet ( infra ) combined with very varying assumptions about the number of Chian citizens on board each ship (Roebuck ( 1986 ) 81 ; Walter ( 1993 ) 97 n. 37 ). See Thuc. 8 . 15 . 2 for evidence that the Chian slaves formed part of the crews in 412 (cf. Hunt ( 1998 ) 46 , 86 ). Chios is referred to by Thuc. 8 . 15 . 1 as being the largest of all the poleis that remained in the Athenian alliance in 412 , and in Thuc. 8 . 45 . 4 Alkibiades claims that the Chians were the wealthiest of all the Greeks. Chios appears to have been a strong naval power from very early on. Its contribution of 100 ships to the combined Ionian fleet in 494 was larger than that of any other polis involved, and there were forty picked citizen troops on board each ship (Hdt. 6 . 15 . 1 ). In 440 / 39 Chios and Lesbos together provided twenty-five ships for the Athenian war against Samos (no. 864 ) (Thuc. 1 . 116 . 2 ), while in 430 there were fifty Chian and Lesbian ships involved in the raids on the Peloponnese (Thuc. 2 . 56 . 2 ). Chian ships participated in the Pylos campaign in 425 (Thuc. 4 . 13 . 2 ), in the attack on Melos (no. 505 ) in 416 / 15 (Thuc. 5 . 84 . 1 ), and in the Sicilian expedition in 415 -413 (Thuc. 6 . 43 , 7 . 20 . 2 ). It may be inferred, e.g. from Thuc. 8 . 15 . 2 , that normally the Chians would themselves supply the crews for the ships participating in Athenian campaigns: after Chios' open revolt in 412 , the seven ships previously provided to Athens as a token of good faith (Thuc. 8 . 9 . 2 ) were no longer held to be trustworthy, and the free men on board (presumably Chians) were imprisoned, while the slave members of the crews were set free. When the Chians made their approach to the Spartans in 412 , they claimed to have at least sixty ships to contribute to their new alliance. The calculation of ship numbers in Gomme et al . ( 1981 ) 27 -32 suggests that the Chians may not have exaggerated. In C5l/C4e the organisation of the Chian armed forces comprised units called dekades : two inscriptions ( PEP Chios 61 and 62 ) record slaves enrolled in these units, and, in PEP Chios 62 , slaves who had been granted their freedom by the polis . Three Chian military commanders who had assisted the Spartans at Aigos Potamoi were honoured with statues at Delphi (Paus. 10 . 9 ). Chios was part of the Ionian dodekapolis (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 2 ), and Chian citizens participated in the Ionian arbitration between Myous (no. 856 ) and Miletos (no. 854 ) arranged by Strouses (Tod 113 . 17 ( 391 -388 )). In Thuc. 8 . 40 . 1 the Chians are made to characterise themselves as the 'largest of the allied poleis in Ionia' . Y et, perhaps because the Chians themselves regarded their city as a Euboian foundation quite separate from the other Ionian foundations on the Asiatic mainland, Chios' regional affiliation does not seem to have been selfexplanatory in Antiquity. In his work Χίου Κτίσις Ion of Chios ( FGrHist 392 ) fr. 1 relates how the Chian basileus Hektor, the great-grandson of Amphiklos of Histiaia, took the initiative to persuade the Chians to participate in the Panionia. Paus. 7 . 4 . 8 , having cited the passage, adds that Ion failed to explain why Chios was counted among the Ionian poleis (cf. Thuc. 8 . 6 . 2 : ες τηgraveν ' Ιωνίαν καιgrave Χίον ). Ion of Chios ( FGrHist 392 ) fr. 1 is our earliest source for the Chian version of its foundation by Oinopion, Melas and others, with a second wave of settlers under the leadership of Amphiklos of Histiaia in Euboia. That the foundation myth had an early origin is indicated by the designation of Chios as Μέλα [ ν ] ος Πατρώιον άστυ in I.Délos 9 . 3 ( 550 -500 ). In the Archaic period, Chios and Miletos supported each other as allies in at least two wars: Miletos backed Chios in its war against Erythrai (no. 845 ) ( terminus ante quem : c. 600 ), while the Chians returned the favour by aiding the Milesians against Alyattes of Lydia (Hdt. 1 . 18 . 3 ( c. 600 )). Chios appears to have escaped conquest by the Lydians and later the Persians right up until the aftermath of the Ionian Revolt in 493 , when the Persians attacked the island. An andrapodismos may be indicated in the account of how the Chians were 'netted' by the Persians (Hdt. 6 . 31 . 1 -2 ). According to Herodotos,the Chians had previously established a treaty of xenie with Kroisos (Hdt. 1 . 27 . 5 ), perhaps implying that Chios was not a dependent polis as such, although it probably operated under considerable political constraint from Lydia.After the Persian conquest of Lydia, the islands off the Ionian coast 'gave themselves up' to Kyros without a fight (Hdt. 1 . 169 . 2 ), and Chios probably continued as a dependent polis within the Persian Empire from this point. It is not known, however, if Chios was subject to the same Persian demands for tribute and troops as the Ionian poleis on the mainland (see e.g. Roebuck ( 1986 ) 86 ). From at least as early as 513 to 480 / 79 , Chios was ruled by the pro-Persian tyrant Strattis (Hdt. 4 . 138 . 2 , 8 . 132 . 2 ). Chios was one of the first poleis to join the Delian League after the battle of Mykale (Hdt. 9 . 106 . 4 ). As a contributor of ships rather than money,Chios remained autonomos (Thuc. 3 . 10 . 5 , 6 . 85 . 2 , 7 . 57 . 4 ), de jure at any rate, although Arist. Pol . 1284 a 39 -41 suggests that the de facto relationship was heavily dominated by Athens, to the extent that the terms of their alliance were actually broken by the Athenians.A bilateral treaty concerning access to judicial procedures in Athens between Chios and Athens, presumably with Chios as a subordinate party, may have been in force in C5m ( IG i² 10 . 10 -11 , but the restoration is very uncertain). Chios went over to the Peloponnesian side in 412 , and the Spartans established a military presence on the island as early as 412 / 11 , led by the Spartan nauarch Pedaritos (Thuc. 8 . 17 . 1 , 38 . 3 -4 ). Thuc. 8 . 38 . 3 -4 , along with the very fragmentary Hell. Oxy. 5 , Chambers, suggests that Pedaritos was heavyhanded in his interference in internal Chian affairs. That the Spartan involvement in Chios continued to compromise Chian autonomy is indicated by the report in Diod. 13 . 65 . 3 -4 that the Spartan commander Kratesippidas restored Chian oligarchic exiles to the island and occupied the acropolis in 409 / 8 . Sparta's direct involvement in Chios continued for nearly a decade after the end of the Peloponnesian War,until the Chians expelled the Spartan garrison after the Athenian victory in the battle of Knidos in 394 (Diod. 14 . 84 . 3 ). Chios entered into alliance with Athens in 384 / 3 (Tod 118 ). The treaty appears to have been on equal terms, and Chian eleutheria and autonomia are guaranteed (ll. 19 -24 ). Although Diod. 15 . 26 . 3 may suggest that the Spartans managed to re-establish temporary control over the island after that point, this cannot be substantiated by any other evidence. In any case, Chios was a founding member of the Second Athenian Naval League from 378 / 7 ( IG ii² 43 . 24 and 79 = Tod 123 ). In 363 Epameinondas succeeded in winning over the Chians; but, according to Diod. 15 . 79 . 1 , his death shortly afterwards prevented the Thebans (no. 221 ) from consolidating their influence. Chios seceded from Athens again in 357 (Dem. 15 . 3 ; Diod. 16 . 7 . 3 ), when it formed an anti-Athenian alliance with Kos (no. 497 ), Byzantion (no. 674 ) and Rhodos (no. 1000 ), with further backing from Maussolos.From at least as early as 346 Chios fell within the Hekatomnid sphere of power. It is likely that a permanent Karian garrison was established by Idrieus, if not even earlier by Maussolos (Dem. 5 . 25 ; for a recent discussion of the numismatic evidence, on the basis of which it has been argued that the Karian presence was established already in the reign of Maussolos, see Debord ( 1999 ) 382 -83 ). A Makedonian garrison, maintained from Chian funds, was imposed by Alexander the Great ( PEP Chios 32 = SEG 35 925 ( 334 -330 )), along with a demand for twenty manned triremes paid for by the Chians. As noted above, there were numerous second-order settlements on Chios, and some of them were of considerable size. It has been argued that the formation of a centralised Chian polis with Chios town as its urban centre happened relatively late. ML 8 = PEP Chios 23 ( 600 -550 ) forms an important part of the argument.On the assumption that the text is indeed Chian, one interpretation of the boule demosie in ll. C. 5 -6 , manned by fifty representatives from each phyle (the number of which is unknown), is that the council served the purpose of uniting the different local communities in a single administrative and political structure (see recently Walter ( 1993 ) 94 and Nomima i 264 -66 with references to previous discussions). It cannot be ruled out that the peaceful abandonment of the settlement at Emporio c. 600 (Boardman ( 1967 ) 37 -38 ) was directly related to a process of centralisation, of which ML 8 may then represent a later stage. We may thus be dealing with an early form of synoecism. However, Yalouris' gazetteer ( 1986 ) contains at least eight second-order settlements with continued occupation during the Archaic and Classical periods ( iii . 8 -9 , 20 , iv . 5 -6 , v . 1 , 4 , vi . 4 ), so it is likely that a considerable part of the Chian population continued to reside outside the urban centre. Continuous occupation of the Chian urban centre up to modern times has prevented systematic excavation, which means that the process and level of Archaic/Classical urbanisation cannot be assessed on the basis of archaeological evidence. The modern reconstruction of early Chian political institutions is based on the inscription PEP Chios 23 = ML 8 ( 600 -550 ); but doubts concerning the origins of the inscription have been raised, and it cannot be ruled out that the inscription pertains to Erythrai (no. 845 ) (for a parallel example, see I.Erythrai 15 = PEP Chios 25 (C4m)). The text itself points to a constitution in which the assembly had a function as a legislative body (A. 1 -2 ), and it may also have had some judicial capacity (A. 7 ). The council ( boule demosie , C. 5 -6 ) appears to have had a probouleutic function in addition to a judicial one (C. 9 -14 ). There were ways of calling senior officials ( demarchoi and basileis ) to account (A. 3 -6 ), although the procedural details are not clear. The constitutional arrangements of Archaic Chios were probably disrupted by the ascent of the tyrant Strattis (before 513 to 480 / 79 ). In C5 until 412 , Chios appears to have had a moderate constitution which is not easily labelled as either a democracy or an oligarchy (O'Neill ( 1978 -79 )). There is no direct evidence for a Chian assembly in C5 , although Thuc. 8 . 9 . 3 may indicate that it did exist. PEP Chios 76 ( 475 -450 ) attests a board of officials called 'the Fifteen' who report to the boule (B. 1 -5 ). The Fifteen have the authority to impose fines on other officials (here the horophylakes , B. 15 -19 ). There is mention of a dicastic panel consisting of 300 unbribed men (B. 21 -25 ). The official designated basileus has as part of his task the pronouncing of public curses (D. 7 -9 ). It is not known if eligibility to serve as bouleutes , as an official, or as a judge was restricted by a property census or by other criteria in this period. Thucydides' account of the Chian revolt from Athens in 412 suggests that the boule had considerable scope for independent action: negotiations with the Peloponnesians had evidently been conducted without the consent of the broader population ( 8 . 9 . 3 ), and the citizens who were involved in planning the revolt were in a position to arrange that a meeting of the Chian boule would be in progress when the Spartans made their surprise arrival on the island ( 8 . 14 . 1 -2 ). The moderate Chian constitution was then replaced by a muchnarrower oligarchic one (Thuc. 8 . 38 . 4 ). Opposition to the new regime was crushed (Thuc. 8 . 24 . 6 , 38 . 3 ), and this constitution probably continued until 394 , except perhaps for a brief period between 410 and 409 / 8 (Piérart ( 1995 ) 268 -69 ). PEP Chios 2 (C5l/C4e) is a public enactment with the heading boules gnome (l. 2 ), while SEG 35 923 .B. 13 -26 (C5 -C4 ) is a law passed by the boule presided over by the basileis . There is no mention of an assembly in either inscription. There are no Chian public enactments that can be securely dated to the period between 394 and 355 , and we know very little about its political institutions (T od 118 . 33 -34 ( 384 ) probably referred to Chios' boule in addition to unspecified archai ). There is no decisive evidence to prove that the Chians reintroduced democracy in connection with their alliance with Athens ( pace Gehrke, Stasis 46 ). By 355 the Chian constitution was definitely oligarchic (Dem. 15 . 19 ), but it is not clear whether this was the result of a recent stasis . The abolition of an extreme oligarchic government in Chios, mentioned in Arist. Pol . 1306 b 3 -5 , may refer to the period around 394 or to constitutional upheavals in C4m,as argued by Gehrke, Stasis 46 . However, constitutional continuity may be suggested by the fact that the eponymous official is the prytanis throughout the Classical period ( PEP Chios 2 . 1 (C5 -C4 ), 75 .A. 20 (C4m), 80 . 23 -24 (C4s), 32 . 1 ( 334 -330 )); whereas the single prytanis had been replaced by a board of prytaneis by c. 320 , perhaps on an Athenian model ( PEP Chios 12 .A. 30 ). The restoration of the heading [ πρυτάνεων γν ] ώ µ η in SEG 35 923 .A. 1 ( c. 400 ) is disputed (Rhodes, DGS 230 ). When Alexander the Great decreed in 334 -330 that the Chian constitution was to be democratic, a fundamental revision of Chian legislation ( nomoi , PEP Chios 32 . 5 ) was deemed necessary ( PEP Chios 32 . 4 -6 ). The institutions attested in PEP Chios 12 ( c. 320 ) were undoubtedly the result of these reforms. The psephisma (A. 43 ) was passed by a popular assembly (A. 1 : έδοξε τῶι δή µ ωι ), and the magistrates mentioned in the decree, with the exception of the agonothetes (A. 29 ), were serving as members of boards ( prytaneis , A. 30 ; tamiai , A. 33 ; exetastai , A. 37 ). The best evidence for the judicial system in C5 is provided by PEP Chios 76 ( 475 -450 ). Impending court cases (perhaps concerning disputed property) were to be announced by kerykes in the countryside as well as the urban centre (B. 5 -20 ), and the penalties of fines and atimia are also attested here (C. 14 -15 ). The polis appears to have assumed responsibility for conducting cases on behalf of individuals who have been evicted from their property (D. 1 -5 ). Dikai prodikoi are granted to two teams of foreign judges in PEP Chios 12 A. 16 -17 ( c. 320 ). Taxes payable to the polis and to a local settlement ( Οίη ) are attested in PEP Chios 75 B. 45 -46 (C4m). Total ateleia is granted to a priestess in PEP Chios 6 . 11 -12 (C4 ), while limited ateleia from import and export taxes is granted in PEP Chios 12 A. 17 -18 ( c. 320 ). Free foreigners are subject to special charges in connection with the sacrifices regulated in PEP Chios 78 . 12 -13 (C4 ). For a list of free foreigners attested epigraphically, see Sarikakis ( 1986 ) 130 -31 . Chian envoys were sent to Lakedaimon (no. 345 ) in 413 / 12 (Thuc. 8 . 4 -6 . 1 ), to Astyochos in 412 / 11 (Thuc. 8 . 40 . 1 ) and to Athens (no. 361 ) in 384 / 3 (Tod 118 . 13 ). Chian citizens received proxenia from Athens ( IG ii² 23 ( 388 / 7 )) and Anaphe (no. 474 ) (Michel 662 . 17 -18 (C4 )). Chios bestowed proxenia and citizenship on a group of foreign judges from Naxos (no. 507 ) and Andros (no. 475 ) ( PEP Chios 12 . 17 -19 , 27 ). PEP Chios 50 is conventionally interpreted as a C4m list of Chios' proxenoi in different communities (at least fifteen); cf. PEP Chios 12 = SEG 12 390 . 31 -32 : τηgraveν στήλην τηgraveν προξενικήν . Chian theorodokoi hosted theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) c. 330 -324 ( SEG 23 189 . ii . 4 ) and theoroi announcing the Nemean Games ( SEG 36 331 . ii . 46 -49 ( 323 / 2 )). The Chians were given promanteia in Delphi ( F.Delphes iii . 3 213 (C4 -C3 )); and in C5e they sent a chorus of 100 young men (Hdt. 6 . 27 . 2 ). For the altar of Apollo dedicated by the Chians, see Hdt. 2 . 135 . 4 and F.Delphes iii . 3 212 (after 480 ). Xenopeithes of Chios was victorious at Olympia in 480 (Moretti ( 1970 ) 296 ). The system of civic subdivisions underwent more than one radical reform during the Classical period. There was a phyle structure attested perhaps as early as C6f (assuming that PEP Chios 23 .C. 8 -9 = ML 8 relates to Chios); but there is as yet no attestation of the traditional six Ionian phylai (Piérart ( 1985 ) 182 ). Jones, POAG 191 -93 argues for a threetier structure in C5 -C4e, tentatively identifying the groups as phylai , phratries ( PEP Chios 80 . 28 (C4m)) and gene ( PEP Chios 7 . 2 (C4m)).It was assumed by Forrest ( 1960 ), followed by Jones, POAG 194 and Piérart ( 1985 ) 181 -82 , that the threetier structure was replaced by a more complex system with four tiers in C4s. In this system the phylai consisted of numbered subdivisions ( πρῶτοι , δευacuteτεροι , τρίτοι ). These subdivisions were in turn further subdivided into units designated by numbers ( Α , Β , Γ , etc.), each of which were subdivided into groups designated by a 'patronymic' .While the groups designated by numbers and 'patronymic' are well attested in C4l ( PEP Chios 71 , 72 , 73 ( c. 315 )) and occupy an uncontroversial place in the hierarchy of subdivisions, it is more problematic to identify the named subdivisions in C5 and C4f as either phylai , phratries or gene . Some groups, such as the Kaukaseis ( PEP Chios 8 ( 450 -425 )) and the Klytidai ( PEP Chios 75 (C4m)),had complex administrative and political structures; but it is still uncertain if these groups belonged in the uppermost tier as phylai or at a lower level as phratries. The mention of Zeus Patroios in a decree passed by the Klytidai ( PEP Chios 80 . 35 (C4s)) has led some to suggest that the group was indeed a phratry (for a summary of the debate, see Graf ( 1985 ) 36 -37 ); but nothing can be concluded with certainty.It may be suggested on the basis of PEP Chios 75 . 11 -12 and 29 that the Klytidai had originally been a territorially based unit, perhaps centred on a secondorder settlement ( 45 -46 : Οίη ), not unlike the Kleisthenic demes. The same may be true of the Kaukaseis (Hdt. 5 . 33 . 1 mentions Καυacuteκασα , a location on the coast). For this interpretation, see Graf ( 1985 ) 35 pace Forrest ( 1960 ) 188 , who believed that the Kaukaseis derived their name from Kaukasos, the companion of Chios' mythical founder Oinopion. PEP Chios 9 (C4 -C3 ) allows the interpretation that admission of the next generation of Chians to the citizen body was controlled locally in the civic subdivisions. The text is a list of members of the Totteidai (perhaps a phratry) who have been admitted to the agogaia . Chios was exposed to numerous outbreaks of stasis and, consequently, exiles are frequently mentioned in the sources. Arist. Pol . 1303 a 34 -35 refers to Chian exiles in Antissa (no. 794 ) in Lesbos, who were later expelled by the Antissaians because of the threat that they posed. Unfortunately the event cannot be dated.Hdt. 8 . 132 . 2 relates how six conspirators against the tyrant Strattis fled the island in 480 / 79 after their assassination plans had been revealed. The defection of Chios from Athens in 412 was the result of rivalry between οιasper πολλοί and οιasper ολίγοι (Thuc. 8 . 9 . 3 , 14 . 2 ), and we hear of Chian exiles once again after the Chians had sided with the Peloponnesians. A party of proSpartan oligarchic exiles was restored to the island by the Spartan commander Kratesippidas in 409 / 8 (Diod. 13 . 65 . 3 -4 ). If Piérart's ( 1995 ) interpretation and dating of SEG 39 370 are correct, the exiles mentioned in the inscription as 'friends of Sparta' are identical with the exiles in Diod. 13 . 65 . 3 -4 . According to Piérart, the members of the extreme oligarchic regime set up by Pedaritos were expelled by the Chians, who were taking advantage of the reversal of Spartan fortunes after the Athenian victory at Kyzikos in 410 . When Kratesippidas had succeeded in bringing the proSpartan exiles back to the island, they in turn exiled 600 of their opponents, and the latter set up base at Atarneus. According to Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 11 , the second group of exiles still occupied the Chian peraia in 398 . The letter of Alexander the Great to the Chians ( PEP Chios 32 = SEG 35 925 ( 334 -330 )) stipulated that Chian exiles were to be allowed to return (l. 2 ): these exiles were undoubtedly of democratic or antiPersian orientation (or both), and may have been forced out in the wake of constitutional upheavals in C4m (see Dem. 15 . 19 ). In the same letter Alexander instructed the Chians to impose exile on Medising citizens (ll. 11 -12 ). Although excavations of individual plots in Chios town have uncovered parts of the ancient agora, we depend almost exclusively on literary evidence for the identification of major civic structures in the urban centre. Ps.Skylax 99 mentions the harbour. Aen. Tact. 11 . 3 -5 provides evidence for dockyards, a stoa and a tower near the harbour, but the date of the event related in this passage is uncertain. A sanctuary of Athena Poliouchos is attested in Hdt. 1 . 160 . 3 (rC6 ). Aen. Tact. 17 . 5 refers to the Chian agora (C4 ). A festival of Dionysos is attested in Aen. Tact. 17 . 5 and PEP Chios 12 A 22 ( c. 320 ), which involved a procession to his altar, perhaps located in the agora. For a comprehensive discussion of cults and cult sites on the island, see Graf ( 1985 ) 22 -146 . The Chian calendar included some Attic months, e.g. Posideon ( PEP Chios 80 . 23 (C4 )), but also the month Leukatheon ( PEP Chios 75 A 25 (C5 -C4 )), which is peculiar to the Ionian cities in Asia Minor (Graf ( 1985 ) 18 -21 ; Trümpy, Monat . 102 -5 ). In 425 / 4 the Athenians ordered the Chians to tear down their new wall in order to deter them from revolting (Thuc. 4 . 51 ); it is not clear whether this wall was just an addition to existing fortifications or whether Chios had been unfortified before this time. In 412 / 11 the Athenians besieged its urban centre in vain, and it is highly likely that it was protected by walls (Thuc. 8 . 38 . 3 , 40 . 1 , 56 . 1 , 61 . 3 ). Aen. Tact. 11 . 6 provides further evidence for city walls, but the date cannot be ascertained. Chios struck coins on the Chian standard ( 15 . 6 g) from c. 550 . The earliest attested issue is an electrum hekte . Types: obv . sphinx; rev . four-part incuse square (anepigraphic). There was simultaneous minting of silver and electrum staters 525 -510 . Hardwick ( 1993 ) 213 suggests that the silver staters were issued c. 525 -493 , and that the series may have been discontinued after the Persian attack on the island in 493 . A second series of silver staters was issued c. 490 -435 : obv . sphinx and amphora; rev . four-part incuse square (anepigraphic). From 435 -425 : obv . sphinx, amphora and grapes; rev . four-part incuse square (anepigraphic). Hardwick ( 1993 ) 216 argues for a break in the minting of silver staters 425 -412 . A unique electrum stater is dated by Hardwick to the period immediately after the revolt of 412 : obv . sphinx, amphora and wreath; rev . four-part incuse square (anepigraphic). There is a corresponding silver tetradrachm to which Hardwick assigns the same date. From the last decade of C5 to c. 330 silver tetradrachms and fractions were issued continuously: obv . sphinx and amphora; rev . four-part incuse square; legend: sometimes magistrate's name or anepigraphic.Chios also struck bronze coins i...

The toponym is Χυτόν , τό ( I.Erythrai 502 . 9 -10 = Tod 114 ( 387 / 6 ); Ephor. fr. 78 ). Chyton is probably identical with the Chytron mentioned by Arist. Pol . 1303 b 9 , and ΧυτΩsubiotaῶ is an almost universally accepted conjecture for MSS χυacuteτρΩsubiotaω . The reason for recording Chyton in this Inventory is Aristotle's information that Chyton and Klazomenai (no. 847 ) tended to break up into two political communities like Kolophon (no. 848 ) and Notion (no. 858 ), which in some periods were split up into two poleis . According to Strabo 14 . 1 . 36 , Chyton was located on the site of Old Klazomenai, which was later moved to an island connected with the mainland by a causeway. It is perfectly conceivable that habitation may have continued on the site of Klazomenai's former urban centre. Recent excavations conducted by G. Bakır and his team show that the C6mainland site was indeed abandoned after 494 , but that habitation resumed around 400 (Mellink ( 1984 )). The results of later excavations placed the date of abandonment of the Archaic settlement further back, in the 550 s and 540 s (Mellink ( 1992 ) 142 ). Excavation of C4 houses on the mainland site revealed two phases: the first from c. 400 to 380 -370 , when these houses were ruined; the second phase from c. 370 -330 (Mellink ( 1987 ) 23 ). The chronology of the mainland settlement corresponds quite well to the little that can be gleaned from literary and epigraphical sources for the history of Chyton in C4 ; and Strabo's identification of this settlement with Old Klazomenai thus seems to be confirmed. Chyton presents problems akin to those relating to Anaia (no. 838 ). Although part of Klazomenian territory, it constituted a considerable 'nuisance factor' like other peraiai (Hornblower ( 1991 ) 405 ) in that it provided a haven for citizens dissatisfied with the constitutional set-up of their city (Gehrke, Stasis 78 -79 ). The decree I.Erythrai 502 = Tod 114 , passed by Athens in 387 , promised Athenian non-intervention in a conflict between the Klazomenians and τουgraveς επιgrave ΧυτΩsubiotaῶ (l. 9 ). The Klazomenians were given full authority in matters regarding a peace settlement with the people at Chyton (ll. 8 -9 ), some of whom were held as hostages by the Klazomenians (ll. 9 -10 ). It is perhaps significant that no city-ethnic derived from the name of the locality Chyton is used in this document: the conflict is viewed as an internal conflict within the community of Klazomenai rather than a war between two poleis . We do not know how the people of Chyton would have preferred to represent themselves; but it should be noted that Arist.

The toponym is ∆ιοgraveς ' Ιερόν , τό (Thuc. 8 . 19 . 2 ; IG i³ 65 . 12 ( 427 / 6 )). The city-ethnic is ∆ιοσιρίτης ( IG i³ 37 . 27 (C5 )) or ∆ιοσερίτης ( IG i³ 289 . i . 42 ). Dios Hieron is not attested as a polis in any Archaic or Classical source, but the collective use of the city-ethnic is attested in an external context in IG i³ 37 . 27 (C5 ) and in the Athenian tribute lists ( infra ). Dios Hieron was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 23 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 42 ) a total of fourteen times,paying a phoros first of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 23 ) from 442 / 1 of 500 dr. ( IG i³ 270 . i . 4 ). It is often listed together with Kolophon (no. 848 ) (five times) and/or Notion (no. 858 ) (six times) ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 21 -23 , 289 . i . 40 -42 ; Piérart ( 1984 ) 171 n. 49 ). An Athenian decree of 427 / 6 honouring a citizen of Kolophon indicates that at this point Dios Hieron (called a chorion ) was dependent on Kolophon ( IG i³ 65 . 11 -14 ). However, as dated and restored, another decree of C5mentions the citizens of Dios Hieron on a par with the citizens of Kolophon and Lebedos (no. 850 ), and all three cities are to cover the travelling costs and daily expenses of five elected oikistai to be sent out from Athens ( IG i³ 37 . 27 ). So far, we have no evidence for Dios Hieron in C4 ; but its reappearance as a community in its own right in the Heltic period ( SEG 39 1244 . i . 22 ; Head, HN ² 650 ) may serve as an indication in favour of its continued existence as a polis in C4 ."
843,(Elaiousioi),Ionia,,,282,1325,"843 . (Elaiousioi) Map 56 . Unlocated. Type: B. The toponym is not attested in the Classical period; but it was probably ' Ελαιουtildeσσα , derived from the city-ethnic ' Ελαιόσιοι , attested in the Athenian tribute lists. Engelmann and Merkelbach ( 1972 ) 37 , followed by Barr ., reject the identification with the island ' Ελεουtildeσσα mentioned by Strabo 13 . 1 . 67 and note that many Greek communities derived their name from their olive trees. The Elaiousioi were members of the Delian League. They belonged to the Ionian district and are recorded from 448 / 7 ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 30 ) to 427 / 6 or 426 / 5 ( IG i³ 284 . 2 -3 ) a total of eleven times, five times completely but plausibly restored. Elaious is explicitly recorded as a dependency of Erythrai ( ' Ελαιόσιοι ' Ερυθραίον ) in two lists ( IG i³ 281 . i . 22 , 284 . 2 ) and in the assessment of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 151 -52 ). In 448 / 7 and 447 / 6 they paid alongside the other dependencies of Erythrai (no. 845 ); they all formed a syntely, but the Elaiousioi paid on their own behalf ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 30 , 265 . i . 63 ). In later years their payment is recorded separately from that of the other Erythraian dependencies. They paid 100 dr.( IG i³ 268 . i . 28 ) and were assessed at a phoros of 100 dr. in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 151 -52 )."
844,Ephesos (Ephesios),Ionia,37.55,27.15,2964,14849,"844 . Ephesos (Ephesios) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 55 , long. 27 . 15 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A. The toponym is /acuteΕφεσος , ηasper (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 ; Thuc. 1 . 137 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 4 . 16 ; Ps.-Skylax 98 ). The city-ethnic is ' Εφέσιος (Hdt. 1 . 147 . 2 ; I.Ephesos 2 . 9 (C4 )). In C6Ephesos is called a polis as citadel ( akropolis ) in I.Ephesos 1 A. 1 , and in the urban sense in C6 -C5 (Hipponax fr. 50 . 1 , West). In C5 it is called a polis in the urban sense (Hdt. 1 . 26 . 2 (rC6 )) and in the political sense (Hdt. 1 . 141 . 4 , 142 . 3 -4 , 143 . 3 ; Herakleitos fr. 121 , DK). In C4 it is called polis in the urban sense ( Hell. Oxy . 1 . 2 , Chambers; Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 7 -8 ) and in the territorial sense in I.Ephesos 1420 . 4 (C4 ), in which citizenship is granted on the condition that the honorands remain εν τηsubiotaηtilde πόλει . For polis in the political sense, see IG ii² 8523 . 4 ; I.Ephesos 2 . 4 (C4 ); SEG 39 1151 . 2 . The urban centre is called polisma by Kreophylos of Ephesos ( FGrHist 417 ) fr. 1 ( c. 400 ?). The polis cognate polites is applied to the citizens of Ephesos in I.Ephesos 1419 . 3 and 1420 . 4 (both C4 ). The word politeia is used in the sense of citizenship in Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 10 ; I.Ephesos 1421 . 3 (C4 ). Ephesos was the patris of Pythokles, who was brought up and lived in Athens, and who was commemorated by a funerary epigram ( IG ii² 8523 . 4 (C4e); cf. CEG ii 485 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Hdt. 1 . 147 . 2 ; IG ii² 1 . 48 = Tod 97 . 8 ( 403 / 2 ); IG ii² 1485 . ii . 9 (C4l), and internally in I.Ephesos 2 . 9 and 1427 . 2 (both C4 ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Hdt. 9 . 84 . 2 ; ML 95 e ( 405 ); SEG 17 111 (C4 ). The name of the territory is ' Εφεσίη (Hdt. 5 . 100 , 6 . 16 . 2 ; I.Priene 3 . 13 (probably C3 )) or ' Εφεσία (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 14 ). It included the location Koressos on the coast (Hdt. 5 . 100 ); cf. infra . There was a suburb called Smyrna 'behind the polis ' ( όπισθε τηtildeς πόλιος ), as mentioned by Hipponax fr. 50 . 1 , West, cf. infra . Priene (no. 861 ) had a common border with Ephesos,presumably to the north-west ( I.Priene 3 . 12 -14 ). In Xen. Hell . 1 . 5 . 12 , 15 there are references to an unspecified λι µ ηgraveν τῶν ' Εφεσίων (presumably the city harbour is meant). The location of the harbour Panormos mentioned in Strabo 14 . 1 . 20 cannot be determined with certainty (Meriç ( 1985 )). Ephesian Smyrna has been located beneath the agora of the Lysimachean city by Langmann ( 1993 ), whose identification has been accepted e.g. by Engelmann ( 1990 ) 281 -82 . The houses excavated on this site date from C8 and C7 (Karwiese et al . ( 1996 ) 12 ). Langmann ( 1993 ) suggests that the site was inhabited by Smyrnaian merchants. Koressos is mentioned in Hdt. 5 . 100 and Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 7 -10 ; and it is referred to as a λι µ ήν in Hell. Oxy . 1 . 1 , Chambers. Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 7 reports that Thrasyllos landed his hoplite forces προgraveς τοgraveν Κορησσόν and that it was located on the opposite side of Ephesos' urban centre from the swamp. Robert ( 1960 ) 139 -44 argued, partly e silentio , that Koressos was an integral part of Ephesos rather than a polis in its own right. He dismissed the identification of this Koressos with the community that passed the C3 honorific decree published in ibid. 132 -34 . For the problems related to the precise location of Koressos, see Knibbe ( 1998 ) 76 . According to Ephor. fr. 126 , Ephesos was founded by Proklos. Shortly after its foundation it became involved in a war against Priene in which most of the Ephesian citizens were killed. In connection with a rebellion against the descendants of Androklos, the remaining Ephesians invited citizens from Karene (no. 813 ) and Teos (no. 868 ) to settle at Ephesos, and the newcomers gave their names to two of the Ephesian phylai . C. 555 -550 Ephesos entered into a treaty with Kroisos, presumably as a subordinate party (Polyaen. 6 . 50 ; Ael. VH 3 . 26 ; Staatsverträge 107 ). Ephesos belonged to the Ionian dodekapolis (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 ) and its citizens participated as judges in the arbitration between Miletos (no. 854 ) and Myous (no. 856 ) in 391 -388 (Tod 113 . 29 ). Ephesos was a member of the Delian League.It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . i . 22 , restored) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 26 ) a total of sixteen times, paying a phoros of 7½ tal. ( IG i³ 260 . vi . 13 ), from 445 / 4 reduced to 6 tal. ( IG i³ 267 . v . 17 ), but in 433 / 2 raised to 7½ tal. once again ( IG i³ 279 . i . 65 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 125 ). Ephesos revolted against the Athenians during the Ionian War or, at any rate, not earlier than 414 (Piérart ( 1995 ) 258 ), after which the Ephesians supported the Peloponnesian War effort ( SEG 39 370 . 23 ). After the Peloponnesian War Samian exiles were given asylum at Ephesos (Tod 97 . 8 ( 403 / 2 )). In 395 Agesilaos trained his army in the urban centre of Ephesos (Xen. Hell . 3 . 4 . 16 ); but it subsequently joined Konon after the battle of Knidos in 394 (Diod. 14 . 84 . 3 ). In 336 Ephesos sided with Parmenion and Attalos, but changed course again in 334 when citizens with oligarchic leanings joined forces with Memnon (Gehrke, Stasis 59 -60 ). For a survey of the history of the Ephesian constitution, see Gehrke, Stasis 57 -60 . The Aristotelian collection of constitutions included one of the Ephesians (Heracl. Lemb. 66 ; Arist. no. 49 ). Suda Α 3894 relates how Aristarchos of Athens was called to Ephesos to serve as ruler, and Gehrke, Stasis 57 suggests tentatively that he may have introduced a constitution resembling that of Solon's constitution at Athens. After a succession of pro-Persian tyrants, a democratic constitution was introduced in 492 (Herakleitos fr. 121 , DK),perhaps a radicalisation of a constitutional arrangement introduced by Mardonios in 494 . Hermodoros, a friend of Herakleitos, was exiled after the introduction of the constitutional change in 492 (Gehrke, Stasis 57 -58 ). Gehrke notes ( Stasis 58 ) that there is no evidence for any constitutional changes during the rest of C5 and most of C4 : the Ephesian revolt against the Athenians in C5l ( SEG 39 370 . 23 ) does not necessarily imply that the Ephesians had replaced their democracy with an oligarchic constitution (Piérart ( 1995 ) 258 thinks it unlikely that the Ephesians revolted any earlier than 414 / 13 ). Gehrke, Stasis 39 suggests that the regime following the King's Peace was of an oligarchic leaning, and that the Ephesian support of the Makedonians in 336 was driven primarily by democratic forces within the city. An oligarchic countermove occurred in 334 , when Memnon managed to gain control of Ephesos, replacing the democratic constitution with an oligarchy that lasted only until Alexander's victory at Granikos later in the same year (Arr. Anab . 1 . 17 . 10 ). The reintroduction of democracy was accompanied by a massacre of the oligarchs (Arr. Anab . 1 . 17 . 11 -12 ). Public enactments passed by the boule and the assembly are, e.g., SEG 39 1151 ( 326 / 5 -324 / 3 ); I.Ephesos 1419 and 1420 (both C4 ). A sacred law ( νό µ ος οasper πάτριος ) is mentioned in I.Ephesos 2 . 5 -6 (C4 ). In I.Ephesos 1420 . 1 -3 there is reference to a nomos which appears to be the budget of the city, designating sums to be spent on public works. I.Ephesos 2 records death sentences passed on between forty-four and forty-six persons who had molested a board of Ephesian theoroi sent to the sanctuary of Artemis at Sardis. The case was conducted by προήγοροι on behalf of the goddess Artemis ( 2 . 1 ). It is not clear from the text who had actually judged the case,and it has even been suggested that it was heard at Sardis (e.g. Masson ( 1987 ) 228 -29 ). The indictment which formed the basis of the trial is cited in the decree. In C4 the eponymous official was the πρυacuteτανις ( I.Ephesos 1421 . 3 -4 , 1425 . 2 , 1426 . 2 (all C4 )). The boule is attested in a probouleutic capacity in the preambles to numerous C4 decrees (e.g. I.Ephesos 1419 . 2 (C4 )), and was in charge of certain public works ( I.Ephesos 1420 . 5 (C4 )). The πρόεδροι ( I.Ephesos 1438 . 3 (C4 )) were responsible for assigning new citizens to phyle and chiliastys by lot. Other officials are the board of εσσηtildeνες ( I.Ephesos 1443 (C4e)), the αγωνοθέτης ( I.Ephesos 1440 . 11 (C4l)) and the board of νεωποῖαι ( I.Ephesos 1440 . 7 (C4l)). For the neokoros of the Ephesian Artemis, see Xen. An . 5 . 3 . 6 . The Ephesian assembly is attested in I.Ephesos 1389 . 1 , 1419 . 2 , 1420 . 3 , etc. (all C4 ). For Ephesian commanders and troops (hoplites), see Hell . Oxy . 2 . 1 , Chambers. Ephesian citizenship grants are attested in Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 10 (a block grant of citizenship given to the Selinuntians (no. 44 ) after successful defence of Ephesos against an Athenian attack in 409 ); and for C4 in I.Ephesos 1389 , 1408 -45 (mostly C4 , some C3 ), and SEG 39 1151 . 4 ( 326 / 5 -324 / 3 ). The civic subdivisions of Ephesos are known primarily from citizenship decrees,in which it is stipulated that the honorand be assigned to a phyle and a chiliastys : I.Ephesos 1421 . 6 (C4 ): έλαχε φυληgraveν Τήϊος , χιλιαστυν ' Εχεπτολέ µ ειος . According to Ephor. fr. 126 , there were five phylai at Ephesos: Bennaioi, Teioi, Karenaioi, Euonymoi and Ephesioi. Bennaioi is undoubtedly a false rendering of Bembineis. The phyle Ευωνυ µ εῖς is attested in I.Ephesos 1419 . 4 , Βε µ βινεῖς in I.Ephesos 1427 . 4 , ' Εφεσεῖς in I.Ephesos 1420 . 5 , Τήϊοι in I.Ephesos 1421 . 6 , and Καρηναῖοι in I.Ephesos 1415 . 17 (all C4 , 1415 as late as c. 300 (Rhodes, DGS 358 )). The epigraphical record provides the names and phyle affiliation of some fifty chiliastyes ; see Jones, POAG 312 . Ephesian embassies are attested epigraphically in I.Ephesos 1436 . 1 (C4 ) and I.Ephesos 1437 . 2 (before 321 ). In C4 the city granted proxenia to a citizen of Kyrene (no. 1028 ) ( I.Ephesos 1389 (C4 )) and to a Makedonian ( I.Ephesos 1433 . 2 -3 ). Between 325 and 275 , Monounios, son of Sophokles of Ephesos, was appointed proxenos by Delphi (no. 177 ). For a grant of enktesis , see I.Ephesos 1389 (C4l). Ephesian theoroi are attested in I.Ephesos 2 . 3 -4 , 10 = SEG 36 1011 ( c. 350 -300 ); for theorodokoi to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ), see SEG 23 189 . ii . 8 ( 330 -324 ). Although Hdt. 1 . 26 . 2 may suggest that the urban centre of Ephesos was moved at some point during C6 or C5 , this is not at all certain (see Özyigit ( 1988 ) 94 -96 ). Herodotos need not imply any more than that the urban centre had expanded considerably since C6 and that the Artemision thus was no longer situated 7 stades outside the city walls. So far, very little of the monumental architecture of Archaic and Classical Ephesos has been excavated. In addition to a temple of Meter Theon and a structure which was probably an Apollo sanctuary, the Artemision, perhaps the most important monument in the whole of Ephesos, has been uncovered and described (Bammer and Muss ( 1996 )). According to Hdt. 1 . 26 . 2 (rC6 ), the Artemis temple was situated 7 stades from the walls of the old urban centre. The foundation of the earliest temple has been dated to C8 . On the fire of the Archaic Artemision in C4m, see Knibbe ( 1998 ) 89 . He rejects the tradition of the mad pyromaniac Herostratos and offers a more plausible explanation: viz . that the foundations of the temple had been causing problems since the days of Kroisos and were slowly sinking. In addition the ground level was constantly rising because of alluvial deposits from the river Kaystros. The fire con- veniently made it possible to construct the late Classical Artemision on higher ground than its predecessor. For an account of C7 -C6finds in the Artemision, see Wiplinger and Wlach ( 1995 ) 107 -8 . τοgrave ιasperεροgraveν τηtildeς Αρτέ µ ιδος is mentioned in I.Ephesos 1438 . 4 (C4 ), from which it appears that citizenship grants were displayed in the temple. Other temples or cult sites are attested epigraphically: I.Ephesos 101 (C5 ) mentions a hieron of Zeus Patroios and a hieron of Apollo Patroios, as does I.Ephesos 102 ( c. 300 ). The hieron of Zeus Patroios is also attested in I.Ephesos 104 (C5 ). I.Ephesos 107 is a C4 private dedication to Μητηgraveρ ' Ορείη . The preserved theatre ( TGR iii. 494 -96 ) dates from the Heltic period, but an inscription of C4l ( I.Ephesos 1440 . 10 ) stipulates that the honours bestowed on Sostratos are to be proclaimed in the theatre at the festival of Dionysos. According to Xen. Hell . 3 . 4 . 18 and Ages . 1 . 25 , Ephesos had several gymnasia in C4 . That Ephesos was fortified in C6f is apparent from Herodotos' account of a siege by Kroisos ( 1 . 26 . 2 ; cf. 1 . 141 . 4 ). So far, a C6f city wall has not been confirmed archaeologically, but a stretch of polygonal wall on the north slope of the Panayırda˘ g hill is dated by ceramic evidence to c. 500 and is probably part of a city wall (Scherrer ( 2001 ) 60 figs. 3 no. 4 and 3 no. 9 ). Of Ephesian festivals, the Thesmophoria are mentioned in Hdt. 6 . 16 . 2 , and the Dionysia in I.Ephesos 1440 . 10 (C4l). For the Artemisia and the Ephesia and the question as to whether these two names refer to one festival or two, see Hornblower ( 1991 ) 527 -29 with references to the general discussion. A communal dedication by the Ephesians to Athena is recorded in IG ii² 1486 . 5 -6 (C4l). For the Ephesian calendar,see Trümpy, Monat . 96 -99 § 84 . At least six months were identical with the Athenian months. Ephesian citizens are attested as victors in the Olympic Games ( Olympionikai 398 ( 380 ), 431 ( 356 ) and 438 ( 352 )), in the Isthmian Games ( I.Ephesos 1416 . 20 (C4l)) and in the Nemean Games ( I.Ephesos 1415 . 6 , 1416 . 20 -21 ( c. 300 )). Ephesos struck coins from C7l. (I) Electrum C7l-C6 : denominations: stater and fractions down to forty-eighth.

845,Erythrai (Erythraios),Ionia,38.25,26.3,3032,14809,"845 . Erythrai (Erythraios) Map 56 . Lat. 38 . 25 , long. 26 . 30 . Size of territory: 5 , including several dependent poleis , for which see infra . Type: A. The toponym is ' Ερυθραί , αιasper (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 4 ; SEG 23 189 .II. 3 ( c. 330 )). The city-ethnic is ' Ερυθραῖος (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 4 ; IG i³ 14 . 4 (C5 )). According to Steph. Byz. 280 . 8 -9 , an alternative toponym was Κνωπουacuteπολις , for which his authority may have been Hecat. fr. 228 . In C5 the urban centre of Erythrai is called a polis by Hdt. 1 . 142 . 4 and in C4 in SEG 26 1282 . 5 -6 . Polis in the political sense is used about Erythrai in Hdt. 1 . 141 . 4 , 142 . 4 , 143 . 3 ; I.Erythrai 8 . 4 -6 = Tod 155 ( c. 357 -355 ); I.Erythrai 9 . 23 = Tod 165 (C4s); SEG 31 969 . 8 ( 351 -344 ). The polis cognate polites is used in SEG 31 969 . 15 -16 ( 351 -344 ) and SEG 36 1039 . 12 ( c. 400 ). Politeia is applied to the Constitution of Erythrai in Arist. Pol . 1305 b 20 -22 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in SEG 36 1039 . 5 ( c. 400 ); I.Erythrai 6 . 3 ( 394 ); and externally in Hipponax fr. 12 , West (C6 -C5 ); Hdt. 1 . 18 . 3 ; Dem. 8 . 24 ; IG i³ 14 . 4 , 8 , 22 ; and SEG 26 1282 . 11 ( c. 387 ). For the individual and external use, see PEP Phokaia 20 (undated). The name of the territory is ' Ερυθραία , ηasper (Thuc. 3 . 29 . 2 , 8 . 24 . 2 , 33 . 2 ). Its size is likely to have varied considerably over time. In the Athenian tribute lists five communities are entered as part of the Erythraian synteleia , some or all of which may have been fully integrated into the Erythraian polis in C4 when our sources for them dry up. But it is highly likely that they had been dependent poleis in their own right in the Archaic period and C5e; see infra . The settlement pattern on the Mimas peninsula is very complex, and the communities mentioned in the tribute quota lists have not even been securely located. In C5Erythraia comprised Κώρυκος , probably a settlement as well as a mountain (Thuc. 8 . 33 . 2 ) and the harbour /acuteΕ µ βατον (Thuc. 3 . 29 . 2 ). The borders of Erythrai with the poleis on the isthmus and perhaps with Chios (no. 840 )-whose peraia may have included territory on the Mimas peninsula-cannot be established for the Archaic and Classical periods. The most important evidence concerning the territory of Erythrai in C4 is I.Erythrai 151 ( c. 340 ), which contains a list of roads linking a number of locations in the territory of the city. The following toponyms-all unlocated-are listed in the text: Μαλυείη (l. 1 ), Κλέαι (l. 2 ), Κεγκρευacuteς (ll. 7 , 11 ), Πρινευacuteς (l. 20 ), Κολώνη (l. 21 ), Ευ µ αιdieresisacuteς (l. 22 ), Μαραθουgraveς επιgrave θάλασ [ σαν ] (l. 26 ), Οίη (l. 27 ), οasper Χαλκιδέων Λι µ ήν (l. 40 ). SEG 37 917 (C5l/C4e) concerns sale of land and mentions other locations, presumably within Erythraian territory. The locations mentioned are εν Αργαδευtildeσιν (A 7 ), εν Αυλικοῖς (A 9 , 12 ), εν Αacuteγροις (A 16 ). According to Hellan. fr. 48 , Erythrai was one of the poleis founded by Neleus, son of Kodros. Erythrai belonged to the Ionian dodekapolis (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 4 ) and contributed eight ships for the battle of Lade (Hdt. 6 . 8 . 2 ). In 391 -388 Erythrai sent representatives who participated as judges in the arbitration between Miletos (no. 854 ) and Myous (no. 856 ) (Tod 113 . 15 ). In C5Erythrai was a member of the Delian League, from which it defected, perhaps in the 450 s, but see Gehrke, Stasis 66 n. 4 . Athens managed to win back Erythrai shortly afterwards (the conventional date is 452 : the most important evidence for Athens' imposing her will is IG i³ 14 = ML 40 and IG i³ 15 , both mentioning a garrison and Athenian episkopoi ). Erythrai belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded as a paying member from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 13 , v . 13 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 29 ) a total of sixteen times, paying a phoros of often 7 tal. ( IG i³ 268 . ii . 27 ) but sometimes higher amounts, e.g. 9 tal. ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 28 ) or 12 tal. ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 28 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 126 ). In 412 Erythrai joined forces with the Peloponnesians (Thuc. 8 . 14 . 2 ), and Erythraian infantry assisted the Lakedaimonians (Thuc. 8 . 16 . 1 ). Five communities are recorded in the Athenian tribute lists together with Erythrai as Erythraian dependencies: viz . the Βουθειεῖς , the ' Ελαιόσιοι , the Πολιχναῖοι (-ῖται ), the Πτελεόσιοι and the Σιδόσιοι . With one possible exception ( IG i³ 274 . iii . 11 , completely restored), the Erythraioi are recorded as the first of the six communities, and the presumption is that the five others were dependencies dominated by Erythrai. In the years 450 / 49 to 447 / 6 the six communities formed a synteleia ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 13 -18 , 264 . iii . 28 -30 , 265 . i . 58 -64 , 268 . i . 27 -28 , 268 . ii . 27 ); from 443 / 2 to 438 / 7 they paid individually ( 269 . i . 20 -25 , 270 . i . 22 -27 , 271 . i . 18 -20 , 272 . ii . 16 -21 , 273 . i . 32 -ii . 6 , 274 . iii . 6 -11 ). In 433 / 2 the tribute was paid by the ' Ερυ [ θραῖοι ] καιgrave Χ [ συντελ ˜ ες ] ( IG i³ 279 . i . 48 -49 ); and in 430 / 29 the five small communities are recorded after Erythrai but as communities belonging to Erythrai: ' Ερυθραῖοι , Βουθει ˜ ες ' Ερυθραίον , etc. ( IG i³ 281 A. 19 -24 ), but later in the same inscription ( 61 -66 ) they are recorded with their own ethnic without any mention of their dependent status.In later tribute lists and in the assess- ment decree of 425 / 4 we meet the Βουθει ˜ ες ( IG i³ 282 . iv . 38 , 283 . iii . 29 , 284 . ii . 1 ), the ' Ελαιόσιοι ( IG i³ 284 . ii . 2 -3 , 71 . ii . 151 ), the Πολιχναῖοι ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 30 , 71 . i . 145 ) and the Πτελεόσιοι ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 93 ), sometimes recorded as belonging to Erythrai; yet-and no doubt accidentally-there is no further reference to the Σιδόσιοι . Syntelies were usually formed by grouping poleis together and not by severing civic subdivisions from a polis to which they formerly belonged (Schuller ( 1974 ) 58 -60 ). Thus, the presumption is that the five small communities listed after the Erythraioi in the tribute lists were small poleis dependent on Erythrai (see the individual entries). After the battle of Knidos in 394 , Erythrai entered into an alliance with Athens (Diod. 14 . 83 . 3 ). Diplomatic relations, perhaps in the form of a treaty, are attested in IG ii² 108 ( 366 / 5 ). I.Erythrai 9 = Tod 165 (after 350 ) concerns an alliance with promise of mutual military assistance between Erythrai and the tyrant Hermias at Atarneus (ll. 15 -30 ). The earliest attested constitution seems to have been a narrow oligarchy controlled by the Basilidai (Arist. Pol . 1305 b 18 -22 ), followed by a moderate democracy or a moderate oligarchy in which eligibility for being a dikastes was restricted by a census of thirty staters. Cases are initiated by a volunteer prosecutor ( ho boulomenos ), introduced by the prytaneis , and heard by a dikasterion composed of nine men from each phyle ( I.Erythrai 2 A): i.e. twenty-seven dikastai altogether if there were three phylai ( infra ). No explicit qualifications are prescribed for active participation as a prosecutor in public actions. The decree may have permitted even those who were not full citizens but children of freedmen or foreigners to act as prosecutors (B. 14 -24 as interpreted by Engelmann and Merkelbach ( 1972 ) 28 -29 ), and certain magistrates were presumably selected by lot ( 2 B. 25 -32 ; Engelmann and Merkelbach ( 1972 ) 29 ). In, probably, 453 / 2 a democratic constitution was enforced by Athens by a decree ( IG i³ 14 ) which stipulates that the 120 members of the boule are to be selected by lot (ll. 8 -9 ). Immediately before the Athenians passed their regulations for Erythrai, in response to the defection of that city from the Delian League, the city must have been ruled by a pro-Persian, oligarchic faction, perhaps for as limited a period as that which separates the two inscriptions I.Erythrai 2 and IG i³ 14 . This may be inferred from the Athenian regulations for Erythrai ( IG i³ 14 ), in which the previous regime in Erythrai is referred to as tyrannoi (l. 33 ). It is not known to what extent the regulations of IG i³ 14 were implemented. In the beginning of C4 there was a democracy in place in Erythrai (Tod 106 = I.Erythrai 6 ); but an Athenian decree of c. 387 testifies to a stasis , probably between oligarchs who control the city and democrats in control of the territory. The decree anticipates the democrats' conquest of the town ( SEG 26 1282 ; see Gehrke, Stasis 68 ). An oligarchic constitution can be assumed for C4l: no assembly is attested in a C4mcitizenship decree ( I.Erythrai 8 = Tod 155 ), and a decree is passed by the boule on the proposal of strategoi , prytaneis and epimenioi ( SEG 31 969 ( 351 -344 )). An undated decree ( I.Erythrai 10 ) providing for amnesty between Erythraians in the city and exiles (presumably democrats) is normally placed in the context of the reintroduction of democracy by Alexander the Great (Gehrke, Stasis 69 ). The eponymous official in C5Erythrai was the ιasperεροποιός ( I.Erythrai 1 . 16 -17 ; IG i³ 14 . 5 ; SEG 36 1039 . 29 ( c. 400 )). The assembly is attested in SEG 36 1039 . 7 ( c. 400 ); I.Erythrai 6 . 2 = Tod 106 ( 394 ) and I.Erythrai 21 . 1 ( 334 -332 ). IG i³ 14 . 13 -14 suggests that the Erythraians already had a boule when the Athenian decree was passed; cf. I.Erythrai 2 A 20 . For the boule in C4 , see SEG 36 1039 . 6 ( c. 400 ); I.Erythrai 6 . 1 ( 394 ); Tod 155 = I.Erythrai 8 . 1 ( 350 s); I.Erythrai 21 . 1 , 10 ( 334 -332 ). Among other officials we find the γρα µµ ατευacuteς ( I.Erythrai 1 . 2 , 3 -5 , 9 , 19 (C5 -C4 )); a board of εξετασταί ( I.Erythrai 1 . 14 (C5 -C4 ); I.Erythrai 21 . 2 -3 ( 334 -332 )); a τα µ ίας ( I.Erythrai 1 . 7 (C5 -C4 )); πρυτάνεις ( I.Erythrai 2 . 29 (C5 )); επι µ ήνιοι ( SEG 31 969 . 3 ); στρατηγοί ( I.Erythrai 9 . 19 -21 , 21 . 2 ( 334 -332 )); an αγωνοθέτης ( I.Erythrai 21 . 16 ( 334 -332 )); and a ιasperεροκηtildeρυξ ( SEG 36 1039 . 9 -10 ( c. 400 )). The epigraphic evidence includes several C5 -C4lists recording sales of real estate ( I.Erythrai 153 -54 ; SEG 37 917 -19 ). It is uncertain whether the decree on trade, I.Erythrai 15 (C4 ), was passed by Chios (no. 840 ) or by Erythrai. Erythrai granted proxenia and citizenship to Konon of Athens and his descendants in 394 ( I.Erythrai 6 . 10 -13 = Tod 106 ) and to Maussolos of Mylasa (no. 913 ) and his descendants in the 350 s ( I.Erythrai 8 . 6 ). In C4 proxenia was received from Kolophon (no. 848 ) ( AJP 56 ( 1935 ) 358 -79 iv . 6 ). Erythraian theorodokoi to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) are attested in SEG 23 189 . ii . 3 ( 330 -324 ). The civic subdivisions of Erythrai were phylai ( I.Erythrai 2 . 14 (C5 ), 14 . 2 (C4 )), gene ( SEG 31 969 . 16 ) and presumably also chiliastyes ( I.Erythrai 17 from C5 is interpreted as a decree concerning the local affairs of the chiliastys of the Pepronioi; the earliest designation of this local group as a chiliastys is I.Erythrai 81 . 14 (C1 )). There may have been three phylai (Jones, POAG 304 ). For free non-citizens, see I.Erythrai 2 B. 23 -24 (C5 ), with a distinction between emancipated slaves and 'foreigners' and SEG 36 1039 . 12 ( c. 400 ). Athena Polias is mentioned in I.Erythrai 208 . 8 -9 (C4e) and 210 . 1 (C5 -C4e).Other communal cults are those of Zeus Agoraios ( I.Erythrai 2 B. 8 -10 ), and Apollo and Asklepios) ( I.Erythrai 205 ( 380 -360 )). In I.Erythrai 21 . 14 ( 334 -332 ) the Dionysia are mentioned as an occasion where public honours are to be proclaimed. A festival for Apollo and Asklepios is mentioned in I.Erythrai 205 . 28 ( 380 -360 ). SEG 36 1039 . 3 -4 ( c. 400 ) contains evidence for theopropoi . IG i³ 14 . 3 -5 suggests a significant Erythraian presence at the festival of the Panathenaia. Some of Erythrai's public architecture is attested epigraphically: the prytaneion ( I.Erythrai 21 . 17 ( 334 -332 )), the agora ( I.Erythrai 8 . 12 -13 , 10 . 16 (C4 ), 151 . 2 , 3 , 6 , 8 , 14 ( c. 340 )) and a stoa ( I.Erythrai 10 . 12 -13 ). The earliest phase of the monumental temple of Athena dates back to C8 , with rebuilding work in C6 and destruction in c. 545 . The temple was rebuilt soon after, in the 530 s (Mitchell ( 1985 ) 83 ). It is attested epigraphically ( I.Erythrai 8 . 14 ( 350 s), 21 . 20 ( 334 -332 )), as are the Herakleion ( I.Erythrai 21 . 20 -21 ) and a number of other cult sites mentioned in I.Erythrai 151 ( c. 340 ), including sanctuaries of Athena ( 12 ), Apollo ( 25 ), Artemis ( 34 ) and Achilles ( 36 ). SEG 36 1039 ( c. 400 ) concerns the construction of a new temple for Aphrodite Pandemos. A theatre is attested from C4l ( TGR iii. 451 ), which was apparently still under construction in C3 ( I.Erythrai 24 . 32 ( 277 -275 )). As for the involvement of the Erythraian government in matters relating to infrastructure, see I.Erythrai 151 ( c. 340 ): water reservoirs, [ υasper ] δρο [ δόχεια ], may be referred to in l. 1 , and an extensive network of public roads through Erythraian territory is attested in this inscription. There are two categories of road: οasperδοgraveς δη µ οσίη and οasperδοgraveς ανδροβασ µ ός (Engelmann and Merkelbach ( 1972 ) 247 ). The acropolis is mentioned in IG i³ 15 . 44 ( c. 450 ); and I.Erythrai 21 (C4 ) mentions demolition of the acropolis, to which the honorand Phanes Mnesitheou has contributed. In 1966 there were excavations of Tempelschutt on the acropolis dating from c. 670 -545 (Mellink ( 1967 ) 169 ). The city walls of Erythrai enclose an area of 135 ha and are dated to C4l, and I.Erythrai 22 relates to their construction (Migeotte ( 1992 ) 211 -13 no. 68 ; McNicoll ( 1986 ) 310 with fig. 156 ); cf. Diod. 19 . 60 . 4 for a siege of the city in 315 . Erythrai struck silver and bronze coins in C6 -C4 . ( 1 ) Silver on the Milesian standard, before 480 : denominations: didrachm, trihemidrachm, tetrobol, diobol. Types: obv . naked horseman; rev . incuse square containing rosette. ( 2 ) Silver, c. 480 -400 : denominations: drachm, trihemiobol, obol, tetartemorion: obv . naked man holding horse, or Pegasos,or bull's head; rev . incuse square containing rosette; legend: ΕΡΥΘ . ( 3 ) Bronze, C5 : obv . head of Herakles in lion's skin; rev . various types; legend: ΕΡΥ . ( 4 ) Silver and bronze,C4 : denominations:tetradrachm,drachm,fractions in bronze: obv . head of Herakles in lion's skin; rev . various types; legend: ΕΡΥ and magistrate's name.(Babelon, Traité ii. 1 . 302 -6 , ii. 2 . 1135 -42 ; BMC Ionia pp. 116 -27 ; SNG Cop. Ionia 554 -617 ). According to Babelon, Erythrai stopped minting coins, as did Chios (no. 840 ), in 356 and resumed only in the Heltic period."
846,Isinda (Isindios),Ionia,,,186,852,"846 . Isinda (Isindios) Map 61 . Unlocated. Not in Barr . Type: C. The toponym, known only from Steph. Byz. 338 . 14 -16 , is /acuteΙσινδος or /acuteΙσινδα . However, the name of the site /acuteΙονδα close to Ephesos captured by Thibron in 391 / 90 as reported by Diod. 14 . 99 . 1 may be due to corruption of the text and may in fact have read /acuteΙσινδα originally ( ATL i. 493 ; cf. French ( 1994 ) 85 -86 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ισίνδιος , the collective use of which is attested externally in the Athenian tribute quota lists ( IG i³ 269 . i . 30 ). Isinda was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 445 / 4 ( IG i³ 267 . v . 16 , almost completely restored) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 44 ) a total of nine times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 280 . i . 44 )."
847,Klazomenai (Klazomenios),Ionia,38.2,26.45,1849,9000,"847 . Klazomenai (Klazomenios) Map 56 . Lat. 38 . 20 , long. 26 . 45 . Size of territory: ? Type: A. The toponym is Κλαζο µ εναί , αιasper (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 ; IG xii . 5 444 no. 27 (C3 )). The city-ethnic is Κλαζο µ ένιος ( SEG 28 697 . 8 = Ager ( 1996 ) no. 15 (C4l); IG ii² 9038 (C4 )). In C5 Klazomenai is called a polis in the urban sense in Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 and Thuc. 8 . 23 . 6 , and in the political sense in Hdt. 1 . 141 . 4 , 142 . 3 , 143 . 3 . In C4 it is called a polis in the urban sense in Aen. Tact. 28 . 5 , and in the political sense in Tod 113 . 21 and 38 ( 391 -388 ) and SEG 28 696 . 3 (C4l). The polis cognate polites is used in Aen. Tact. 28 . 5 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C4 coins ( infra ) and externally in Hipponax fr. 1 , West (C6 -C5 ); Hdt. 1 . 51 . 2 ; IG i³ 261 . i . 11 , 262 . ii . 17 , etc.; Thuc. 8 . 14 . 3 ; Tod 114 = I.Erythrai 502 . 4 ( 387 ). For the individual and external use, see Pl. Ap . 26 D: Αναξαγόρον τουtilde Κλαζο µ ενίου ; Isoc. 4 . 235 (rC5 ); I.Erythrai 16 . 10 (C4l); IG ii² 9038 (C4 ). The name of the territory was Κλαζο µ ενία in SEG 28 697 . 10 = Ager ( 1996 ) no. 15 ; this inscription is an arbitration concerning the territory of Klazomenai and its neigh- bour(s) carried out by judges from Kos (no. 497 ) towards the end of C4 . It has been suggested by Ager ( 1991 ) that Teos (no. 868 ) is one of the cities which was involved in the dispute. She suggests that, in the inscription, the entire territories of Teos and Klazomenai are defined, starting from the border of Kolophonia (l. 11 ) in the east and moving westwards on to the isthmus of the Mimas peninsula. It may be inferred from Ephor. fr. 25 that a location called Λά µ ψος was part of Klazomenian territory; and another settlement, Σκυφία , is mentioned in Ephor. fr. 26 = Steph. Byz. 580 . 5 -6 . Steph. Byz. calls Skyphia a πολίχνιον Κλαζο µ ενίων , but it is uncertain whether this site-classification stems from Ephoros. In Thuc. 8 . 14 . 3 and 8 . 23 . 6 we are informed that the Klazomenians fortified Πολίχνα on the mainland. We do not know if this Polichna was identical with the Erythraian dependency known as Polichne (see infra and Gomme et al . ( 1981 ) 35 ). At 8 . 23 . 6 Thucydides reports that those Klazomenians who had been responsible for the rebellion against Athens retired to ∆αφνουacuteς after the Athenian conquest of Polichna (see also Thuc. 8 . 31 . 2 ; IG i³ 119 . 5 ( 407 ), and infra ). From Thuc. 8 . 31 . 3 -4 it appears that the Klazomenians also controlled three neighbouring islands: Drymoussa, Pele and Marathoussa. These islands were used for safe keeping of property. According to Paus. 7 . 3 . 9 , the Klazomenians moved their urban centre from the mainland to the adjacent island because of their vulnerability to attacks in the Archaic period (see also Strabo 14 . 1 . 36 ). This is now confirmed by the finds at the site of Chyton (no. 841 ), identified as the Archaic urban centre of Klazomenai,which show that the settlement was abandoned in C6m. Klazomenai belonged to the Ionian dodekapolis (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 ), and Klazomenian representatives acted as judges in the arbitration between Myous (no. 856 ) and Miletos (no. 854 ) in 391 -388 (Tod 113 . 21 -25 ). Klazomenai was a member of the Delian League.It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 21 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 39 ) a total of eighteen times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of first 1½ tal. ( IG i³ 261 . i . 11 ), raised to 5 tal., 2 , 000 dr. in 427 / 6 or 426 / 5 ( IG i³ 284 . 6 ) and to 15 tal. in 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 39 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 147 ) and possibly also in 410 / 9 ( IG i³ 100 . 7 : [ Κλαζο µ ] ένι [ οι ]). Klazomenai defected from the League in 412 and moved the urban centre from the island to Polichna on the mainland (Thuc. 8 . 14 . 3 ); but it was won back by Athens later in the same year. The bulk of the population was moved back to the island, while the anti-Athenian faction fled to Daphnous (Thuc. 8 . 23 . 6 ). A Spartan attempt to conquer the island failed (Thuc. 8 . 31 . 2 -3 ), and the Klazomenians were still allied to Athens in 410 (Xen. Hell . 1 . 1 . 10 -11 ). A protracted stasis between the pro-Spartan and probably oligarchic faction in Daphnous and the proAthenian and probably democratic faction in the urban centre on the island (Thuc. 8 . 31 . 2 -3 ) was provisionally ended in 407 by a treaty between the Athenians and the faction in Daphnous ( IG i³ 119 . 5 = I.Erythrai 501 ), but the stasis continued (Diod. 13 . 79 . 1 ); see Gehrke, Stasis 78 . In 387 / 6 there seems to have been a democratic government in place in Klazomenai, and a treaty with Athens was concluded in 387 / 6 (Tod 114 = I.Erythrai 502 ) with Klazomenai as a subordinate party. But it is also clear that a stasis of some kind had preceded this decree. Stasis appears to have been endemic at Klazomenai in C4 (Arist. Pol . 1303 b 9 and, perhaps, Aen. Tact. 28 . 5 -6 ). In the King's Peace of 386 Klazomenai is explicitly mentioned as an island belonging to Persia (Xen. Hell . 5 . 1 . 31 ), but, pace Gehrke, Stasis 79 , there is no compelling evidence that a tyranny or a narrow oligarchy was set up by Python when he conquered Klazomenai in C4m (Aen. Tact. 28 . 5 -6 ). The only unquestionably attested public enactment is a psephisma of C4l: SEG 28 696 . 6 , moved by a board of timouchoi (l. 1 ) and implying that the Klazomenians levied taxes on imports and exports (l. 5 ). Hierokleides of Klazomenai received proxenia from Athens (no. 361 ) in 424 / 3 ( IG i³ 227 ). Klazomenian theorodokoi to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) are attested in SEG 23 189 . ii . 1 ( 330 -324 ). A cult of Athena Polias may be attested for Klazomenai: Oikonomos ( 1921 ) 74 reported on an inscription which he found in a sanctuary on the island. He did not give a transcript of the text, but his description suggests that the goddess worshipped on the small acropolis on the island may have been Athena Polias. There was a Klazomenian treasury in Delphi (Hdt. 1 . 51 . 2 ). According to Diod. 15 . 18 . 2 , Kyme (no. 817 ) and Klazomenai consulted the oracle at Delphi in 383 , shortly after the death of Tachos, in connection with their dispute over Leukai (no. 819 ), which contained an Apollo sanctuary. An Olympian victor, Herodotos of Klazomenai, is attested in Paus. 6 . 17 . 2 (C4 according to RE s.v. Herodotos 1 , but not in Olympionikai ). For a Klazomenian victor in the Pythia, see SEG 18 214 (C4 -C3 ). SEG 18 214 is a communal dedication by the Klazomenians at Delphi (C4 -C3 ). Like other Ionian cities, Klazomenai may have been walled in the Archaic period (Hdt. 1 . 162 . 2 ). On the mainland site that housed the urban centre of Archaic Klazomenai there are C6 walls around the acropolis (Mellink ( 1983 ) 440 ). The island settlement was unfortified in 411 (Thuc. 8 . 31 . 3 ). Aen. Tact. 28 . 5 -6 describes a stratagem by which Python of Klazomenai gained control over the city by making wagons stop in the gates, thereby allowing his forces to enter. The episode may belong in C4 after the King's Peace (Gehrke, Stasis 79 ; Whitehead ( 1990 ) 179 ). Cook ( 1953 -54 ) 151 described the walls of the island settlement as of massive square masonry with backing containing plenty of black glazed pottery of the early and middle C4 . Both the mainland site and the island settlement have been under excavation during the 1980 s and 1990 s, but so far most finds await publication. Klazomenai minted coins of electrum, silver and bronze from C6 to C4 . A silver drachm was found in the Asyut coin hoard, dating from 499 -494 (Price and Waggoner ( 1975 ) 85 ). ( 1 ) Electrum and silver on the Phoenician standard, C6 -C5 : denominations: didrachm, drachm, diobol. Types: obv . forepart of winged boar; rev . quadripartite incuse square.

For the controversy surrounding the coin hoard of electrum staters at Klazomenai in a sealed jar in a 580 s context, see Le Rider ( 1994 )). The Klazomenians were the original colonisers of Abdera (no. 640 ), according to Hdt. 1 . 168 ; they were also co-colonisers of Naukratis (no. 1023 ) in the reign of Amasis (Hdt. 2 . 178 )."

The polis cognate polites is used in PEP Kolophon 1 . 5 , 6 . 28 ( 311 -306 ). A Κολοφωνίων πολιτεία was included among the 158 Aristotelian constitutions (fr. 520 . 1 -2 ). The verb πολιτευacuteειν is found in Thuc. 3 . 34 . 2 . Hdt. 1 . 14 . 4 applies the word asty to the urban centre of Kolophon. The word patris is used of Kolophon in Hdt. 1 . 150 . 1 and SEG 35 1125 . 3 ( c. 300 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in PEP Kolophon 6 . 9 ( 311 -306 ) and on C5 coins ( infra ) and externally in Hdt 1 . 147 . 2 ; Thuc. 3 . 34 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 3 ; PEP Kolophon 16 (a C4 inscription found in Byzantion, perhaps commemorating a public slave of Kolophon). The individual and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in ML 7 f ( 591 ); Pind. fr. 188 , Bergk; IG i³ 65 . 9 ( 427 / 6 ) and 1347 (C5 tombstone set up at Athens). The name of the territory is Κολοφωνία ( SEG 28 697 . 10 = Iscr.Cos ED 174 ). This text may relate to an arbitration between Teos (no. 868 ) and Klazomenai (Ager ( 1991 )); and if Ager's interpretation is accepted, this inscription shows that Kolophonian territory bordered on the territories of Teos and Klazomenai (no. 847 ) in the west (see also Ager ( 1996 ) 67 -69 no. 15 ). The northern and eastern boundaries of Kolophonian territory in the Archaic and Classical periods are unknown. In PEP Kolophon 6 (C4 ) the territory ( chora ) and urban centre ( polis ) are mentioned. The territory of Kolophon contained Klaros with its Apollo sanctuary and the harbour town Notion (Thuc. 3 . 34 . 1 : Νότιον τοgrave Κολοφωνίων ); see Notion (no. 858 ). The history of Kolophon begins c. 700 with a stasis between two factions. One of the factions emigrated to Smyrna, then an Aiolian city, but subsequently the Kolophonians expelled the Smyrnaians and had Smyrna turned into an Ionian city (Hdt. 1 . 16 . 2 , 150 . 1 -2 ; see Smyrna (no. 867 )). C. 660 Kolophon was conquered by Gyges of Lydia (Hdt. 1 . 14 . 4 ).According to Arist.fr. 601 and Timaios ( FGrHist 556 ) fr. 56 , Siris (no. 69 ) in southern Italy was founded by colonists from Kolophon, and a combination of the sources has led to the view that these colonists left Kolophon because of Gyges' conquest (Demand ( 1990 ) 31 -33 ; supra 293 ). Theognidea 1103 , West,suggests that Kolophon was destroyed in a way similar to Smyrna (no. 867 ) and Magnesia (no. 852 ). It is uncertain whether the destruction of Kolophon was connected with Gyges' conquest or should rather be connected, e.g., with the story that Alyattes of Lydia had all the Kolophonian knights killed (Polyaen. 7 . 2 . 2 ). Kolophon belonged to the Ionian dodekapolis (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 ) and must have been under Persian rule from the 540 s. In C5 Kolophon was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 21 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 40 ) a total of sixteen times, four times completely restored, paying a phoros of first 3 tal. ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 21 ), reduced to 1½ tal. in 446 / 5 ( IG i³ 266 . i . 10 ), raised to 3 tal. in 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . i . 38 ) and reduced to 500 dr. in 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 24 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 135 ). In 430 Kolophon was conquered by the Persians in consequence of a stasis between the citizens. The Kolophonians living in the city fled and settled in Notion (no. 858 ). The stasis flared up again, and the city of Notion was divided into two sections separated by a wall.One part,described as a teichos , was inhabited by Medising Kolophonians and Notieis who now united and formed a political community. The other part of the city was inhabited by the opposite faction of Kolophonian immigrants (and, undoubtedly, some Notieis). In 427 they invited an Athenian squadron under Paches. The Athenians conquered the teichos , expelled the Medising Kolophonians, gave Notion to the other Kolophonians, and later sent a contingent of Athenian colonists supplemented with Kolophonians from all poleis (Thuc. 3 . 34 . 1 -4 ). This incident is reflected in the Athenian tribute lists, where the phoros paid by Kolophon is reduced from 3 tal. in 432 / 1 to 500 dr. paid in 428 / 7 and the following years down to 416 / 15 ( supra ). For corresponding variations in Notion's payments, see infra 1089 . An undated C5 treaty between Athens and Kolophon with Kolophon as a subordinate party ( IG i³ 37 , cf. 42 -43 ) must belong in this context too, since it regulates the relations between the Kolophonians and the Athenian colonists (ll. 20 , 23 , 42 ). In the following period Notion and Kolophon are both listed side by side as members of the Delian League, viz . in 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 23 -24 ), 421 / 0 ( IG i³ 285 . i . 40 -41 ) and 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 40 -41 ). Thus, both persisted as separate political communities, but inland Kolophon was still in Persian hands and was not reconquered by the Athenians until 409 (Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 4 ). It is unknown whether, from 427 to 409 , the communities of the Kolophonians and Notieis were both centred on Notion,or whether a New Kolophon-at-Sea was founded, a community that remained distinct from the community of the Notieis who occupied the harbour of Notion; see Piérart ( 1984 ) 168 -71 , pointing out that the Kolophon mentioned in IG i³ 37 . 9 is probably the New Kolophon,inhabited by the Kolophonians and the Athenian colonists. Following Mattingly ( 1966 ) 210 -12 = ( 1996 ) 174 -78 , 372 -74 , Piérart prefers a low dating of IG i³ 37 , 42 -43 , contra IG i³ pp. 40 -41 followed by Gehrke, Stasis 80 . According to Arist. Pol . 1290 b 14 -17 , Kolophon had been an oligarchy before their war against the Lydians; but the oligarchy was of a peculiar kind, in so far as those citizens who met the property qualifications outnumbered those who did not. It is normally assumed that Kolophon continued as an oligarchy well into C5m (Gehrke, Stasis 80 ). The 'New Kolophon' founded by Athenian colonists and Kolophonians in the 420 s was democratic ( IG i³ 37 . 47 -49 ; Thuc. 3 . 34 . 4 ). Very little is known about Kolophon's history in C4 . Gehrke, Stasis 81 -82 assumes that it had an oligarchic constitution, introduced after the King's Peace and replaced with a democracy by Alexander ( PEPKolophon 6 ( 311 -306 )). Civic subdivisions of Kolophon in the Archaic and Classical periods are unattested apart from gene , for which see Robert ( 1936 ) 163 -64 , who discusses the use of gene designations in PEP Kolophon 6 ( 311 -306 ). A νό µ ος Κολοφονίων is referred to in the heavily restored inscription IG i³ 37 . 43 ( 447 / 6 ). In C4 the eponymous official of Kolophon was the πρυacuteτανις ( PEP Kolophon 6 ). Evidence of the assembly is found in PEP Kolophon 1 (a C4l probouleumatic decree) and 6 , with mention of an εκκλησία κυρία (l. 32 ). The Kolophonian boule is attested in PEP Kolophon 1 and 6 . Officials connected with council and assembly are the επι µ ήνιοι ( PEP Kolophon 4 ( 311 -306 )) and the πρόεδροι ( PEP Kolophon 8 (C4 -C3 )); see Rhodes, DGS 357 . Other officials attested epigraphically are the καρπολόγος ( PEP Kolophon 6 ) and the board of πωληtildeται ( PEP Kolophon 4 ). For a Kolophonian embassy, see IG ii² 456 . 22 -28 ( 307 / 6 ). In C4l the Kolophonians bestowed proxenia and citizenship on two citizens of Erythrai (no. 845 ) ( AJP 56 ( 1935 ) 358 -79 iv . 5 -6 = PEP Kolophon 1 ). Kolophonian theoroi may be attested in IG i³ 43 . 14 and 22 ( 435 -427 ). Kolophon controlled ownership of land, as evidenced in the citizenship decree PEP Kolophon 5 ( 311 -306 ), mentioning γηtildeς έγκτησιν καιgrave οικίας . The same decree contains evidence for liturgies and eisphora , also levied on metics (ll. 12 -15 ). The verb µ ετοικεῖν is used in ll. 10 -11 . Other evidence for free non-citizens resident in Kolophon is provided by PEP Kolophon 6 ( 311 -306 ), in which responsibility is placed on ten commissioners for raising funds from foreigners, χρή µ ατα ξενικά . The list of individual contributors to the wall-building programme testifies to a large number of free foreigners residing at Kolophon, some registered with their city-ethnic ( Abderites , etc.) or other ethnic ( Makedon , etc.) (see also Robert ( 1936 ) 162 n. 2 ), some just called metoikoi ( 372 -73 , etc.), perhaps manumitted slaves who were perceived differently from those immigrants who insisted on keeping their original civic identity. The cult of Athena Polias is attested in PEP Kolophon 6 . Public festivals are attested in PEP Kolophon 1 (C4l), in which the honorands receive the privilege of προεδρίαν εν τοῖς αγῶσιν . For the Kolophonian calendar, see Trümpy, Monat . 99 -100 § 86 . Hermesianax of Kolophon was a victor in the Olympic Games in 320 ( SEG 35 1125 . 3 with Paus. 6 . 17 . 4 = Olympionikai no. 475 .). A Kolophonian victor in the Oropian Games is attested for C4 (probably between 366 and 338 ) in IG vii . 414 . 16 . IG ii² 456 b. 4 -8 records a dedication of a wreath to Athena by the demos of Kolophon ( 307 / 6 ). The remains of Kolophon excavated by Holland and published in 1944 are not easy to interpret; see Hoepfner and Osthues in Hoepfner et al . ( 1999 ) 280 -91 . C. 311 -306 the 'old' Kolophon was merged with a new and larger urban centre ( PEP Kolophon 6 ). It appears that, in connection with the joining together of the two urban centres, the buildings in the old centre were to be either privatised or demolished along with the old agora (l. 26 ). It may be inferred from the participle καταβάντας (l. 14 ) that the old city was located at a lower level than the C4settlement; but its precise location cannot be determined. Holland found evidence for C7structures close to a C4stoa and another structure, also C4 , which he interpreted as the Metroon. The Metroon is also attested epigraphically ( PEP Kolophon 5 ). Miller ( 1978 ) 109 -12 , 127 -28 classifies the building as a prytaneion annex. Hoepfner and Osthues (in Hoepfner et al . ( 1999 )) conclude that the Archaic city must have been located on the slope of the acropolis, pace e.g. Migeotte ( 1992 ) 217 , who follows Holland's ( 1944 ) suggestion that the old city was located in the plain to the north-east of the acropolis. In PEP Kolophon 6 temples in the old city are referred to generally, and in 16 -18 there is specific reference to altars for Zeus Soter, Poseidon Asphaleios, Apollo Klarios, Meter Antaie, Athena Polias and 'the other gods and heroes' . PEP Kolophon 6 concerns a great project of fortification which served in part to reunite the site of current habitation with the old (and apparently abandoned) urban centre of Kolophon (Migeotte ( 1992 ) 214 -23 no. 69 ). Some fortificatory structures were clearly already in existence ( 22 -23 ); but it is not clear if these fortifications enclosed the old or the new settlement; see de la Genière ( 1994 ). The circuit of 'New' Kolophon encloses an area of 80 + ha (Hoepfner et al . ( 1999 ) 284 ). Urbanisation may have taken place quite early at Kolophon: Hdt. 1 . 15 . 1 refers to Gyges' conquest of the asty of Kolophon in C7 . Remains of an early Archaic settlement (C7 ) have been found on the slope of the acropolis (Holland ( 1944 )). Kolophon struck coins of silver and bronze from C6l throughout C5 and C4 . The earliest silver types: ( 1 ) c. 525 -490 on the Persian standard: denominations: hemiobol, trihemitetartemorion, tetartemorion: obv . head of Apollo facing; rev . incuse square; legend: ΗΜ , ΤΡΙ , ΤΕ indicating denomination. ( 2 ) C5 on the Persian standard: denominations: drachm, trihemiobol, quarterobol: obv . Artemis laureate, or Apollo laureate; legend: ΚΟ or ΚΟΛΟΦΩΝΙΟΝ or ΚΟΛΟΦΩΝΙΩΝ ; rev . lyre within incuse square; legend sometimes on rev . Silver and bronze, c. 389 -330 on the Rhodian standard: denominations: tetradrachm, drachm, hemidrachm, diobol and fractions in bronze: obv . head of Apollo laureate; rev . lyre, or tripod; legend: ΚΟΛΟ or ΚΟΛΟΦΩ or ΚΟΛΟΦΩΝΙΟΝ and magistrate's name (Head, HN ² 569 -70 ; BMC Ionia 36 -40 ; SNG Cop. Ionia 133 -48 ). For the Kolophonian foundation of Siris (no. 69 ) in southern Italy, see supra 1078 ."
849,Korykos (Korykaios),Ionia,38.1,26.35,249,1194,"849 . Korykos (Korykaios) Map 56 . Lat. 38 . 10 , long. 26 . 35 . Size of territory: unknown but probably 1 or 2 . Type: C. The toponym Κώρυκος , οasper (Thuc. 8 . 14 . 1 , 33 . 2 , 34 ) designates primarily the mountain in the southern part of the territory of Erythrai (no. 845 ) (Thuc. 8 . 33 . 2 ; Hecat. fr. 231 ) but also a homonymous community, described by Ephor. fr. 27 as a polismation ( Barr . records the mountain but not the settlement). The city-ethnic is Κωρυκαῖος (Ephor. fr. 27 ; Strabo 14 . 1 . 32 ). Korykos was located in Erythraian territory (Thuc. 8 . 33 . 2 ), and it had another small community, Myonnesos (no. 855 ), as its neighbour (Ephor. fr. 27 ). On the coast along the foot of the mountain were a row of small harbours, which were all nests of pirates (Ephor. fr. 27 ; Strabo 14 . 1 . 32 ). Korykos seems to have been one of them. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested in an external context in Ephor. fr. 27 and in a proverb quoted by Strabo 14 . 1 . 32 . A controversy surrounds some Imperial coins which may or may not have been minted by this community (see Imhoof-Blumer ( 1902 ) 463 versus von Aulock ( 1968 ) versus Robert ( 1981 ) 352 n. 42 )."
850,Lebedos (Lebedios),Ionia,38.05,27.0,569,2606,"850 . Lebedos (Lebedios) Map 61 . Lat. 38 . 05 , long. 27 . 00 . Size of territory: probably 2 or 3 . Type: A. The toponym is Λέβεδος , ηasper (Thuc. 8 . 19 . 4 ; Strabo 14 . 1 . 29 ). The city-ethnic is Λεβέδιος (Michel 484 . 2 -3 (C4l)). Lebedos is attested as a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 ) and in the political sense (Hdt. 1 . 141 . 4 , 142 . 3 , 143 . 3 ; Tod 113 . 26 , 39 ( 391 -388 ); Syll . ³ 344 . 19 ( c. 303 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C2 coins (Head, HN ² 580 ) and externally in IG i³ 71 . i . 138 , 263 . ii . 6 , 266 . i . 13 ; T od 113 . 26 ( 391 -388 ); Syll . ³ 344 . 6 ( c. 303 ). Lebedos belonged to the Ionian dodekapolis (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 ), and its representatives participated in the C4 arbitration between Miletos (no. 854 ) and Myous (no. 856 ) (Tod 113 . 26 ). It is also clear from Michel 484 that in C4l the Lebedians were part of the Ionian association, presumably with representatives in the common Ionian boule . Lebedos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 451 / 50 ( IG i³ 262 . ii . 32 ) to 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . i . 42 , mostly restored) a total of eleven times, four times completely restored, paying a phoros of 3 tal. down to, probably, 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 33 ) and thereafter 1 tal. ( IG i³ 266 . i . 13 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 138 ). It revolted in 411 (Thuc. 8 . 19 . 4 ). The most important evidence for Lebedos is Syll . ³ 344 , which contains Antigonos I's instructions concerning the synoecism of Lebedos ( c. 303 ). The decree is difficult to use retrospectively, but it can be inferred from l. 21 that Lebedos had issued grants of proxenia . Theorodokoi of Lebedos to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) are attested in SEG 23 189 . ii . 6 ( 330 -324 ). Michel 484 . 1 -9 refers to a lawsuit concerning the priesthood of Zeus Boulaios and Hera, in which the Lebedians were involved. It is possibly an interpolis dispute over a common Ionian priesthood. In Antigonos I's instructions on the proposed synoecism of Teos and Lebedos, Syll . ³ 344 . 24 -26 ( c. 303 ), it is assumed that symbolaia exist between the two cities, and that each of them has its own laws. The eponymous office of πρυacuteτανις mentioned in Michel 484 . 1 and 10 may have pertained to Lebedos, as argued by Magnetto ( 1997 ) 63 , rather than to Priene (no. 861 ), as has normally been assumed. The walls of Lebedos were described by G. Weber ( 1904 ) 229 , who did not attempt to date the fortification. It is presumably Heltic."

This community, which, in Classical sources, is attested only in two passages in Xen. Hell ., is called a polis in the urban sense at 4 . 8 . 17 . It was located in the Maiandros valley, and contained a famous sanctuary of Artemis ( 3 . 2 . 19 ). It may have been situated at the site of the refounded Magnesia on the Maiandros (thus Barr .), but this cannot be determined with certainty."
852,Magnesia (Magnes),Ionia,,,1046,5421,"852 . Magnesia (Magnes) Map 61 . Location before 399 unknown,after 399 : lat. 37 . 50 , long. 27 . 30 . Size of territory: ? Type: A. The toponym is Μαγνησίη , ηasper (Hdt. 1 . 161 , 3 . 122 . 1 , 125 . 2 ) or Μαγνησία ηasper Ασιανή (Thuc. 1 . 138 . 5 , 8 . 50 . 3 ). The city-ethnic is Μάγνης ( IG xii . 6 35 . 3 (C4l); cf. Shipley ( 1987 ) 163 ), to which Hdt. 3 . 90 . 1 adds οasper εν τηsubiotaηtilde Ασίηsubiotaη . In C4Magnesia is called a polis both in the urban sense (Ps.-Skylax 98 : πόλις ' Ελληνίς ; cf. also Diod. 14 . 36 . 3 (r 400 )) and in the political sense ( SEG 14 459 . 7 (C4l/C3e)). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested both externally (Archil. fr. 20 , West; Theognidea 603 , 1103 , West) and internally on C4m coins ( infra ) and in inscriptions ( I.Magnesia 2 . 13 (C4l)). The individual and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in IG xii . 6 35 . 3 (C4l) and CEG ii 855 (C4l/C3e), which also uses patris about the community. In Hdt. 3 . 90 . 1 , the Magnesians of Asia are mentioned alongside the Ionians and Aiolians, and they seem to have been regarded as a group apart.According to SEG 14 459 . 7 -9 ( = CEG II 855 (C4l/C3e)), Magnesia was founded from Thessaly. Presumably in C7 , Magnesia waged war against Ephesos (no. 844 ) (Kallinos fr. 3 , West). A physical destruction of Magnesia by the Kimmerians in C7 is related by Strabo 14 . 1 . 39 -40 , who cites Archilochos (fr. 20 , West) as corroboration. He also claims that Miletos (no. 854 ) annexed the site, but it is not known for how long the Milesians were left in control. Hdt. 1 . 161 shows that the city had been rebuilt by 547 / 6 , when it was plundered by Mazares and subjected to Persia. The city remained under Persian control even after the establishment of the Delian League: the Persian king granted tax-levying rights at Magnesia to Themistokles during the latter's exile (Thuc. 1 . 138 . 5 ). When Astyochos approached Tissaphernes in connection with Alkibiades' intrigues in 411 , Tissaphernes was apparently based in Magnesia (Thuc. 8 . 50 . 3 ). The city was under the control of Tissaphernes in 400 when it was captured by Thibron. When Thibron failed to take Tralleis, he returned to Magnesia, and because the city was unfortified, he decided to relocate it to a mountain nearby called Thorax (Diod. 14 . 36 . 2 -4 ). Very little is known about the constitution of Magnesia. The Aristotelian collection of constitutions included a Magneton politeia (Heracl. Lemb. 50 ; Arist. no. 106 ), and at Pol . 1289 b 38 -40 Aristotle mentions the importance of the cavalry of Archaic Magnesia as an illustration of his claim that communities dependent on such forces tended to have an oligarchic constitution. But Magnesia was evidently a democracy in late C4 ( I.Magnesia 1 and 2 ). I.Magnesia 1 (C4 ) and 2 (C4l) are both public enactments passed by the Magnesian assembly ( 2 . 8 -9 : έδοξε τηtildeι βουληtildeι καιgrave τῶι δή µ ωι ). The eponymous official of Magnesia in C4l was the πρυacuteτανις ( 2 . 2 -3 ). The Magnesian boule is attested in I.Magnesia 2 . 8 (cited supra ) in a probouleutic capacity. A grammateus (of the boule ?) is attested in 2 . 7 . A Magnesian theorodokos to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) is attested in SEG 23 189 . ii . 11 ( 330 -324 ). The months Αγνηιών ( I.Magnesia 1 . 3 ) and Παλλειών ( I.Magnesia 2 . 3 ) are attested for C4 . Both are untypical of Ionian calendars (Trümpy, Monat . 110 -11 § 94 ). AMagnesian victor in the Olympic Games is attested in C5l ( Olympionikai 329 ), another in 344 ( Olympionikai 449 ), and one in the Pythian Games is attested in C4 -C3 ( SEG 14 459 ). The citizen body of Magnesia was subdivided into phylai in C4 ( I.Magnesia 2 . 4 ). The names of five phylai are attested in inscriptions of C3f ( I.Magnesia 2 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 11 ), and all five are named after the Olympian gods (Ares, Aphrodite, Hermes, Hestia and Zeus). Thus, Magnesia may already in the Classical period have had all twelve phylai named after the twelve Olympian gods (Jones, POAG 315 -17 ). Proxenia and probably also citizenship were given to the Makedonian Apollophanes ( I.Magnesia 2 (C4l)). A grant of enktesis is given in I.Magnesia 2 . 15 , and Magnesian tax-levying powers may be inferred from the grant of ateleia in I.Magnesia 2 . 15 -16 . Resident free non-citizens are attested in the C4funerary monuments I.Magnesia 258 ( Αχαιός ) and 259 ( Σα µ ίη ). The agora of C5Magnesia is attested in Thuc. 1 . 138 . 5 . The sanctuary of Artemis Leukophryene (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 19 ) presumably lay within the urban centre of the relocated Magnesia ( supra ). Foundations dating back to C6e have been discovered beneath the Heltic Artemision. The earliest attested coinage is a C5m silver didrachm on the Attic standard bearing the name Themistokles ( BMC Ionia 158 ). Types: obv . Apollo standing, holding olive branch; legend: ΘΕΜΙΣΤ [ ΟΚ ] ΛΕΟΣ ; rev . eagle with spread wings,border square of dots; legend: MA.From C4m Magnesia struck coins of silver and bronze.

853,Marathesion (Marathesios),Ionia,37.5,27.15,253,1211,"853 . Marathesion (Marathesios) Map 56 . Lat. 37 . 50 , long. 27 . 15 . Size of territory: probably 1 . Type: C. The toponym is Μαραθήσιον , τό (Ps.-Skylax 98 ). The city-ethnic is Μαραθήσιος ( IG i³ 270 . i . 6 ( 442 / 1 )). In the Archaic and Classical periods this community is attested only in the Athenian tribute lists and in Ps.-Skylax 98 , who unfortunately offers no site-classification. From I.Priene 37 . 57 -58 (C2 ) it appears that Samos (no. 864 ) claimed to have received Marathesion from Miletos (no. 854 ) after the Meliac War ( c. 700 ), and according to Strabo 14 . 1 . 20 Ephesos (no. 844 ) later received Marathesion from the Samians in return for Anaia (no. 838 ). The date of this transfer cannot be determined. Thus, Marathesion seems to have been a dependent polis first under Miletos, then under Samos, and finally under Ephesos. Marathesion was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 443 / 2 ( IG i³ 269 . i . 5 , completely restored) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 28 ) a total of seven times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of first 3 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 270 . i . 6 ), but 2 , 000 dr. from 433 / 2 on ( IG i³ 279 . i . 16 )."
854,Miletos (Milesios),Ionia,37.35,27.15,6804,34866,"854 . Miletos (Milesios) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 27 . 15 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A. The toponym is Μίλητος , ηasper (Hecat. fr. 240 ; Thuc. 8 . 27 . 6 ; Syll . ³ 273 . 8 (C4s)). The city-ethnic is Μιλήσιος (Hdt. 2 . 179 . 1 ; Syll . ³ 273 . 5 (C4s)). The earliest reference to Miletos as a polis is in Hymn. Hom. Ap . 180 ( Μίλητον έχεις έναλον πόλιν (C8 -C6 ?)), where polis is used in the urban sense.In C5Miletos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 6 . 20 ; Thuc. 8 . 25 . 4 ) and in the political sense (Hdt. 5 . 29 . 2 ; Milet . vi . 1 187 . 7 = ML 43 ). In C4 again, both the urban sense ( OGIS 213 . 10 ( c. 300 )) and the political sense (Xen. An . 1 . 1 . 6 ; Syll . ³ 1002 . 5 = LSAM 44 ( c. 400 )) are attested. Polisma is found at Hdt. 6 . 6 ; for the idiom used, see Hansen ( 1995 ) 61 n. 154 . The polis cognate politeia (citizenship) is used in SEG 38 1193 . 8 ( 330 -320 ), in which there may also be an attestation of the word polites (pl.) in l. 5 . The Aristotelian collection of constitutions may have included a Milesion politeia (Arist. no. 116 ), but the evidence adduced by Gigon is rather slim. The word asty is used about the urban centre of Miletos in Hdt. 5 . 29 . 2 and 5 . 92 . ζ . 2 ; and Hdt. 5 . 99 . 2 uses astos about the citizens. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in Milet . i . 3 135 . 5 = Syll . ³ 273 (C4 ) and externally in Demodokos fr. 1 . 1 , West (C6 ?); Hdt. 4 . 137 . 2 ; Xen. An . 1 . 1 . 11 ; IG i³ 21 . 67 ; and Tod 195 . 1 ( c. 330 ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Hdt. 4 . 137 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 30 ; IG i³ 1356 (C5 ); and SEG 35 942 (Chios (C4 )). The name of the territory is ηasper Μιλησίη (-α ) (Hdt. 1 . 17 . 2 ; Thuc. 8 . 26 . 3 ). It was large and diverse and may have been as much as 2 , 000 km ² (Burford ( 1993 ) 19 ; Lohmann ( 1995 ), ( 1997 ), ( 1999 ); cf. Mitchell ( 1999 ) 154 for a summary). There were four distinct parts: Milesia itself (the limestone peninsula on which the city was situated on the northern side); Mt.Grion (the upland area to the east of Milesia); the lower Maiandros valley (then on the opposite shore of the Gulf of Latmos, controlled by Miletos perhaps as far as Magnesia); and the Milesian islands (Leros, Patmos, Lade, Pharmakoussa and probably also Lepsia). The physical distinction between different parts of Milesian territory may be reflected in Hdt. 6 . 20 ( τηtildeς δεgrave Μιλησίων χώρης . . . ταgrave περιgrave τηgraveν πόλιν καιgrave τοgrave πεδίον , ταgrave δεgrave υasperπεράκρια ). The territory comprised a number of named locations: Assesos (Hdt. 1 . 19 . 1 ), Didyma/Branchidai (Hdt. 1 . 46 . 2 , 157 . 3 ) and the harbour Panormos (Hdt. 1 . 157 . 3 ). The city also controlled some areas in the Maiandros valley (Hdt. 1 . 18 . 1 ). As for Milesian state control of Didyma, see Hdt. 5 . 36 . 3 : the scholar Hekataios reportedly suggested fund raising for the revolt against the Persian king by appropriating the temple treasures donated by Kroisos. Discussing the Archaic period, Tuchelt ( 1988 ) 433 n. 55 distinguishes-somewhat anachronistically-between zones of Milesian influence, directly controlled areas, and communities that belonged to a Milesian 'federation'( Staatsverband ). Assesos (modern Mengerevtepe: Lohmann ( 1995 ) 311 ) is known from Herodotos' account of the destruction of the sanctuary of Athena Assessia by Alyattes ( 1 . 19 -21 ). The location of the sanctuary is epigraphically attested by a C6 dedication (Herrmann ( 1995 ) 288 -92 ; cf. Wachter ( 1998 )). Lohmann ( 1995 ) 313 -14 reports that sondages in the temple carried out by von Graeve in 1993 confirm the report of Hdt. 1 . 19 . 1 of the destruction of the temple in the twelfth year of Alyattes' reign ( 608 or 598 or 594 ), and a further sondage revealed layers pointing to a second destruction by the Persians in 494 . The sanctuary seems to have lost its significance after the second destruction. Assesos was surrounded by a C5s wall ( 2 m wide) with three towers and a gate protecting not only the settlement itself,but also the coastal part of the Milesian chora as a whole (Lohmann ( 1995 ) 314 -21 ). Teichioussa : the toponym is Τειχιόση ( I.Didyma 6 . 1 ) or Τειχιουtildeσσα (Thuc. 8 . 26 . 3 , 28 . 1 ; IG i³ 71 . i . 122 ). The only pos- itive indication pointing to Teichioussa as a proper (dependent?) polis is I.Didyma 6 . 1 , in which a Τειχιόσης αρχός is attested. However, he may have been a Milesian official who was in charge of the settlement. The polis status of Teichioussa in the Archaic period cannot be ascertained (see Gehrke ( 1980 ) 30 n. 78 , who leaves open the possibility that Teichioussa became fully integrated into Milesian territory only after the return of the democrats who had formed a splinter community there in C5 ). It is clear that if Teichioussa had ever been a polis in its own right in the Archaic period, it certainly was not a member of the Delian League in its own right: in 454 / 3 Teichioussa provided a temporary home to Milesian democrats loyal to Athens ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 21 -22 : [ Μι ] λέσιοι [ εκ Τ ] ειχιόσσε [ ς ]). In later years Leros and Teichioussa are recorded by toponym after the Milesioi, and the payment recorded for all three amounts to 10 tal. ( IG i³ 284 . 15 -17 ( 427 / 6 or 426 / 5 ), 285 . i . 88 -90 ( 421 / 0 ) and 489 . i . 36 -38 ( 416 / 15 )). In 411 Teichioussa was definitely part of Milesian territory (Thuc. 8 . 26 . 3 : Τειχιουtildeσσαν τηtildeς Μιλησίας ). Voigtländer ( 1986 ) 627 describes remains of fortifications and housing complexes dating from between 750 and 550 . He also reports on the remains of an Archaic city wall, and he concludes on the basis of finds of Attic ceramic that the site was inhabited in C5m (ibid. 629 -30 ). In a C4source Teichioussa is explicitly classified as a kome (Archestratos fr. 42 ). Leros : the toponym is Λέρος , ηasper (Hdt. 5 . 125 ; Thuc. 8 . 26 . 1 , 27 . 1 ; IG i³ 284 . 16 ). There is also an attestation of the collective and individual use of what may have been a city-ethnic, Λέριος (Demodokos frr. 1 -2 , West (C6 ?). In 454 / 3 , like Teichioussa, Leros provided a temporary home to Milesian democrats loyal to Athens and paid a phoros of 3 tal. ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 21 -22 : Μιλέσιοι εχς Λέρο ). In later years Leros and Teichioussa are recorded by toponym after the Milesioi, and the phoros recorded for all three amounts to 10 tal. ( IG i³ 284 . 15 -17 ( 427 / 6 or 426 / 5 ), 285 . i . 88 -90 ( 421 / 0 ) and 489 . i . 36 -38 ( 416 / 15 )). According to Hdt. 5 . 125 , Hekataios reportedly advised the Milesian epitropos to construct a fortress ( teichos ) on the island, apparently under Milesian control,and wait there for an opportunity to return safely to Miletos. In a C4s honorific decree (Manganaro ( 1963 -64 ) no. 1 ), the inhabitants of the island refer to themselves as τουgraveς εν τηtildeι νήσωι κατοικουtildeντας τῶν πολιτῶν ( 4 , 9 -10 ) or as τῶν οικητόρων τῶν ελ Λέρωι ( 6 ), and it is clear that by that time the inhabitants of the island represented themselves as Milesian citizens. Their assembly, εκκλησία ( 5 ), may have been roughly similar to the assembly of an Athenian deme. See further no. 504 . Ionia Polis (modern Mersinet Iskelesi). There is no evidence pertaining to the Archaic or Classical periods, and Peschlow-Bindokat's assumption that the place existed as a quarry and harbour already in the Archaic period rests entirely on evidence from the Apollo temple at Didyma (( 1977 ) 100 , ( 1977 -78 )). Didyma , alternatively Branchidai (Hdt. 1 . 46 . 2 , 92 . 2 , 157 . 3 , with Ehrhardt ( 1998 )), was located in Milesian territory already in the Archaic period (Hdt. 1 . 46 . 2 ). However, its status in the Archaic and early Classical periods is problematic: Tuchelt ( 1988 ) 430 -31 suggests that Didyma was in fact an independent unit rather than just an extra-urban Milesian sanctuary (see esp. 433 ), but Ehrhardt ( 1998 ) counters that all evidence,including the Sacred Way along with an Archaic sacred law, points to an early connection between the cult site and the polis of Miletos.In C4m the sanctuary minted its own bronze coins. Types: obv . head of Apollo Didymeus, laureate, facing three-quarters l.; rev . lion standing l., looking back at star; legend: ΕΓ ∆Ι∆ΥΜΩΝ ΙΕΡΗ (Head, HN ² 585 ; BMC Ionia 189 ). As far as the territory of Classical Miletos is concerned, Lohmann ( 1997 ) 310 concludes that the minimum size of Milesia proper must have been at least 400 km ² . He reckons that the mountain range south of the Gulf of Akbük provided a natural boundary to the south, but notes that there are still problems connected with fixing the eastern boundary of the territory (ibid. 290 ). Apart from the marble quarries on the eastern Gulf of Latmos, the region lacks any important mineral resources. Good soils exist only on the northern side of Milesia, on a plain between Miletos and Assesos, and around the coasts. The islands, Mt. Grion and most of Milesia are hilly and have poor soils, unsuitable for arable cultivation. However, the deep rich lacustrine soil of the Maiandros valley is extremely fertile and retains moisture well, making it ideal for cereal production (Braun ( 1995 ) 32 -33 ), and it was rephed annually by the flooding of the river Maiandros. This, in addition to probably quite extensive wool production on the uplands,made the territory of Miletos agriculturally productive; and Milesian possessions in the Maiandros valley were the object of several disputes; cf. the C4e arbitration between Miletos and Myous (no. 856 ) concerning territory in the Maiandros valley (Tod 113 ). The size of the Milesian population was undoubtedly considerable already in the Archaic period, although it cannot be calculated with precision. It has been estimated that the early Archaic town may have had about 4 , 000 houses (Gates ( 1995 ) 238 ), undoubtedly an exaggerated figure (Hansen ( 2000 ) 179 n. 208 ). But the eighty Milesian ships at Lade in 494 (Hdt. 6 . 8 . 1 ) and the 2 , 000 hoplites in 424 (Thuc. 4 . 54 . 1 ) testify to a large population. According to a tradition that may go back as early as C7 , Miletos was founded by Neileus (Hdt. 9 . 97 ), whose heroon may have been located just outside the Holy Gate (Herda ( 1998 )). Archaeological evidence points to the existence of a (probably) Ionian Greek settlement from c. 1050 , and there are architectural remains of the Archaic urban centre dating from c. 700 (Greaves ( 2002 ) 75 -79 ). Relatively little is known about the history of Miletos in the early Archaic period, and most of our literary and epigraphical sources are late and unreliable. It is widely assumed that Miletos was ruled by an oligarchy in the period prior to the ascent of the tyrant Thrasyboulos in the last quarter of C7 (e.g. Gorman ( 2001 ) 101 -21 ), but the accounts of the rivalries between different aristocratic families during C8 and C7 all date from the late Heltic and Roman periods. According to Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 , Miletos belonged to the Ionian dodekapolis . During the Archaic period Miletos' relationships with other Greek poleis in the region appear to have been determined to some extent by its enduring hostility towards Samos (no. 864 ), its most significant commercial rival. Hdt. 5 . 99 . 1 implies that Miletos offered military assistance to Eretria (no. 370 ) in Euboia in its war against Chalkis (no. 365 ), mainly on the grounds that Samos was aiding the latter in the so-called Lelantine War (on which see, e.g., Tausend ( 1992 ) 137 -45 ). Miletos formed an alliance with Mytilene (no. 798 ) and perhaps other poleis on Lesbos (Hdt. 3 . 39 . 4 ), from which it received assistance against Samos during the reign of Polykrates, probably c. 530 (see e.g. Tausend ( 1992 ) 86 -87 ). There is also evidence of Milesian engagement in other regional conflicts. In its attempts to resist the invasions of Alyattes in C7 , it was assisted by Chios (no. 840 ), allegedly in return for the help that Miletos had given to Chios in its war against its main rival Erythrai (no. 845 ) (Hdt. 1 . 18 . 3 ). Tausend ( 1992 ) 74 -78 , 83 -85 discusses the evidence for two further Milesian alliances in the Archaic period: one with Erythrai against Naxos (no. 507 ), perhaps in the first half of C7 , and the other with Samos against Priene (no. 861 ) in the first half of C6 . During C7Miletos suffered repeated attacks by the Lydians during the successive reigns of Gyges, Ardys, Sadyattes and Alyattes (Hdt. 1 . 14 . 4 -22 . 4 ). According to Hdt. 1 . 18 . 1 -22 . 4 , the troops of Alyattes invaded Milesian territory for twelve consecutive years, until a treaty of xenia and symmachia was eventually concluded between Alyattes and the Milesian tyrant Thrasyboulos in the twelfth year of Alyattes' reign ( 608 or 598 or 594 ). Herodotos' account of the accidental destruction by fire of the temple of Athena in Assesos (modern Mengerevtepe), which ultimately led Alyattes to end the war on terms favourable to the Milesians, is confirmed by archaeological evidence from the temple site (Lohmann ( 1995 ) 313 -14 ). The treaty may have been upheld by Alyattes' successor Kroisos, but this has been disputed (cf. e.g. Tausend ( 1992 ) 95 -96 ; Gorman ( 2001 ) 123 -24 ). After the Persian conquest of Lydia, Kyros is reported (Hdt. 1 . 141 . 4 ) to have granted the Milesians the same terms as they had previously had with the Lydians, and Herodotos seems to assume that the treaty originally contracted between Alyattes and Thrasyboulos had still been in force during Kroisos' reign. The granting of favourable terms to Miletos by the Lydians and subsequently by the Persians presumably served the purpose of driving a wedge between Miletos with its considerable military strength and the other Ionian poleis . If this was indeed the Lydian and, later, the Persian strategy, it seems to have worked (Hdt. 1 . 141 . 4 ): Miletos held aloof from the Ionian attempt to form a united front against the Persians after 546 . It is widely assumed that Thrasyboulos' reign was followed first by the rule of two further tyrants, Thoas and Damasenor (Plut. Mor . 298 C-D), or by a narrow oligarchy and then by a period of stasis between two factions called 'the Aeinautai' and 'the Cheiromachai' respectively. The stasis referred to by Plutarch is normally identified with the stasis reported in Hdt. 5 . 28 -29 , which was ultimately resolved by an arbitration process conducted by a panel from Paros (no. 509 ). The Parians set up an oligarchy (Hdt. 5 . 28 -29 ). According to Hdt. 5 . 28 , the stasis lasted for two generations, but he gives no precise date for its resolution. It has been suggested that archaeological evidence indicating a decline in Milesian exports in the period 600 -590 may have been directly linked to civil unrest (Greaves ( 2002 ) 96 ). It is normally held that the introduction of the new constitution after the arbitration coincided with the first recorded aisymnetes as a Milesian eponymous official ( Milet . i . 3 122 ; see Gorman ( 2001 ) 112 -13 for a summary of the traditional scholarly position). However, Gorman ( 2001 ) 113 -15 advocates c. 540 rather than the traditional date of 525 as the starting point of the aisymnetes list. She rightly points out that there may well be a gap in the list, reflecting the 15 years separating the Persian sack of Miletos in 494 and the reconstruction of the polis in 479 . However, her argument that the Parian arbitration must be separated from the creation of the office of aisymnetes and instead be moved back to C7 or even C8 rests primarily on the assumptions ( 1 ) that the Persians would not have permitted the resolution of the stasis by the intervention of another Greek polis , and ( 2 ) that a period of a maximum of 25 years between the introduction of the new constitution and the ascent of the tyrant Histiaios before 513 would not have been sufficient to restore Milesian prosperity (ibid. 115 -21 ). Her first premise, at least, must be regarded as debatable: (i) the Milesians may have had more room for regulating their own internal affairs than other Ionian poleis thanks to their favourable treaty with Kyros; (ii) the Persians are later known to have allowed internal conflicts in the Ionian region to be resolved by a process of arbitration conducted by other Greek states (Tod 113 ). From Hdt. 4 . 137 -39 it is clear that the Milesian oligarchy must have been replaced with the Persian-backed tyranny of Histiaios by 513 , when Milesian troops under Histiaios' command assisted the Persians in their Skythian campaign. In return for his services during this campaign Histiaios was granted control of Myrkinos (no. 633 ) by Dareios (Hdt. 5 . 11 . 1 -2 ), and it appears from Herodotos'account that he first settled there.Later he was called to Susa as adviser to the Great King ( 5 . 24 . 2 -25 . 2 ), leaving his cousin and brother-in-law Aristagoras to rule Miletos in his absence (Hdt. 5 . 30 . 2 ). Aristagoras (in secret collaboration with Histiaios, who was detained at Susa) was an important instigator of the Ionian Revolt in 499 , according to Herodotos because he had fallen foul of the Persians as a result of the failed expedition against Naxos (no. 507 ) in 500 and was fearing for his position within Miletos ( 5 . 35 -36 . 1 ). He subsequently stepped down (at least nominally, λόγΩsubiotaω ) as ruler of Miletos and introduced isonomie (Hdt. 5 . 37 . 2 ). This may have amounted to some kind of democracy (but see Gorman ( 2001 ) 136 ). Shortly before the Ionian Revolt was quashed by the Persians in 494 , Aristagoras went into exile, and Histiaios, who attempted to re-establish his position in Miletos, was refused access to the polis (Hdt. 6 . 5 . 1 -2 ). After the Ionian defeat at the battle of Lade, to which the Milesians had contributed eighty ships (Hdt. 6 . 8 ), the Persians subjected the polis to andrapodismos and physical destruction of its urban centre (Hdt. 6 . 18 -20 ). According to Herodotos, most men were killed, and women and children enslaved. The people who were spared were resettled in Ampe on the Red Sea. The territory around the city and the plain were occupied by Persians,while the rest was settled by Karians. However,Herodotos'claim that Miletos 'was emptied of Milesians' may either be exaggerated or may refer more narrowly to Miletos' urban centre ( contra Gorman ( 2001 ) 145 -47 ). In any case, Milesian troops were present among the Persian forces just before the battle of Mykale (Hdt. 9 . 99 . 3 , 104 ). The physical destruction of Miletos city in 494 , on the other hand, appears to have been almost total (but see Voigtländer ( 1984 ) 156 -58 ). Archaeologically, continuity of occupation at the site in C5f cannot be proved or disproved. After the defeat of the Persians at Mykale, Miletos became a member of the Delian League in 478 . It is recorded in the list from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 iii . 19 ; Piérart ( 1974 )), where Milesioi from Leros and from Teichioussa are also recorded as payers ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 19 -22 ). Then the Milesioi are recorded from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . ii . 28 ) to 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . i . 14 ) paying first 10 tal. ( IG i³ 263 . v . 18 ) and from 443 / 2 5 tal. ( IG i³ 269 . i . 33 ). From 427 / 6 ( IG i³ 284 . 15 -17 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 36 -38 ) the Milesians are recorded with Leros and Teichioussa paying 10 tal., and in 415 / 14 the Milesians are recorded alone paying 10 tal. ( IG i³ 290 . i . 9 ). The Milesians were assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 alongside Leros and Teichioussa ( IG i³ 71 . i . 125 ). As a member of the Delian League Miletos provided an army contingent for the Athenian expedition against Corinth (no. 227 ) in 425 / 4 (Thuc. 4 . 42 ), and the Athenians had at their disposal more than 2 , 000 Milesian hoplites in 424 (Thuc. 4 . 54 . 1 ). Milesian troops also participated in the Sicilian expedition (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 4 ). There is no secure evidence for the constitution of Miletos in the period between 479 and c. 450 , but it is normally held that the form of constitution was an oligarchy (perhaps moderate, so Gehrke, Stasis 114 ). The Milesian banishment decree ( Milet . i . 6 187 = ML 43 ), traditionally dated 470 -440 , banishes a number of prominent Milesians and contains provisions for rewarding anyone who kills them. Although it cannot be ruled out completely that the decree was passed after a stasis that may have brought Milesian democrats to power, and that it was directed against leading oligarchic figures, the board of officials referred to as the epimenioi is normally taken to be a feature of Milesian oligarchy (e.g. ML 43 ; Koerner ( 1993 ) 311 ; Gorman ( 2001 ) 232 -34 ). It is possible that the provisions of the decree were directed by an established oligarchy against Medising members of the Milesian élite. It is clear, however, that Miletos experienced a period of civil unrest in the middle of C5 , and that the Athenians intervened on at least one occasion. [Xen]. Ath. Pol . 3 . 11 refers to a situation in which the Athenians chose to back the Milesian oligarchy against the demos ; the oligarchs subsequently revolted and massacred the demos . It is impossible to date the incident from [Xen.]'s text alone, but it may be connected with the passing of IG i³ 21 (conventionally dated to 450 / 49 ), which contains Athenian regulations for Miletos. An Athenian garrison was imposed on Miletos, but it cannot be determined if democracy was also imposed (Gorman ( 2001 ) 227 -30 , contra , e.g., Hornblower ( 1991 ) 188 -89 ). IG i³ 21 is normally interpreted as an Athenian attempt to prop up an existing oligarchy, which may later have revolted and instigated the massacre that led to further Athenian intervention and the imposition of democracy. A terminus ante quem for the introduction of democracy at Miletos is provided by Klio 52 ( 1970 ) 165 -73 (dated to the 430 s), which contains regulations for the sanctuary of Poseidon Helikonios, and which carries a preamble indicating the existence of political institutions on an Athenian model (see e.g. Rhodes, DGS 379 ). Gorman ( 2001 ) 236 argues for the likelihood that a democracy was already in place when the Athenians chose to back Miletos in its conflict with Samos 'over Priene'in 441 / 0 (Thuc. 1 . 115 . 2 ). In 412 the Milesians revolted against Athens (Thuc. 8 . 17 . 1 -4 ), but the democratic constitution remained in place until 405 , when it was replaced by an oligarchy (Diod. 13 . 104 . 5 ; Plut. Lys . 8 ). In 411 the Milesians countered an Athenian attack on their city with a force consisting of 800 hoplites (Thuc. 8 . 25 . 2 ), and further assisted the Peloponnesians with ships (Thuc. 8 . 61 . 2 ) and infantry (Thuc. 8 . 79 . 4 ). In 405 the Spartans helped the Milesian oligarchs to overthrow the democracy, and more than 1 , 000 democrats fled from Miletos and were resettled in Blaundos in Lydia by the Persian satrap Pharnabazos (Diod. 13 . 104 . 6 : Βλαυtildeδα ). Xen. An . 1 . 1 . 7 reports that Tissaphernes attacked the pro-Spartan party in the city because he feared that they might support Kyros,killing and exiling most of them.From LSAM 45 ( = SGDI 5496 ( 380 / 79 )) it may be inferred that the rule of the pro-Spartan oligarchs was replaced by a democracy possibly as a result of Tissaphernes' interference. The preamble of the law shows that by 380 / 79 the Milesian political institutions were set up on an Athenian model (Rhodes, DGS 379 ). In C4m Miletos was probably ruled by the Karian dynasts, as is indicated by Milesian coins with the legends ΕΚΑ (Hekatomnos) and ΜΑ (Maussolos) (Gehrke, Stasis 116 n. 12 ), and by statues of the Hekatomnids Ada and Idrieus set up at Delphi by the Milesians (Tod 161 B). Many of these changes of constitution took place as a consequence of stasis between opposing factions, thus in 452 , 405 and 402 (Gehrke, Stasis 113 -17 ). Depending on the restorations proposed for the preambles of the decrees Klio 52 ( 1970 ) 165 -73 (C5 ) and LSAM 45 = SDGI 5496 ( 380 / 79 ), the boule at Miletos seems to have resembled that of Athens in its designations of phylai presiding in each prytany. In LSAM 45 , the boule seems to have a probouleumatic function. Hdt. 5 . 29 refers to a αasperλίη (C6 ), and a Milesian assembly was convened by the Spartan general Kallikratidas in 406 (Xen. Hell . 1 . 6 . 8 ). The assembly is also attested in a number of C5 and C4enactments: Klio 52 ( 1970 ) 165 -73 is a C5 decree ( psephisma ) passed by the city of Miletos concerning the cult of Poseidon Helikionios. LSAM 45 = SDGI 5496 ( 380 / 79 ), a psephisma containing regulations for the cult of Artemis, has in the preamble: Κεκροπιgraveς επρυτάνευεν , Φιλίννης επεστάτει , έδοξεν τηtildeι βουληtildeι καιgrave τῶι δή µ ωι , ' Ηράκλειτος εῖπεν ( 1 -5 ). Both decrees show very strong Athenian influence (Rhodes, DGS 379 ). There is evidence for homicide legislation in Milet . vi . 1 187 . 2 -3 = ML 43 (C5m). Milet . i . 3 122 lists officials under the heading οιasperacuteδε µ ολπῶν ηισυacute µ νησαν . These officials ( aisymnetai , also called stephanophoroi ) were clearly eponymous, and the list went back to 525 (Sherk ( 1992 ) 229 -32 ; supra ). Other officials are στρατηγοί ( Milet . i . 3 135 . 36 -37 = Syll . ³ 273 (C4 ); τειχοποιοί ( Milet . i . 3 135 . 30 -31 (C4 )); τα µ ίαι ( Milet . i . 3 135 . 31 ); επι µ ήνιοι ( Milet . vi . 1 187 . 5 = ML 43 (C5m)); πράκτορες ( LSAM 45 . 11 = SDGI 5496 ( 380 / 79 )); and a γρα µµ ατευacuteς , perhaps of the boule ( Klio 52 ( 1970 ) 165 -73 ( 435 / 4 )). The Milesian citizen population was subdivided into two different sets of phylai . Of the six old Attic-Ionic phylai , four are attested in C5sources: the Oinopes, the Hoplethes, the Boreis and the Argadeis ( Syll . ³ 57 . 1 -3 ; PEP Miletos 419 , 420 ), and the existence of the Geleontes and Aigikoreis can be presumed (Jones, POAG 321 ). A different system of at least nine and possibly twelve phylai is attested in sources, some of which date from C4 and one even from 437 / 6 (Herrmann ( 1970 )). At least seven phylai duplicate the Kleisthenic ones: Aiantis, Akamantis, Erechtheis, Kekropis, Leontis, Oineis and Pandionis. The two other known phylai are Asopis and Theseis (Jones, POAG 322 -23 ). Inscriptions of C3 -C1 testify to at least five and perhaps seven demes, of which three are the Argaseis, the Lerioi and the Teichiesseis ( supra 1083 ; Jones, POAG 323 -25 ). Milesian embassies are attested in Thuc. 1 . 115 . 2 (to Athens, 441 / 40 ) and Thuc. 8 . 85 . 4 (to Sparta, 411 ). Proxenia was received from Knidos (no. 903 ) ( I.Knidos 1 . 1 -3 ( 400 -350 )) and from Tanagra (no. 220 ) ( IG vii 524 (C4l/C3e)). Citizenship was given to an individual from Mylasa (no. 913 ) ( SEG 38 1193 ( 330 -320 )), and in C4Miletos also entered into mutual arrangements of isopoliteia with other states: Olbia (no. 690 ) (Gawantka ( 1975 ) no. 18 = Tod 195 (before 323 )); Kyzikos (no. 747 ) (Gawantka ( 1975 ) no. 19 (before 323 )) and Pygela (no. 863 ) (Gawantka ( 1975 ) no. 21 ). Milesian theorodokoi to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) are attested in SEG 23 189 . ii . 12 ( 330 -324 ). Since the Geometric period,Kalabaktepe,a 57 m-high hill to the south of Miletos, was defended and acted as an acropolis for the city ( Milet . i . 8 ; von Graeve ( 1986 ), ( 1987 ), ( 1990 ), ( 1991 ), ( 1992 ), ( 1995 ), ( 1997 ), ( 1999 )). Kaletepe (the Theatre Hill) has also been suggested as a possible acropolis for the ancient city, but here the archaeological evidence has been obscured by a Byzantine castle. Following the destruction of the city in 494 there was significant rebuilding on Kalabaktepe, but it was later abandoned as the city never grew to regain its former size, and the focus of settlement shifted towards the harbours. In connection with his report of Alyattes' attack on Miletos (C7 ), Hdt. 1 . 17 comments that, because of Miletos' control of the sea, a proper siege could not be undertaken by an army.The Persian siege of Miletos after the battle of Lade was from land and sea (Hdt. 6 . 18 ). The city walls are mentioned in Hdt. 6 . 7 and 6 . 18 . Their extent in the Archaic period is much debated ( Milet . i . 8 , ii . 3 ; and Cobet ( 1997 )); but Kalabaktepe appears to have been encircled with walls, and on its summit a second, inner wall has recently been found (Senff et al . ( 1997 )). Whether the Archaic walls extended on to the plain below Kalabaktepe to enclose the whole peninsula is not yet clear (Cobet ( 1997 )). Excavation of the area between Kalabaktepe and the Sacred Gate area is hampered by the great depth of deposits that overlie the ancient remains.Some or all of the lower city may have been enclosed within the city walls to defend the harbour area and secure its sea power (Lang ( 1996 ) 199 -201 ); the city was besieged and taken by Alexander the Great in 334 (Diod. 17 . 22 . 1 -4 ). In Hdt. 1 . 17 and 1 . 21 the asty is referred to explicitly. According to Hdt. 1 . 17 . 2 , there was also significant settlement outside the Archaic urban centre. Archaic Miletos appears to have covered a very large area,perhaps as much as 110 ha (Müller-Wiener ( 1986 ) 98 ), but this area cannot have been covered by contiguous urban settlement. Trial trenching on the plains between Kalabaktepe and the temple of Athena found limited evidence for Archaic settlement here ( Milet . i . 8 39 ff), and the archaeology in other parts of the city is obscured by later buildings. Thus, the estimate of about 4 , 000 houses in the early Archaic town (Gates ( 1995 ) 238 ) must be an exaggeration (Hansen ( 2000 ) 179 n. 208 ). The period 494 to 479 is virtually unattested in the archaeological record; but when the town was rebuilt, the walls were probably planned on the same scale and in the same location as the original Archaic city to enclose the city peninsula and Kalabaktepe. The new city was grid-plan... [truncated]"
855,Myonnesos (Myon(n)esios),Ionia,38.05,26.5,271,1425,"855 . Myonnesos (Myon(n)esios) Map 56 . Lat. 38 . 05 , long. 26 . 50 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: A. The toponym is Μυόννησος , ηasper (Hecat. fr. 232 ; Thuc. 3 . 32 . 1 ) or Μυόνησος (Ephor. fr. 27 ). The city-ethnic is Μυονήσιος (Ephor. fr. 27 ; IG vii 556 (undated)). Myonnesos was probably recorded as a polis in the urban sense in Hekataios' work (fr. 232 ), quoted by Steph. Byz. 462 . 11 -13 : πόλις µ εταξυgrave Τέω καιgrave Λεβέδου . ' Εκαταῖος ΑσίΩsubiotaα . Αρτε µ ίδωρος δεgrave χωρίον αυτήν φησι . The quotation indicates that Hekataios did actually offer a site-classification that was later contradicted by Artemidoros. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested in an external context in Ephor.fr. 27 ( verbatim quotation). Myonnesos was located between Teos (no. 868 ) and Lebedos (no. 850 ) (Strabo 14 . 1 . 29 ), and was, according to Thuc. 3 . 32 . 1 , a T eian possession. The island is very small ( c. 1 km ² ), but Myonnesos may have controlled some of the peraia . The island-or peninsula-settlement of Myonnesos was too small to support a town (Bean ( 1966 ) 146 -49 ). It must have been the equivalent of an acropolis,with the main settlement on the mainland. Like Korykos (no. 849 ), it was a nest of pirates (Ephor. fr. 27 ). The settlement on the small island that formed part of Myonnesos, and which was joined to the mainland by a causeway, contains remains of an early cyclopean wall."
856,Myous (Myes(s)ios),Ionia,37.35,27.25,737,3320,"856 . Myous (Myes(s)ios) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 35 , long. 27 . 25 . Size of territory: unknown but probably 2 or 3 . Type: A. The toponym is Μυacuteης (Hecat. fr. 235 ) or Μυουtildeς , -ντος , οasper (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 , 5 . 36 . 4 ; schol. Thuc. 1 . 138 ); the city-ethnic is Μυήσιος (Hdt. 6 . 8 . 1 ; T od 113 . 33 ) or Μυήσσιος ( IG i³ 71 . i . 153 ( 425 / 4 )). At IG i³ 263 . v . 20 , Μυέβιοι 'is clearly a cutter's error'( ATL i. 522 ). On the (unhistorical) variant Μυουacuteσιος , see Robert ( 1946 ) 71 . Myous is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 ) and in the political sense (Hdt. 1 . 141 . 4 , 142 . 3 , 143 . 3 ; SEG 45 1619 . 4 , 12 -13 (C4l/C3e)), in which the use of the polis cognate polites is also found ( 12 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on C4 coins ( infra ) and in SEG 45 1619 . 3 (C4l/C3e)), and externally in literary sources (Hdt. 6 . 8 . 1 ) and in inscriptions ( IG i³ 71 . i . 153 ; T od 113 . 33 ( 391 -388 )). The individual and external use is attested on a late Classical funerary monument set up at Athens ( IG ii² 9973 ). Not much is known about the extent of Myesian territory in the Classical period. The only piece of evidence is Tod 113 ( 391 -388 ), recording an arbitration concerning land in the Maiandros valley to which Miletos (no. 854 ) and Myous had both laid claim. The Myesians lost the case by default. In 494 Myous provided three ships for the battle of Lade (Hdt. 6 . 8 . 1 ), and it seems to have been under Persian control even after the establishment of the Delian League: the Persian king granted tax-levying rights at Myous to Themistokles during the latter's exile (Thuc. 1 . 138 . 5 ). Myous was a member of the Delian League.It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . ii . 30 ) to 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . i . 15 , mostly restored) a total of eleven times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 tal. ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 12 , restored in all other lists) but 1½ tal. in 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . ii . 30 , conj.) and in 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . i . 62 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 138 ). A C4l/C3e grant of proxenia and of citizenship is attested in SEG 45 1619 , the sole surviving public enactment ( ψήφισ µ α , ll. 16 -17 ) passed by the boule and demos of Myous (ll. 10 -11 ). This decree also contains a grant of ateleia (ll. 5 -6 ). Because of the absorption of Myous into Miletos (no. 854 ) in the Heltic period, very little remains on the site, the ruins of which may have been used as a quarry after the polis had ceased to exist (Bean ( 1966 ) 246 ). The site was surveyed by H.Weber in 1964 and 1966 . Weber ( 1965 ) reports on two temples, an 'upper'and a 'lower' , of which he assumed that the upper temple was the older one, dating from C6m. A sanctuary of Apollo is attested in SEG 45 1619 . 18 . Myous struck coins of silver and bronze in C4 . ( 1 ) Silver hemiobol on the Attic standard: types: obv . head of Apollo laureate, facing r.; rev . lion with raised paw; legend: ΜΥ . ( 2 ) Bronze: obv . Poseidon laureate; rev . goose, or bow and arrow, or dolphin and trident; legend: ΜΥ or ΜΥΗ (Babelon, Traité ii. 2 . 1057 -60 , no. 1773 ; Head, HN ² 587 ; SNG von Aulock nos. 2114 -15 ; SNG Cop. Ionia 1022 )."
857,Naulochon,Ionia,37.4,27.15,420,2143,"857 . Naulochon Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 40 , long. 27 . 15 . Size of territory: unknown but probably 1 or 2 . Type: probably A ( infra ). The toponym is Ναυacuteλοχον , τό ( I.Priene 1 = Tod 185 . 2 ( 334 ); SEG 23 189 . ii . 10 ( 330 -324 )). A city-ethnic may be attested in abbreviated form on the C4 coins ( ΝΑΥ , infra ). Naulochon is probably called a polis in the urban sense in I.Priene 1 . 6 (van Berchem ( 1970 ) 200 -1 ; Hornblower ( 1982 a ) 327 ); but the interpretation of this inscription is open to debate (Heisserer ( 1980 ) 162 ). Likewise,the dedication to the hero Naulochos as 'protector of the polis ' ( πόλειως φυacuteλακογ in CEG ii 854 . 5 = I.Priene 196 (C4m)) may be an attestation of Naulochon (and not Priene (no. 861 )) as a polis in the political sense. Naulochon was the port of Priene and seems to have existed as a separate community during part of C4 . However, the edict of Alexander the Great seems to equate the Greek inhabitants of Naulochon with the Πριηνεῖς , suggesting that there was no separate Naulochean communal identity. Depending on how the text is restored, the decree may also be interpreted to the effect that some of the inhabitants were not Greek at all (Heisserer ( 1980 ) 156 ; Botermann ( 1994 )). If it is accepted that Priene had ceased to exist at some point after 391 / 0 , to be revived as a community only after the refoundation of the city, then Naulochon may have served as a temporary urban and political centre of the Prienians (van Berchem ( 1970 ) 200 -1 ; Hornblower ( 1982 a ) 327 ). However, the numismatic evidence points to Prienian coins having been minted simultaneously with coins minted by Naulochon, a problem not solved satisfactorily by van Berchem's argument. Theorodokoi to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) are attested for Naulochon in SEG 23 189 . ii . 10 ( 330 -324 ). Naulochon struck bronze coins in C4m.Types: obv . head of Athena r.; rev . dolphin r., surrounded by maeander pattern; legend: ΝΑΥ (Babelon, Traité ii. 2 . 1059 -60 no. 1776 ; Head, HN ² 587 ; for one contemporary silver coin with the same types but inscribed ΠΡ , see Regling ( 1927 ) 47 )."
858,Notion (Notieus),Ionia,38.0,27.1,807,3849,"858 . Notion (Notieus) Map 56 . Lat. 38 . 00 , long. 27 . 10 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Νότιον , τό (Hecat. fr. 233 ; Thuc. 3 . 34 . 1 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 5 . 12 -14 ; Hell . Oxy . 8 . 4 , Chambers; Ps.-Skylax 98 ). The city-ethnic is Νοτιευacuteς ( IG i³ 261 . v . 11 ( 452 / 1 )). Notion is called a polis in the urban sense, explicitly at Hell . Oxy . 8 . 4 , unless the reference is to Kolophon (no. 848 ) (see Bruce ( 1967 ) 44 ), and implicitly at Ps.-Skylax 98 : Νότιον καιgrave λι µ ήν (see Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 . At Arist. Pol . 1303 b 7 -10 Notion is listed as an example of a community which was sometimes a separate polis . The collective and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in Attic inscriptions (the tribute lists and IG ii² 1 . 48 = Tod 97 ( 403 / 2 )). Although it cannot be ruled out completely that Notion in Ionia was in fact identical with the Aiolic Notion ('Southern') mentioned in Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 , its history was inextricably bound up with that of Kolophon (no. 848 ), for which it served as a harbour town. Thus, the preferable view is that Aiolic and Ionian Notion were different communities. Notion was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 22 ) to 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 41 ) a total of eighteen times, four times completely restored, paying a phoros of 2 , 000 dr. in all years, except in 428 / 7 when it paid only 100 dr. ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 23 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 107 , toponym mostly restored). It is recorded once by toponym ( IG i³ 285 . i . 95 ), and otherwise by city-ethnic. In some years Notion and Kolophon are listed side by side ( 454 / 3 -452 / 1 and 433 / 2 -416 / 15 ), but in the period 451 / 0 -440 / 39 the two communities are separated by two entries ( IG i³ 270 . i . 8 and 11 ) or four entries ( IG i³ 262 . iv . 6 and 12 ) or five entries ( IG i³ 266 . i . 4 and 10 ) or even more. Thuc. 3 . 34 . 1 refers to Notion in unambiguous terms as a Kolophonian dependency in 428 / 7 ( εις Νότιον τοgrave Κολοφωνίων ). But in the Athenian decree for the Samians of 403 / 2 , the Notieis are honoured by Athens along with the people of Ephesos (no. 844 ) for having given asylum to Samian refugees ( IG ii² 1 . 48 ). This points to Notion as a state in its own right (in that case a dependent polis ), at least at the turn of the century. Status as a separate community is also indicated by the much later attestation of theorodokoi in Notion, one to host theoroi announcing the festival for Argive Hera ( SEG 23 189 . ii . 7 ( 330 -324 )) and one to host theoroi announcing the Nemean Games ( SEG 36 331 . ii . 44 -45 ( 323 / 2 )). Finally, at Pol . 1303 b 7 -10 Aristotle notes that problems with the nature of the territory resulted in stasis between the Kolophonians and the Notieis and made it difficult to keep the polis united. Aristotle's use of ethnics indicates that Kolophon and Notion were sometimes united, sometimes separate communities. For the problem relating to the Athenian foundation of a New Kolophon at Notion, see 1078 supra . Even if New Kolophon was founded on the actual site of Notion, the community of Notieis must have retained a communal identity distinct from that of the Kolophonian settlers, as pointed out by Piérart ( 1984 ) 168 -71 . During their excavation of Notion, Demangel and Laumonier ( 1923 ) recorded some C4 architectural fragments which may have belonged to the Athena sanctuary. A fortificatory wall ( diateichisma ) is mentioned in Thuc. 3 . 34 . 2 ; but this may have been only of a temporary nature. There is so far no evidence for Classical city walls. Recent Turkish excavations, reported by Mitchell ( 1999 ) 148 , produced no further evidence for the pre-Heltic settlement."
859,Phokaia (Phokaieus),Ionia,38.4,26.45,1396,6622,"859 . Phokaia (Phokaieus) Map 56 . Lat. 38 . 40 , long. 26 . 45 . Size of territory: probably 3 . Type: A. The toponym is Φώκαια , ηasper (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 , 2 . 178 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 1 ) or Φωκαίη (Hdt. 1 . 80 . 1 ) or, in the Aiolic dialect, Φώκα (Tod 112 . 9 -10 = SEG 34 849 (C5 -C4 )). The city-ethnic is Φωκαιευacuteς (Hdt. 4 . 138 . 2 ; Thuc. 1 . 13 . 6 ; IG i³ 261 . v . 4 ) or Φωκαευacuteς (C4 bronze coins, infra ). Phokaia is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 1 . 162 . 2 -163 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 98 ) and in the political sense (Hdt. 2 . 172 . 2 ; Tod 112 . 6 , 17 ; Arist. Oec . 1348 b 4 ). A Φωκαίων πολιτεία was included among the 158 Aristotelian constitutions (fr. 616 ). The word astos is used about the citizens of Phokaia in Hdt. 1 . 165 , and patris is used in Hdt. 1 . 169 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C4 coins ( infra ) and externally in Hdt. 6 . 8 . 2 ; Thuc. 1 . 13 . 6 ; Isoc. 6 . 84 ; IG i³ 261 . v . 4 . For the individual and external use, see Hdt. 6 . 11 . 1 ; CID ii 4 . iii . 13 (C4m) and IG ii² 2421 . 2 (C4 ). The name of the territory was Φωκαιdieresisacuteς (Thuc. 8 . 101 . 2 ). It included an island with a harbour called οasper εν Καρτερίοις λι µ ήν (Thuc. 8 . 101 . 2 ) (a harbour is mentioned also at Ps.Skylax 98 ). Karteria was most likely (a group of) island(s), and it is interesting to note that even islands could be described as part of Phokaïs. At Hdt. 1 . 165 . 3 the term χώρη is used about Phokaia's territory as a whole. The colonisation of Massalia (no. 3 ) by Phokaians in c. 600 is the first thing we know about Phokaia ( supra 162 , 165 ), and according to Thuc. 1 . 13 . 6 , Phokaia then possessed a strong naval force. After the Persian conquest of the Lydian kingdom, the Phokaians decided to relocate their city and, according to Hdt. 1 . 164 , the majority of the citizens left c. 546 . He also relates that many of them became homesick soon after and returned to Phokaia in spite of their solemn oath never to come back. The abandonment and destruction of Phokaia in 546 now seems to be confirmed archaeologically (Mitchell ( 1999 ) 143 ). Phokaia belonged to the Ionian dodekapolis (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 ) and provided three ships for the battle of Lade (Hdt. 6 . 8 . 2 ) as well as the general of the whole fleet, Dionysios (Hdt. 6 . 11 . 1 ). Andrapodismos of Phokaia as a consequence of the defeat at Lade may be implied in Hdt. 6 . 17 in his account of the general Dionysios' decision not to return home. Phokaia was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . viii . 7 -8 , 9 ) to 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . i . 49 , mostly restored) a total of twelve times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 3 tal. down to, probably, 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 38 ), then 1 tal., 5 , 250 dr. ( IG i³ 266 . i . 11 ) and from, perhaps, 443 / 2 ( IG i³ 269 . i . 14 ) 2 tal. ( IG i³ 270 . i . 12 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 139 ). In 453 / 2 the tribute is split up into one payment of 3 , 000 dr. and one of 2 tal., 3 , 000 dr. The only public enactment attested earlier than C3 is T od 112 (C5l/C4e).Lines 6 -18 of this decree also provide evidence for dikasterion , death penalty and fines. The eponymous official is recorded as πρυacuteτανις (Tod 112 . 19 -21 ), and other officials are referred to as αρχαί generally in ll. 9 -10 . A Phokaian grant of ateleia may be attested in Iscr. Cos ED 71 B. 15 -17 (C4l). Proxenia was received from Chios (no. 840 ) ( RPhil ( 1937 ) 325 -32 no. 6 A. 2 = PEP Chios 50 (C4 )). On the C5s coinage treaty (Tod 112 ) with Mytilene (no. 798 ), see infra . Hdt. 1 . 162 -64 (r 546 ) recounts how the Phokaians fortified their settlement with financial assistance from Arganthonios, king of Tartessos, and describes the city wall as several stades long and constructed from large blocks of stone. In 1990 , part of the city wall was found near the new city hall of Foça (Mellink ( 1993 ) 131 ). For the results of excavations of the Archaic city wall, see Özyigit ( 1994 ). They seem to have enclosed an area of c. 50 ha. The archaeological evidence in general appears to confirm Herodotos'account, including a burnt city gate and C6 debris which suggest an attack c. 540 . In Xen. Hell . 1 . 5 . 11 the text suggests that the Athenians attempted to fortify Phokaia in 406 , and the text need not be emended (Krentz ( 1989 ) 139 ). Old Phokaia is currently under excavation, and remains of public architecture have been discovered. An Archaic temple of Athena is thought to have been located on a rock platform at the tip of the peninsula (Mellink ( 1955 ) 236 , ( 1956 ) 382 ; E. Akurgal ( 1956 ) 6 -8 ). It is assumed that this temple was destroyed by Harpagos and perhaps repaired shortly afterwards. The ceramic record runs from late Geometric throughout the Classical period. In Xen. Hell . 1 . 3 . 1 it is reported that the temple of Athena burned in 409 / 8 . The temple appears to have been rebuilt in the Heltic period. Archaic walls of a Cybele sanctuary were discovered by Özyigit (Gates ( 1996 ) 325 ). A C4e-m theatre is currently under excavation (Mitchell ( 1999 ) 143 ). Phokaia struck coins of electrum, silver and bronze. ( 1 ) Electrum, C6 -C4 : denominations: stater, hekte. Types: obv . a variety of types with seal above or below; rev . quadripartite incuse square. ( 2 ) Silver on the Phoenician standard, C6 -C4 : denominations: tetradrachm, didrachm, drachm and fractions down to hemiobol: obv . variety of types with seal above or below; rev . mostly quadripartite incuse square; legend: sometimes ΦΩ . ( 3 ) Bronze: obv . female head; rev . griffin; only a few C4 bronze coins carry the legend ΦΩΚΑΕΩΝ . In, probably, C5s, Phokaia and Mytilene (no. 798 ) concluded a treaty that the two poleis should take turns and strike identical electrum coins in alternating years ( IG xii . 2 1 ). In C4 the staters and hektai struck in consequence of this treaty became the principal local currency of the poleis of western Asia Minor (Tod 112 = SEG 34 849 ; Head, HN ² 587 -89 ; Jenkins ( 1990 ) 18 -19 ; Bodenstedt ( 1977 -78 a ), ( 1977 -78 b ) with Kraay ( 1982 ); BMC Ionia 203 -16 ; SNG Cop.

It may also have founded Emporion (no. 2 ) c. 600 , possibly in collaboration with Massalia, and Amisos (no. 712 ), possibly in collaboration with Miletos (no. 854 )."

The city-ethnic is either Πολιχναῖος ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 29 , 265 . i . 60 ) or Πολιχνίτης ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 30 ), to be distinguished from the Πολιχνῖται of Chalkidike (no. 596 ) and the Πολιχνῖται (no. 789 ) in the Hellespontine district (i.e. Troas). The location of *Polichne is uncertain,but the community was undoubtedly situated on the Mimas peninsula. Wilamowitz-Möllendorff's attempt ( 1908 ) 617 to identify this Polichne with that of Thuc. 8 . 14 . 3 was disputed by Kirsten ( 1952 ); Cook ( 1953 -54 ) 157 with n. 3 ; and Gomme et al . ( 1981 ) 34 -35 . The Polichnitai were members of the Delian League. They belonged to the Ionian district and are recorded from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 14 ) to 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 30 ) a total of twelve times, once completely but plausibly restored. In 448 / 7 ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 30 ), 444 / 3 ( IG i³ 268 . i . 27 ), 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . i . 23 ) and 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 144 -45 ) the Polichnitai are explictly recorded as a dependency of Erythrai (no. 845 ). In 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 14 ) they paid alongside the other Erythraian dependencies; but in 448 / 7 ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 30 ) and in 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 60 ) the other dependencies paid on their behalf. In later years their payment is recorded separately from that of the other Erythraian dependencies, and the Polichnitai paid 4 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 271 . i . 18 ) but in 428 / 7 1 tal., 3 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 30 )."
861,Priene (Prieneus),Ionia,,,2162,10992,"861 . Priene (Prieneus) Map 61 . From C4s, lat. 37 . 40 , long. 27 . 20 ; if relocated (cf. infra ), the precise location of the Archaic and Classical urban centre is unknown. Size of territory: unknown but probably 3 or 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Πριήνη , ηasper (Thuc. 1 . 115 . 2 ; Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 17 ; I.Priene 5 . 8 (C4s)). The city-ethnic is Πριηνευacuteς (Hecat. fr. 233 ; IG i³ 269 . i . 28 ( 443 / 2 ); I.Priene 1 . 7 ( 334 ), 2 . 4 = Tod 186 . 4 ( 334 )) or Πριανευacuteς ( IG i³ 260 . x . 8 ( 453 / 2 )). Priene is called a polis both in the urban sense (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 17 ; Ps.-Skylax 98 ) and in the political sense (Hdt. 1 . 141 . 4 , 142 . 3 , 143 . 3 ; I.Priene 1 . 14 -15 ( 334 ), 2 . 7 ( 334 )). The polis cognate polites is attested in I.Priene 10 . 7 (C4 ), and politeia in I.Priene 2 . 8 ( 334 ) denoting Prienian citizenship. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in decrees ( I.Priene 2 . 4 , 7 , 13 -14 ) or in abbreviated form on C4mcoins ( infra ), and externally in Hecat. fr. 234 ; Hdt. 1 . 15 ; IG i³ 260 . x . 8 . For the individual and external use, see Hipponax fr. 123 , West (C6 -C5 ); Hdt. 1 . 27 . 2 ; and Pl. Prt . 343 A, all referring to Bias of Priene. In C4 the territory of Priene had common borders with the territory of Ephesos (no. 844 ; I.Priene 3 . 13 (C4 -C3e)) and with the territory of Thebes (no. 869 ) on Mt. Mykale ( I.Priene 363 . 24 -25 (C4m)). Ps.-Skylax 98 refers to Priene as a polis with two harbours, one of which was kleistos . Priene was part of the Ionian dodekapolis (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 ) and was traditionally in charge of the Panionian festival located in its territory on Mt. Mykale ( I.Priene 139 . 1 with Hiller von Gaertringen's comment and Strabo 14 . 1 . 20 ). The Panionia were moved from Mt. Mykale to the territory of Ephesos (no. 844 ), perhaps as a result of an early(?) war between Samos (no. 864 ) and Miletos (no. 854 ) over Prienian territory (Hornblower ( 1982 b ), ( 1991 ) 527 -29 ), but were probably transferred back into Prienian control in C4 ( I.Priene 139 (C4m) and PEP Priene 11 (C4m)). Stylianou ( 1983 ) 248 suggested that the move back to Mt. Mykale was initiated in 373 . According to Aeschin. 2 . 116 , Priene filled one of the two Ionian seats in the Amphiktyonic Council, alternating with Eretria (no. 370 ); but see Lefèvre ( 1998 ) 60 . Priene underwent andrapodismos in 546 (Hdt. 1 . 161 ), but had been re-established as a community by 495 / 4 at the latest, when it contributed twelve ships to the battle of Lade (Hdt. 6 . 8 . 1 ). Priene was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 11 ) to 442 / 1 ( IG i³ 270 . i . 21 , completely restored) a total of eight times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 tal. ( IG i³ 263 . v . 22 ). It is absent from the full panel of 440 / 39 ( IG i³ 272 . i -ii . 7 -25 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 149 ). The polis may have been regarded as a potential dependency by both Miletos and Samos, whose fight for domination gave rise to a war and subsequent Athenian intervention on Samos in 440 / 39 (Thuc. 1 . 115 . 2 ). In 398 / 7 troops from Priene assisted Derkylidas in his campaign in the Maiandros plain (Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 17 ), and the latest secure reference to the urban centre of Priene is found in Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 17 , referring to Thibron's movements in the Maiandros plain in 391 / 90 . It is normally assumed that after this point the Prienian citizens abandoned their original (and still unlocated) urban centre in favour of the harbour town of Naulochon until the refoundation of Heltic Priene (Hiller von Gaertringen ( 1906 ) xi ). The question of refoundation and urban relocation, however, is subject to continuous debate. The dates suggested for the refoundation of Priene vary from C4m (implying Athenian or Hekatomnid involve- ment) to 334 (van Berchem ( 1970 ); Hornblower ( 1982 a ) 326 -28 ; Schipporeit ( 1998 )). On a priori topographical grounds it would be very surprising if Archaic and Classical Priene was not located on the same site as the Heltic city. If there was a separate site, one would have expected some trace of it to have been identified or noticed. Demand ( 1990 ) 140 -46 presents important arguments against a relocation and maintains that there is evidence for continuous occupation throughout C4 on the site of Heltic Priene. Botermann ( 1994 ) 165 has refuted some of Demand's arguments, assuming a refoundation by Alexander the Great while still following Demand in suggesting that the urban centre was not necessarily relocated. Botermann's argument rests primarily on the lack of epigraphical material antedating 334 ; but this point could be made for most of the Aiolic and Ionian poleis of Asia Minor and thus is not conclusive. Schipporeit ( 1998 ) adduced further arguments in favour of Demand's position by drawing attention to remains of older constructions at the site of the Demeter sanctuary, the orientation of which does not agree with that of the late Classical temple (( 1998 ) 195 -96 ). Furthermore, as Schipporeit points out (ibid. 202 -3 ), only about a third of Priene has been excavated so far, and this supports Demand's warning against arguments from silence regarding the existence of an earlier settlement on the site. Naulochon (no. 857 ) rather than Priene figures in a list of theorodokoi to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) ( SEG 23 189 . ii . 10 ( 330 -324 )); but the date of the inscription after Alexander's instructions regarding Naulochon ( I.Priene 1 ) weakens the text as evidence against the existence of Priene in C4e-m. I.Priene 5 . 10 -13 (before 326 / 5 , and so roughly contemporary with the list of theorodokoi ) prescribes that theoroi elected by the Prienian demos are to be dispatched to Athens in connection with the Panathenaia. Nothing is known about the constitution of Priene before 334 , and I.Priene 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 are insecurely dated and may belong in C3e (Crowther ( 1996 )). During the last three decades of C4 Priene appears to have been governed by some form of democracy. The decree I.Priene 2 . 3 ( 334 ) mentions an assembly meeting ( κυρίου συλλόγου ). I.Priene 9 . 4 (C4 ) mentions the boule , and its probouleumatic function is securely attested in I.Priene 4 . 52 ( δεδόχθαι τηtildeι βουληtilde [ ι ] κ [ α ] ιgrave [ τῶ ] ι δή µ ωι ( 332 -324 )), but the other attestations of this function in C4 inscriptions ( I.Priene 2 . 1 and 5 . 1 ) are entirely due to Hiller von Gaertringen's not very reliable restorations. The eponymous official is designated prytanis in I.Priene 2 . 4 ( 334 ). For the title of stephanephoros in I.Priene 4 ( 332 -324 ), see Crowther ( 1996 ) 205 -6 . The following types of official are attested epigraphically: a grammateus elected by the assembly ( I.Priene 4 . 6 , commending the 20 -year tenure of this position by Apellis and thus going back at least as far as the last two decades of C4 ) and a board of timouchoi ( I.Priene 10 . 24 ). I.Priene 10 refers to the Prienian administration of justice, which provided for public actions brought by volunteer prosecutors (l. 33 ). A grant of proxenia bestowed on Antigonos of Makedonia, who is also given citizenship, is attested in I.Priene 2 ( 334 ). Shortly before 322 Priene renewed a block grant of citizenship bestowed on the Athenians ( I.Priene 5 . 7 -8 ; see also IG ii² 566 . 7 -8 , presumably referring to the earlier grant). A grant of enktesis ges kai oikias is bestowed on Antigonos of Makedonia in I.Priene 2 . 9 . A distinction between real property owned by the citizens of Priene and property owned by resident non-Prienians in Prienian territory is made in I.Priene 1 . 8 -13 , with a view to taxation imposed by Alexander the Great. Import and export taxes are mentioned in I.Priene 2 . 9 -11 , as well as a general grant of ateleia , but excepting taxes on land, which will still have to be paid by the honorand. On personal taxation in Priene, see Gauthier ( 1991 ), who relies on Hiller von Gaertringen's early dates for I.Priene 4 , and whose other Prienian evidence all belongs to C3 or later. Maronitai resident in Priene are mentioned in I.Priene 10 . 21 , a C4 decree bestowing various judicial privileges on citizens of Maroneia (no. 646 ). Evidence for a group of land-owning, permanent non-Prienian residents designated Pedieis is found in I.Priene 1 . 7 -13 and later in I.Priene 3 (C3e according to Crowther). There is a possibility that Pedieis refers to non-Greek residents in Prienian territory (Corsaro ( 1984 )); but this proposition has been questioned by Schuler ( 1998 ) 205 . The urban centre of Priene was surrounded by walls which can be dated to C4 , although their precise date is disputed (Wiegand and Schrader ( 1904 ) 35 ff; Lawrence ( 1979 ) 119 , 478 ); they enclosed an area of 37 ha, of which 15 ha was suitable for habitation (Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 193 ) and accommodated c. 500 houses (ibid. ( 1994 ) 190 ). The agora of C4 Priene is currently under investigation (Gates ( 1994 ) 269 ). The main sanctuary was that of Athena Polias ( I.Priene 156 : Βασιλευgraveς Αλέξανδρος ανέθηκε τοgraveν ναοgraveν Αθηναίηι Πολιάδι ( c. 334 , but the date is disputed; see Carter ( 1988 ) 133 n. 59 ) and Botermann ( 1994 ) 162 )). The C4 temple of Athena was probably not completed until C3 (Mellink ( 1993 ) 126 -27 ); there can be no doubt, however, that the construction of the temple was begun in the 330 s at the latest. The Demeter sanctuary, which may contain remains predating the refoundation of the city, is discussed by Schipporeit ( 1998 ). For the date of the theatre ( TGR iii. 441 -42 ), see Gogos ( 1998 ), who argues for a date not earlier than C3for the entire structure.With Crowther's redating of I.Priene 4 to C3e, the only written evidence for a C4 theatre disappears ( 32 ). This is also true of the references to a prytaneion in I.Priene 3 . 16 and 4 . 35 -36 . A grid plan is attested from at least C4 (Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 188 -222 ). The Prienian calendar shows close affinities with that of Miletos (no. 854 ) and two of the Attic months are attested in C4 inscriptions: Metageitnion in I.Priene 2 . 2 and Boedromion in I.Priene 10 . 1 -2 (Trümpy, Monat . 94 -96 § 83 ). Prienian bronze coinage is known from at least as early as C4m.( 1 ) Types: obv . Athena wearing helmet; rev . maeander pattern; legend: ΠΡΙΗ . ( 2 ) Obv . head of Athena,l.; rev . dolphin in circle formed by maeander pattern; legend: ΠΡ . Head, HN ² 590 drew attention to the similarity between ( 2 ) and the types minted by Naulochon (no. 857 ). Regling's ( 1927 ) reluctance to date any Prienian issues to the period before C4m has been questioned by Schipporeit ( 1998 ). SNG von Aulock 2151 and SNG Cop. Ionia 1076 (bronze) are dated to 340 -334 . Coins of C2 have the full form of the city-ethnic: ΠΡΙΗΝΕΩΝ ( SNG Cop. Ionia 1100 )."

The toponym is Πτελεόν , τό (Thuc. 8 . 24 . 2 , 31 . 2 ). The cityethnic is Πτελεουacuteσιος ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 30 ( 448 / 7 ); Eust. Il . 297 . 28 ). The settlement is designated as a teichos in Thuc. 8 . 24 . 2 , but this designation does not rule out that Pteleon was a polis . The collective and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in the Athenian tribute lists. Pteleon was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 16 ) to 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . i . 21 ) a total of ten times, three times completely but plausibly restored. In 430 / 29 Pteleon is explictly recorded as a dependency of Erythrai ( IG i³ 281 . i . 20 ). In 450 / 49 , 448 / 7 and 447 / 6 Pteleon paid alongside the other dependencies of Erythrai (no. 845 ); they all formed a syntely, but the Pteleousioi paid on their own behalf ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 16 , 264 . iii . 30 , 265 . i . 64 ). In later years their payment is recorded separately from that of the other Erythraian dependencies, and they seem in all years to have paid 100 dr. ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 20 ). In 425 / 4 Pteleon was assessed for tribute separately from Erythrai and the other Erythraian dependencies ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 93 ). The community was located in Erythraian territory and was undoubtedly an Erythraian dependency (Thuc. 8 . 24 . 2 : εν τηsubiotaηtilde ' ΕρυθραίΩsubiotaα ; IG i³ 281 . i . 21 : [ Πτελεό ] σιοι ' Ερυθραίον ), but the Athenians maintained control over the site during Erythrai's revolt in 412 . The designation τεῖχος in Thuc. 8 . 24 . 2 indicates that Pteleon was walled; see also Thucydides' report at 8 . 31 . 2 of Astyochos' failure to capture the site."
863,Pygela (Pygeleus),Ionia,37.5,27.15,798,3919,"863 . Pygela (Pygeleus) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 50 , long. 27 . 15 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Πυacuteγελα , τά (Hipponax fr. 92 . 15 , West; Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 2 ; SEG 23 189 . ii . 9 ( 330 -324 )) or Φυacuteγελα ( I.Ephesos 3110 . 6 (C4l)). The city-ethnic is Πυγελευacuteς (Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 2 ) or Πυγαλευacuteς ( IG i³ 266 . i . 7 ( 446 / 5 )) or Φυγελευacuteς ( I.Ephesos 3110 . 3 (C4l)). Pygela is attested as a polis in the political sense in I.Ephesos 3110 (C4 ), and retrospectively in the sense of town by Polyaen. 7 . 23 . 2 (rC4 ). The polis cognates polites and politeia in the sense of citizenship are attested in I.Ephesos 3110 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C4 coins ( infra ) and externally in Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 2 ; IG i³ 269 . i . 29 ( 443 / 2 ); I.Ephesos 3110 (C4 ). For the individual and external use of the city-ethnic, see IGBulg . 416 (C5 -C4 ) and Dion. Hal. Thuc . 5 (rC5 ) (referring to Thucydides' predecessor ∆η µ οκληtildeς οasper Φυγελευacuteς ). The χώρα of Pygela is mentioned in Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 2 (r 409 ). I.Ephesos 3111 . 11 -13 ( c. 310 ) records that a grant of citizenship was passed with 350 votes (Gauthier ( 1990 ) 91 -92 ). Pygela was a member of the Delian League.It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 446 / 5 ( IG i³ 266 . i . 7 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 24 ) a total of eleven times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 tal. in 440 / 39 ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 13 ) and 1 tal., 3 , 000 dr. in 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . i . 47 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 151 ). In C4l Pygela entered into an isopoliteia agreement with Miletos (no. 854 ) ( I.Ephesos 3110 ) in which Pygelean envoys to Miletos are honoured ( 2 ). Prior to the isopoliteia agreement Milesian citizens resident at Pygela appear to have enjoyed some form of limited citizenship,perhaps bestowed on them by a block grant. Likewise, Pygelean citizens resident at Miletos seem to have had some privileges. The treaty itself may have extended the civic rights of resident Pygeleans in Miletos:the end of the decree stipulates that the Pygeleans are to be assigned to phylai by lot by the prytaneis (ll. 17 -18 ). I.Ephesos 3111 (C4l) shows that in C4 the Pygelean assembly controlled the admission of new citizens by decree ( psephisma , l. 4 ). The independence of Pygela seems to have been under constant threat from its more powerful neighbours, especially Samos (no. 864 ) and Ephesos (no. 844 ). The latter clearly had absorbed Pygela in the early Heltic period, when the inhabitants of Pygela were referred to as Ephesian citizens ( I.Ephesos 1408 . 2 , 4 -5 ). The civic subdivisions of Pygela were phylai and gene . The phyle Αγα µ ε µ νονίς and the genos Ευρίδαι are attested, and a board of prytaneis are given responsibility for assigning naturalised citizens to civic subdivisions by lot and, together with the tamias , for having the citizenship decree inscribed on stone ( I.Ephesos 3111 . 7 -9 ). Pygela was fortified in 409 (Xen. Hell . 1 . 2 . 2 ). During excavations of the site between Ephesos and Ku  sadası, Gürçay and Akurgal cleared 40 m of the city walls. Sherds dating from C4 were found during this operation (Mellink ( 1976 ) 280 ). A sanctuary of Artemis is attested epigraphically ( I.Ephesos 3111 . 5 -6 ). Pygelean theorodokoi to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) are attested in SEG 23 189 . ii . 9 ( 330 -324 ). Pygela struck coins of silver and bronze throughout C4 .

864,Samos (Samios) (to 365 ),Ionia,37.4,26.55,3847,18791,"864 . Samos (Samios) (to 365 ) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 40 , long. 26 . 55 . Size of territory: 4 ( 468 . 3 km ² ), but probably 5 including the Samian peraia . Type: A. The toponym is Σά µ ος , ηasper (Aesch. Pers . 882 ; Hdt. 3 . 48 . 2 ), denoting both the island (Hdt. 3 . 120 . 3 ) and the city (Hdt. 3 . 54 . 1 ). The cityethnic is Σά µ ιος ( I.Ephesos 115 (C6 ); F.Delphes iii . 4 455 (C5e); Hdt. 1 . 51 . 3 ). In C5Samos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 3 . 54 . 1 ; Thuc. 1 . 116 . 2 ) and in the political sense (Hdt. 3 . 139 . 1 ; Thuc. 8 . 21 ); the territorial sense is sometimes a connotation (Thuc. 4 . 75 . 1 ). In C4 again, both the urban sense (Ps.-Skylax 98 ; Isoc. 15 . 107 . 8 ) and the political sense (Xen. Hell . 2 . 3 . 7 ; Arist. Pol . 1287 a 37 -38 ) are attested. Samos is called asty at Anac. frr. 353 and 448 , Page. The designation polites is applied to citizens of Samos in Hdt. 3 . 45 . 4 (rC6 ) and Xen. Hell . 2 . 3 . 7 , while the Samian politeia in the sense of constitution is mentioned in Thuc. 1 . 115 . 2 ; IG i³ 127 . 19 -20 ( 405 ); and [Arist.] Ath . Pol . 24 . 2 (rC5 ). A Σα µ ίων πολιτεία was included among the 158 Aristotelian constitutions (fr. 591 . 1 ; cf. frr. 588 -95 ). The verb politeuein/poli- teuesthai is used in Thuc. 8 . 73 . 6 and IG i³ 127 . 13 = ML 94 . 13 ( 405 ). In Hdt. 3 . 44 . 2 , 142 . 2 and 143 . 1 Samian citizens are referred to as astoi . For patris referring to Samos, see Hdt. 3 . 140 . 5 and SEG 22 483 . 1 (C4f). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a C5e dedication quoted at Hdt. 4 . 88 . 2 and in abbreviated form on C5l-C4 coins ( infra ), and externally in IG i³ 1365 A. i . 1 (C6 ); Thuc. 7 . 57 . 4 (C5 ); and Arist. Oec . 1350 b 6 . The individual and external use of the city-ethnic is attested in I.Ephesos 115 (C6 ) and IG i³ 1366 (C6 -C5 ). In the collective grant of citizenship by Athens in 405 , the honorands are classified as both Samians and Athenians ( IG i³ 127 . 12 ). The collective form of the city-ethnic is used retrospectively in a number of Samian honorific decrees bestowed on the benefactors of the exiled Samian demos ( IG xii . 6 17 . 5 -6 , 24 . 6 -7 ). The Samian territory in its entirety is referred to as χώρα in Hdt. 6 . 22 . 1 , and it is designated Σα µ ίη in Hdt. 9 . 96 . 1 . A study of the settlement pattern of ancient Samos is given by Shipley ( 1987 ) 231 -68 . Apart from Samos itself, Barr . records only four settlements of the Archaic and Classical periods: Kazania ( Barr ., AC), Manolates ( Barr ., A), Neo Karlovasi ( Barr ., C) and Neokhorion ( Barr ., AC), plus one fort at Ag. Ioannis ( Barr ., AC). The size of the Samian citizen population cannot be ascertained. From the number of Samian ships at Lade in 494 and in the navy in action in 440 , Shipley ( 1987 ) 12 -15 suggests a population figure of 30 , 000 -50 , 000 , including women,resident aliens and slaves. According to Hdt. 5 . 99 . 1 , Samos supported the Chalkidian side in the so-called Lelantine War (C8l?), and Samian forces also assisted the Spartans in a war against the Messenians (Hdt. 3 . 47 . 1 ), presumably the Second Messenian War (C7 ). In C6Samian troops distinguished themselves in the battle at Salamis in Cyprus against Persian and Phoinikian forces (Hdt. 5 . 112 . 1 ). Around 517 the conquest of Samos was allegedly completed successfully by Otanes; the entire population was allegedly killed and the Persians handed over 'an empty island' to Syloson (Hdt. 3 . 147 -49 ); but Otanes repopulated the island soon afterwards. Samos belonged to the Ionian dodekapolis (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 4 ), and the Samians took part in the Ionian Revolt in 499 and provided sixty triremes at the battle of Lade in 494 (Hdt. 6 . 8 . 2 ). After the failure of the Ionian Revolt, which led to the reinstatement of Aiakes II as tyrant with Persian backing, many wealthy Samians went into exile and settled at Zankle (no. 51 ), driving out the Zanklaians (Hdt. 6 . 22 -24 ; Arist. Pol . 1303 a 35 -36 ). The Samians fought on the Persian side in 480 / 79 (Hdt. 8 . 85 ) but joined the Greeks before the battle of Mykale (Hdt. 9 . 90 -92 ) and were accepted as members of the Hellenic League after the battle (Hdt. 9 . 106 . 4 ). Samos was among the earliest members of the Delian League (Hdt. 9 . 106 . 4 ) and, alongside Chios (no. 840 ) and Lesbos, the Samians maintained their status as an autonomos ally of Athens (Arist. Ath . Pol . 24 . 2 , but see Pol . 1284 a 39 -40 ). Y et, in 441 / 0 they revolted after Athenian interference in their war against Miletos (no. 854 ) and their installation of a democratic government on the island (Thuc. 1 . 115 . 2 -3 ). After a protracted siege (Thuc. 1 . 115 . 4 -117 . 2 ) the Samians were forced back into the alliance and had to pull down their walls, surrender their fleet, and pay a large war indemnity (Thuc. 1 . 117 . 3 ; IG i³ 48 = Staatsverträge 159 ). The oligarchs who had left Samos in 441 / 0 during the democratic regime but had returned and instigated the Revolt in 440 (Thuc. 1 . 115 . 4 ) went into exile once again, and many of them settled in Anaia (no. 838 ) (Thuc. 3 . 32 . 2 , 4 . 75 . 1 ; see Gehrke, Stasis 143 -44 ). Samos was now perceived as a tribute-paying member of the alliance (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 4 ), although it is never attested in the Athenian tribute lists. Samos remained a member for the duration of the Peloponnesian War, in spite of two attempted secessions in 412 and 411 staged by the Samian élite, both of which were prevented at the eleventh hour (Thuc. 8 . 21 and 8 . 63 . 3 ). In 412 Samos regained its status as an autonomos member of the League (Thuc. 8 . 21 ). After the Athenian defeat at Aigos potamoi, the Samians massacred their oligarchs (Xen. Hell . 2 . 2 . 6 ) and sent envoys to Athens ( IG i³ 127 . 7 -8 ). Athenian citizenship was conferred on all Samians, but their autonomia was guaranteed ( IG i³ 127 . 11 -18 ). After the end of the Peloponnesian War, a decarchy was imposed on Samos by Lysandros after the expulsion of Samian citizens and the return of oligarchic exiles (Xen. Hell . 2 . 3 . 6 -7 ; Diod. 14 . 3 . 4 -5 ; Shipley ( 1987 ) 131 -33 ). Some of the exiled Samian democrats settled in Notion (no. 858 ) and Ephesos (no. 844 ) ( IG ii² 1 . 48 -49 = Tod 97 ( 403 / 2 )). The Samians displayed their loyalty by dedicating a statue of Lysandros at Olympia (Paus. 6 . 3 . 15 ). Samos presumably remained a Spartan ally until Konon's victory in the battle of Knidos in 394 (Paus. 6 . 3 . 16 ), but Samos was subsequently forced back into an alliance with Sparta in 391 (Diod. 14 . 97 . 3 ). In 366 / 5 Samos was conquered by Timotheos (Isoc. 15 . 111 ; Dem. 15 . 9 ) and turned into an Athenian klerouchy (no. 865 ). Samos was renowned as a hegemonic sea power during the reign of Polykrates (Hdt. 3 . 39 . 3 -4 , 122 . 2 ; Thuc. 1 . 13 . 6 ), who allegedly had 100 pentekonteres and 1 , 000 archers at his disposal (Hdt. 3 . 39 . 3 ), and Samos deployed sixty triremes at the battle of Lade (Hdt. 6 . 8 . 2 , 14 . 2 ). In 440 -439 the Samians had a considerable naval force engaged in their rebellion against the Athenians (Thuc. 1 . 116 . 1 , 117 . 1 -2 ). They were compelled to hand over their fleet after their defeat, but in 406 ten Samian ships under a Samian commander fought in the battle of Arginousai (Xen. Hell . 1 . 6 . 25 , 29 ). A contingent of Samian troops participated in the Sicilian expedition (Thuc. 7 . 57 . 4 ), and Samian strategoi are honoured in IG i³ 127 . 8 . The constitutional history of Samos before Polykrates is obscure.A C6 basileus , Amphikrates (Hdt. 3 . 59 . 4 ), may have been an eponymous official rather than a king (Shipley ( 1987 ) 37 ). On the basis of Plutarch's rather late and anecdotal account at Mor . 303 E-304 C, it is normally assumed that Samos from C7 was ruled by an oligarchy of wealthy landowners (the geomoroi ), that the rule of the geomoroi followed after the murder of the monarch Demoteles, and that the oligarchy remained in place until a successful Samian intervention in a war between the Megarians (no. 225 ) and Perinthians (no. 678 ), when the Samian demos staged a coup and 'liberated' the polis (Shipley ( 1987 ) 39 -41 ). Demoteles may have been a tyrant whose rule represented an interruption of the oligarchy of the geomoroi (ibid. 49 ). However, Thucydides at least confirms that the Samian aristocracy was still referred to as geomoroi as late as 412 , when a ban on intermarriage between the geomoroi and the rest of the Samians was instituted ( 8 . 21 ). The period of tyranny at Samos started in the 590 s with the alleged coup of Syloson I, known only from Polyaen. 6 . 45 . For a reconstruction of the succession of tyrants from Syloson I to Polykrates, see Shipley ( 1987 ) 70 -72 . Polykrates ruled as tyrant of Samos from, probably, the 540 s (ibid. 74 -80 ) until 522 , when he was crucified by Oroites (Hdt. 3 . 125 . 2 -3 ). He first ruled jointly with his two brothers, Syloson II and Pantagnotos, but soon killed Pantagnotos and exiled Syloson II (Hdt. 3 . 39 . 2 ). After Polykrates' death, Maiandrios offered the Samians isonomie (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 ; Raaflaub ( 1985 ) 130 -31 ), but stasis soon broke out, and Syloson II was subsequently installed as tyrant with Persian backing. Aiakes II, the son of Syloson II, had succeeded his father as tyrant by 514 (Hdt. 4 . 138 . 2 ), but he was ousted from the tyranny in 499 , allegedly at the instigation of Aristagoras of Miletos (Hdt. 6 . 13 . 2 ). It is not known what type of regime was set up after his fall, but he was reinstated as tyrant by the Persians again immediately after the Ionian defeat in 494 and presumably ruled until 492 when, allegedly, demokratia was imposed on the Ionian poleis by Mardonios (Hdt. 6 . 43 . 3 ). The last Samian tyrant was Theomestor, who had power handed to him by the Persians in return for his loyalty in the battle of Salamis (Hdt. 8 . 85 . 3 ). The constitution of Samos after the Persian defeat at Mykale was probably oligarchic and may have remained so until replaced by an Athenian-backed democracy in 441 (Thuc. 1 . 115 . 2 -3 ; Ath . Pol . 24 . 2 ). The view that oligarchy was introduced only in 454 / 3 (Barron ( 1966 ) 89 ) is countered by Gehrke, Stasis 140 n. 3 . Samos probably remained democratic until the end of the Peloponnesian War (Hornblower ( 1991 ) 192 -93 ), in spite of the oligarchic threat in 412 and 411 (Thuc. 8 . 21 , 73 . 2 ). Oligarchy was imposed on Samos by Lysandros after the Athenian defeat in 404 (Xen. Hell . 2 . 3 . 6 -7 ), and it may have remained oligarchic even after the battle of Knidos in 394 (Gehrke, Stasis 144 -45 ), and right down to 365 , when the Athenians set up their klerouchy on the island. The Samian political institutions are poorly known since, so far, not one single public enactment antedating 365 has been found. A Samian boule is attested in IG i³ 127 . 8 ( 405 ), while a Samian assembly ( ekklesie ) was allegedly convened by Maiandrios after Polykrates' death in 522 (Hdt. 3 . 142 . 2 ). Anhonorific decree passed by the koinon of the Samians and set up in the Samian agora after the battle of Lade is mentioned in Hdt. 6 . 14 . 3 , and Samian nomoi are referred to in IG i³ 127 . 15 . In IG xii . 6478 (C5 ) Telesandros and Demagores are attested as elected supervisors of a public construction of a bridge. A board of gynaikonomoi is attested in IG xii . 6 461 (C4f). The only thing known about civic subdivisions is that the citizens of Perinthos (no. 678 ), a Samian colony, were subdivided into the six Ionian phylai . It seems reasonable to presume that the system was taken over from the metropolis (Jones, POAG 195 -97 ). The well-attested subdivision of the citizen body into phylai , chiliastyes , hekatostyes and gene ( IG xii . 6 18 . 21 -23 (C4l)) was introduced after the expulsion of the Athenian klerouchs in 322 / 1 (Jones, POAG 195 -97 ; Shipley ( 1987 ) 284 -92 suggests an earlier date). In C4l the Samians granted proxenia to a citizen of Gela (no. 17 ) ( IG xii . 6 33 ), and a grant of proxenia was received from Athens (no. 361 ) by Pronos Thyionos Samios ( SEG 37 70 = IG ii² 64 + 425 + 293 ( 375 -350 )). A block grant of Athenian citizenship was received by the entire Samian population in 405 ( IG i³ 127 ). The earliest recorded Samian grants of proxenia and/or citizenship date from the period after 322 . The following funerary monuments commemorate non-citizens who were presumably buried in Samos in the period before the Athenian klerouchy: PEP Samos 521 (Miletos (C5 )); PEP Samos 548 (Kolophon (C5 )); and PEP Samos 571 (Kyzikos (C5 )). The Samian acropolis, which was apparently fortified in C6 , is attested in Hdt. 3 . 143 . 1 , 144 and 146 . 2 . An Archaic city wall is attested in Herodotos' account of Polykrates ( 3 . 39 . 4 ) and the Spartan siege of Samos in 524 ( 3 . 54 . 1 -2 ). The urban centre of Samos may well have remained fortified until the Athenians forced the Samians to demolish their walls in 439 / 8 (Thuc. 1 . 117 . 3 ). Samos was still ateichistos in 411 (Thuc. 8 . 51 . 2 ), when the Athenians had to fortify the city in a hurry in the face of an (allegedly) impending attack by Peloponnesian forces (Thuc. 8 . 51 . 2 ). Samos was also fortified in C4f (Arist. Oec . 1350 b ; Diod. 16 . 21 . 2 ). Kienast ( 1978 ) 94 -103 identifies three building phases for the walls: the first in polygonal masonry (the Archaic wall), the second in ashlar masonry (presumably C4e and at any rate earlier than 290 ), and the third in pseudo-polygonal masonry. The city wall encompassed an area of c. 103 ha. A Samian agora is mentioned in Hdt. 3 . 42 . 2 (rC6s) (probably anecdotal) and Hdt. 6 . 14 . 3 . A proasteion is mentioned in Hdt. 3 . 54 . 1 and 142 . 2 . The mole in the harbour of Samos, attributed to Polykrates by Hdt. 3 . 60 . 3 , has been located through underwater surveys in 1988 ( BCH 113 ( 1989 ) 673 ). Other large-scale public works assigned to Polykrates' reign are ship sheds (Hdt. 3 . 45 . 4 ) and the famous Eupalinos tunnel (Hdt. 3 . 60 . 1 -2 ; Kienast ( 1995 )). A bouleuterion is mentioned by Plut. Mor . 304 Bin connection with the Samian people's coup against the ruling oligarchs c. 700 . An Archaic fountain house was published in Tölle-Kastenbein ( 1975 ) 212 (see further Giannouli ( 1996 )). A theatre is mentioned in a C4l honorific decree ( IG xii . 6 150 . 3 ). Of sanctuaries the most famous was the Heraion, located outside the urban centre. The first Heraion can be dated as early as C8 , and it was replaced by a C7structure. The construction of the so-called Rhoikos temple began c. 575 but was soon replaced by the monumental Heraion praised in Hdt. 3 . 6 . 4 . Construction appears to have begun during the last three decades of C6 , and it was apparently not finished earlier than the end of C6 (Kyrieleis ( 1981 ); Klose ( 1999 ) 361 -63 ). An Artemis sanctuary is attested in Hdt. 3 . 48 . 3 (rC6 ) and on the C5 -C4 horos IG xii . 6 266 . Hdt. 3 . 142 . 2 contains an account of the construction of an altar and temenos for Zeus Eleutherios by Maiandrios (rC6 ); but see Raaflaub ( 1985 ) 139 -40 , but see Thuc. 2 . 74 . 1 ). According to Paus. 2 . 31 . 6 and Diod. 1 . 98 . 5 -6 , Samos also contained a sanctuary of the Pythian Apollo. IG xii . 6238 -44 are C5 horoi of the sanctuary of Athena Athenon medeousa , while IG xii . 6 245 -46 are C5 horoi of the sanctuary of Ion Athenethen . IG xii . 6527 and 528 are C5 -C4 altars of Apollo Nymphegetes. According to Hdt. 3 . 48 . 3 , the Samians instituted a festival for Artemis after their successful attempt to rescue a number of children from Korkyra whom Kypselos was exporting to Sardis. Another important festival was the Heraia, temporarily renamed the Lysandreia after the end of the Peloponnesian War (Douris ( FGrHist 76 ) frr. 26 , 71 ). Three Olympian victors from Samos are known: Olympionikai 123 ( 532 ), 399 ( 380 ) and Skaios, son of Duris, who apparently participated during the Samians' period in exile from their island (Paus. 6 . 13 . 5 ). SEG 22 483 (C4f) may commemorate a Samian victor in the Pythian Games (but εκ Σα µ ίης is restored). The Samians set up a statue in honour of Lysandros in Olympia (Paus. 6 . 3 . 14 -15 (rC5l)), while F.Delphes iii . 4 455 (C5e) is a communal dedication by the Samians to Apollo at Delphi. A C6 kerykeion was found in the Heraion ( AM ( 1972 ) 138 -39 ), and two others are listed in the inventory of the treasurers of the Heraion of 346 / 5 ( IG xii . 6 261 . 53 ). Samos struck coins of electrum, silver and bronze, c. 600 -365 . ( 1 ) Electrum coins on the Euboic standard, c. 600 -525 : denominations: stater and fractions down to sixth. Types: obv . no recognisable type; rev . incuse square and on coins of higher denominations one or two parallel incuse rectangles (Barron ( 1966 ) 15 -16 ). According to Hdt. 3 . 56 . 2 , Polykrates bribed Spartan forces to lift their siege of the island in 525 or 524 with lead coins plated with gold. Some of these fake coins have survived (Barron ( 1966 ) 17 -18 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) nos. 68 -69 ). ( 2 ) Silver coins first on the Euboic and later on the Lydo-Milesian standard, c. 530 -439 : denominations: drachm, triobol, diobol. Obv . forepart of winged boar; rev . lion's head or scalp. ( 3 ) Silver coins, c. 479 -439 : denomination: tetradrachm. Obv . lion's scalp; rev . head and neck of bull; legend: ΣΑ . ( 3 ) Silver coins, c. 439 -408 : denominations: tetradrachm, trihemiobol. Obv . lion's head or scalp; rev . forepart of bull and olive branch, or ram's head and olive branch. ( 4 ) Silver, 408 -365 : denominations: tetradrachm, drachm, hemidrachm, diobol, obol. Obv . lion's scalp; rev . forepart of bull and olive branch, or prow of Samian galley; legend: ΣΑ or ΣΑΜΙ and monogram or magistrate's name. ( 4 ) Bronze coins, 394 -365 : obv . Hera wearing stephane; rev . lion's scalp; legend: ΣΑ (Barron ( 1966 ); SNG Cop. Ionia 1673 -96 ). The Samians were active colonisers, founding Kelenderis (no. 1008 ) in C8l, Nagidos (no. 1010 ) at an unknown date, Perinthos (no. 678 ) in 602 , and Bisanthe (no. 673 ) in C6 (?). In the reign of Amasis Samians took part as co-colonisers of Naukratis (no. 1023 ), where they had their own sanctuary of Hera (Hdt. 2 . 178 . 3 ); another Samian settlement in Egypt was Oasis (no. 1024 ), founded at an unknown date. Samian exiles, including Polykrates'brother Syloson,participated in a refoundation of Kydonia (no. 968 ) in Crete in C6l. Other foundations probably or possibly of Samian origin are Samothrake (no. 515 ), c. 700 ; Dikaia (no. 643 ), C6 ; Nymphaion (no. 704 ), 560 s; and the three poleis on Amorgos: Aigiale (no. 471 ), Arkesine (no. 472 ) and Minoa (no. 473 ), founded at an unknown date."
865,Samos (the  klerouchy  of 365 -322 ),Ionia,,,1065,5065,"865 . Samos (the klerouchy of 365 -322 ) In 366 / 5 an Athenian squadron under Timotheos conquered Samos after a siege of eight months (Isoc. 15 . 11 ; Dem. 15 . 9 ). The Samians were expelled (Diod. 18 . 18 . 9 ; Heracl. Lemb. 35 ; Arist. no. 129 ; Habicht in Hallof and Habicht ( 1995 ); IG xii . 6 42 . 10 -30 ). Subsequently three contingents of Athenian klerouchs were sent to the island: in 366 / 5 (Diod. 18 . 18 . 9 ; Arist. fr. 143 . 1 no. 35 ), in 361 / 0 (Aeschin. 1 . 53 with schol.) and in 352 / 1 (Philoch. fr. 154 ). One of the three contingents alone numbered 2 , 000 klerouchs (Arist. fr. 143 . 1 ; Strabo 14 . 1 . 18 ; see Cargill ( 1995 ) 17 -21 ; Habicht in Hallof and Habicht ( 1995 ) 286 -88 ( 301 -303 )). The exiled Samians settled in different poleis all over the Aegean, and some undoubtedly set up home on the former Samian peraia , especially at Anaia ( IG xii . 6 42 , 43 ). A series of honorific decrees passed by the Samian demos after their return to the island in 322 provide some information about communities that allowed the Samians to settle in their territory: Iasos (no. 891 ) ( IG xii . 6 17 . 18 ), Rhodos (no. 1000 ) ( IG xii . 6 149 ) and Ephesos (no. 844 ) ( IG xii . 6 39 )). Some may even have settled as far away as Herakleia (no. 20 ) in Sicily ( IG xii . 6 38 (C4l) with Kebric ( 1975 ), ( 1977 ) and Shipley ( 1987 ) 164 ). During the period of Athenian occupation the Athenian settlement on Samos shared many of the characteristics of a polis , although it is not referred to as polis in the personal/political sense in any contemporary source (Demades (fr. 4 ) purportedly characterised Samos as a fragment broken off from the Athenian polis ( απόρρωγα τηtildeς πόλεως )). The klerouchy is, on the other hand, described as patris in IG ii² 11169 . 5 (C4m) ( δισσαιgrave δ ' αυtilde πατρίδες σ ' ηasper µ εgraveν φυacuteσει , ηasper δεgrave νό µ οισιν ); the Dionysios of this epigram is commonly identified with ∆ιονυacuteσιος Αλφίνου Κολλυτέυς ( LSAG ii no. 414 ), who is attested as klerouch on Samos in Michel 832 . 2 . Accordingly, the two patrides mentioned in the text should be Athens ( patris by physis ) and the Athenian klerouchy on Samos ( patris by nomos ). The community of Athenians in Samos seems in many respects to have functioned independently of Athens and can in that respect be compared to a dependent polis ; cf. IG ii² 1443 . ii . 89 -91 , which records a wreath bestowed in 346 / 5 on the Athenian demos by the demos in Samos (not the Samian demos ). IG xii . 6 253 (C4m) refers to the assembly ( demos ) of Athenians in Samos, and to their boule in a probouleutic capacity. IG xii . 6 262 is a list of bouleutai and other officials in Samos ( c. 352 -347 ). The boule numbered 250 bouleutai , and on that basis it has been suggested that the number of Athenian citizens was roughly half that of Athens itself in C4 (Habicht in Hallof and Habicht ( 1995 )). The other officials mentioned in IG xii . 6 262 are the nine archontes ( xi . 1 -10 ), a grammateus ( xi . 11 -12 ), five strategoi ( xi . 13 -18 ), a grammateus demou ( xi . 19 -20 ), a grammateus boules ( xi . 21 -22 ), an official epi tois nomois ( xi . 23 -24 ), a keryx demou ( xi . 25 -26 ) and an antigrapheus ( xi . 27 -28 ). IG xii . 6 261 is an inventory of the treasurers of the Heraion of 346 / 5 . The Athenians in Samos had their own eponymous archon ( IG xii . 6 261 ( 346 / 5 )). IG xii . 6260 is part of a sacred law passed in C4m.A bouleuterion is attested in IG xii . 6257 . 3 . IG xii . 6252 has been interpreted by Hallof ( 2003 ) as a citizenship decree passed in Samos, by which the honorand is made an Athenian citizen ( 17 -19 ). It is not known if this would also give the honorand the right to enrol as a citizen in Athens proper, should he wish to settle there.That some kind of dual citizenship of the klerouchy and Athens proper was in operation is indicated by the status of the philosopher Epikouros: he was born in Samos, but was enrolled as an ephebe in Athens (Strabo 14 . 1 . 18 ; Diog. Laert. 10 . 1 ). The civic subdivisions in the klerouchy were the same as the Athenian ones, and nine of the ten Kleisthenic phylai are attested in IG xii . 6 262 . IG xii . 6 253 . 12 mentions envoys, which may indicate that the Athenians in Samos maintained their own diplomatic relations with the outside world; IG xii . 6 263 and 264 are communal dedications set up by the Athenian demos in Samos to Apollo in Delphi in c. 340 and 334 / 3 respectively, again an indication of the separate communal identity of the klerouchy. In addition to local institutions manned by klerouchs, Athenian officials were sent from Athens to Samos (Arist. Ath . Pol . 62 . 2 ), in particular a strategos ( στρατηγοgraveς ες Σά µ ον : IG ii² 1628 . 17 -18 , 28 ; 109 -10 , 119 ; I.Priene 6 . 6 ; IG xii . 6 42 . 4 -5 ; cf. Kroll and Mitchel ( 1980 ) 91 -92 ). The Athenian klerouchs were expelled in 322 / 1 , and the island given back to the Samians (Diod. 18 . 18 . 9 ; Diog. Laert. 10 . 1 ; IG xii . 6 43 . 8 -14 (C4l))."

The toponym is Σιδουacuteσση , ηasper (Thuc. 8 . 24 . 2 ) or Σίδουσα (Hecat.fr. 229 ). The city-ethnic is Σιδουacuteσιος ( IG i³ 265 . i . 61 ( 447 / 6 )). Sidousa is called a polis in the urban sense by Hecat. fr. 229 (Hansen ( 1997 ) 24 -25 ). Thuc. 8 . 24 . 2 refers to the settlement as a teichos located in the territory of Erythrai (no. 845 ), perhaps on the Mimas peninsula; although Plin. HN 5 . 137 believed that Sidousa was an island.The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute quota lists ( IG i³ 265 . i . 61 ). Sidousa was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 15 ) to 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . i . 24 ) a total of ten times, three times completely but plausibly restored.In 430 / 29 Sidousa is explictly registered as a dependency of Erythrai ( IG i³ 281 . i . 24 ). In 450 / 49 , 448 / 7 and 447 / 6 it paid alongside the other dependencies of Erythrai (no. 845 ); they all formed a syntely, but the Sidousioi paid on their own behalf ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 15 , 264 . iii . 30 , 265 . i . 61 ). In later years their payment is recorded separately from that of the other Erythraian dependencies,and they seem in all years to have paid 500 dr. ( IG i³ 271 . i . 19 ). The community was located in Erythraian territory and was undoubtedly an Erythraian dependency (Thuc. 8 . 24 . 2 : εν τηsubiotaηtilde ' ΕρυθραίΩsubiotaα ; IG i³ 281 . i . 21 : [ Σιδόσιο ] ι ' Ερυθραίον ), but the Athenians maintained control over the site during Erythrai's revolt in 412 . The designation τεῖχος in Thuc. 8 . 24 . 2 indicates that Sidousa was walled."

Smyrna is called a polis both in the urban sense (Hdt. 1 . 150 . 1 ) and in the political sense (Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 ). A possible C4f attestation of Smyrna as a polis in the political or territorial sense may be found in IG ii² 28 . 19 = Tod 114 ( 387 ), but only if the very doubtful restoration of [ τῶ µ πόλεω ] ν in ll. 17 -18 is accepted. The designation asty is applied to the urban centre of Smyrna in Pind. fr. 204 , but the context may be historical. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on a C4f coin ( infra ) and externally in Kallinos fr. 2 , West (C7 ); Pind. fr. 204 , Maehler; Hdt. 1 . 143 . 4 . For the individual and external use, see IG ii² 10369 , an Attic C4s sepulchral inscription, and Ephor. fr. 1 , referring to a contemporary Smyrnaian teacher. Smyrna was originally an Aiolic foundation from which the settlers were driven out by Ionian exiles from Kolophon (no. 848 ) (Mimnermos fr. 9 , West; Hdt. 1 . 149 . 1 -150 . 2 ). This probably happened prior to 688 (the date of the Smyrnaian Onomastos' victory in the Olympic Games), when Smyrna was considered Ionian (Paus. 5 . 1 . 7 ). Hdt. 1 . 16 . 2 refers to Smyrna as 'founded from Kolophon' , which probably relates to the Kolophonian take-over. The most likely interpretation of Hdt. 1 . 143 . 3 is that the Smyrnaians subsequently asked to participate in the Panionia, but were refused. There is no evidence for Smyrnaian participation in the Archaic or Classical periods, nor for Smyrna's interaction with other Greek states. According to Strabo 14 . 1 . 37 , Smyrna was inhabited komedon for about 400 years, dating from the Lydian conquest of the polis c. 585 (Hdt. 1 . 16 . 2 ). The physical destruction of Smyrna's urban centre may also be alluded to in Theognis fr. 1104 , West.However,archaeological evidence points to a later date for the destruction, viz . 545 , connected with the Persian conquest of Ionia (Meriç and Nollé ( 1988 ) 230 -32 ). Strabo's claim that the Smyrnaian dioikismos lasted until the refoundation of Smyrna by Alexander the Great or his successors may also have to be modified. E. Akurgal ( 1983 ) 56 -58 discusses architectural remains from C4 on the site of Archaic Smyrna. See further Mellink ( 1985 ) 563 and Gates ( 1994 ) for results of later excavations of C5 and C4structures. Bingöl ( 1976 -77 ) dated a number of roof tiles found in the harbour area to C4 , before the refoundation. On the other hand, numerous second-order settlements scattered all over Smyrnaian territory, some of them fortified, may be dated to the period after the dioikismos . Some of these are discussed by Bean ( 1955 ). The locations mentioned are Belkahve ( 6 mthick Archaic wall, ceramics from C4 and later), Adatepe (presumed by Bean to be a Heltic installation), Akçakaya (described by Weber in AM 10 ( 1885 )), also believed by Bean to be Heltic in origin, Akkaya (for which Bean ventures no date),Yamanlar road site (no date), Çobanpınarı ( terminus post quem C5 on the basis of ceramic surface finds). Meriç and Nollé ( 1988 ) 225 -26 discuss a fortified site on Çatalkaya in Smyrnaian territory. The ceramics found on the site are predominantly Archaic and Heltic. According to Hdt. 1 . 150 . 2 , the Aiolians who had been thrown out of Smyrna by the Kolophonians were received and given citizenship by the remaining eleven Aiolic poleis ; but this may very well be anachronistic. The same may be true of his allegation ( 1 . 150 . 2 ) that a treaty was made between the Kolophonians and the combined forces of the Aiolian poleis , who had aided the original Smyrnaians, according to which the Smyrnaians were allowed to take their movable property with them into their exile. As far as the public architecture of Smyrna is concerned, an open square with wells was identified and dated to C4 by E. Akurgal ( 1983 ) 56 . For a comprehensive discussion of the Athena temple, see Cook and Nicholls ( 1998 ), who regard the structure Temple III A-B (C7 ) 'as the local beginnings of wholly monumental temple architecture' (( 1998 ) 198 ). A late C7fountain house was identified and published by M.Akurgal ( 1996 ). According to him, the well seems to have been in continuous use down to the middle of C4 . Another well, dating from 630 -600 , was excavated and described by Nicholls ( 1958 -59 ) 58 -64 . E. Akurgal identified what he called the 'high street' of Old Smyrna, the so-called 'Athenastrasse' , about 4 m wide.He connected this with the 'Orientalizing settlement' (E. Akurgal ( 1983 ) 45 ). He also discussed a number of smaller streets dating to the same period (ibid. 46 ). For a summary of the discussion of the street plan of Old Smyrna, see Lang ( 1996 ) 241 -43 . E. Akurgal ( 1983 ) 14 estimated that there were c. 500 -600 houses in the urban centre of Old Smyrna in the period 630 -545 , and that the settlement housed c. 3 , 000 inhabitants. The only written attestation of the city wall of Smyrna is found in Hdt. 1 . 150 . 1 in his account of how the Kolophonians took advantage of a Smyrnaian Dionysos festival outside the walls, which the Smyrnaians were attending. The Kolophonians took possession of the urban centre and locked the gates. The archaeological evidence points to a date of the first city wall at least as early as 750 (Wall II); but the even earlier remains of Wall I were interpreted as remains of a city wall by Cook and Nicholls, who dated this to c. 850 . This date was later accepted by E. Akurgal ( 1983 ) 25 -26 , who argued that a fire in a building complex dated by him to 875 -825 affected the neighbouring city wall. For the problems surrounding the interpretation of Wall I, see Lang ( 1996 ) 241 , who prefers to interpret it as a terrace wall. Wall II appears to have been destroyed by an earthquake c. 700 and was replaced by city wall III in C7l. Akurgal argued for considerable damage having been inflicted on city wall III under Alyattes, and for the city's being unfortified in C6 (( 1983 ) 54 ). The occupation of the urban centre of Smyrna goes back at least as far as 1050 , according to E. Akurgal ( 1983 ) 15 -59 , who argues for an Aiolic phase running from 1050 to 1000 on the basis of ceramic finds (Aiolian grey ware), found together with Protogeometric and Geometric decorated sherds. In contexts of the late Geometric period, the amount of grey ware increases (ibid. 15 ). There are very few architectural remains dating from this phase, but Akurgal mentions a number of square buildings (ibid. 22 ). The next phase is the Protogeometric settlement, running from 1000 to 875 . An 'Ovalhaus'is dated to 925 -900 on the basis of ceramic finds (ibid. 17 -18 ). Early Protogeometric ceramic is interpreted as evidence for an Ionian take-over of Smyrna (ibid. 10 -21 ). The third phase,the early and middle Geometric settlement, runs from 875 to 825 (ibid. 22 -27 ). Akurgal interprets rich architectural remains from this period as part of a large housing complex (ibid. 24 -25 ). Phase four, the late Geometric settlement, runs from 750 to 675 / 650 . Architectural finds include a tholos (ibid. 28 ), a large building complex (ibid. 29 ) and a house with two rooms and an ante-room. Not much evidence, apart from ceramic finds, remains from what Akurgal designates the sub-Geometric settlement, 675 -640 (ibid. 34 ), but finds increase in the next stratum, the Orientalising settlement ( 640 -600 ), summarised ibid. 35 -50 . Architectural finds include a double megaron building,the oinochoe house,perhaps with towers. Another building complex included a bath dating from the last third of C7 (ibid. 39 -40 ). The Archaic settlement (C6 ) follows (ibid. 50 -56 ) with a number of architectural remains,along with attested repairs to older large buildings, such as the megaron house.For a summary and some critical remarks on Akurgal's reconstruction; see Lang ( 1996 ) 241 -43 . There can be little doubt, however, that the urbanisation of Smyrna was very early (C8 at the latest: Lang ( 1996 ) 242 -43 ). There was not much C5material available in 1983 (E.Akurgal ( 1983 ) 53 ); but this may have been due to incomplete excavation, rather than to absence of habitation in this period. Akurgal notes plenty of ceramic finds. There are considerable architectural remains from C4 (ibid. 56 -58 ). In the 1990 s excavations uncovered a quite dense C4settlement (see the reports in Gates ( 1994 ), ( 1996 )). The city seems to have been abandoned at the end of C4 (E.Akurgal ( 1983 ) 58 ), but Cook and Nicholls ( 1998 ) 183 note that a small settlement west of the tell seems to have had continued occupation into the Heltic period. Apart from the Dionysia mentioned by Hdt. 1 . 150 . 1 , nothing is known of Smyrnaian festivals. In addition to Onomastos mentioned above,a further Smyrnaian victor at the Olympic Games, allegedly the first of the Ionians, is mentioned in Paus. 6 . 13 . 6 ( Olympionikai 29 ). Smyrna struck electrum coins in C6f. Denominations: stater, hekte and fractions down to one-forty-eighth. Types: obv . lion's head; rev . rough incuse square (Babelon, Traité ii. 1 nos. 177 -89 ; Head, HN ² 591 ; BMC Ionia 236 ). A unique silver tetradrachm on the Rhodian standard has been dated to C4f: obv . head of Apollo, laureate; rev . lyre in slightly concave field; legend: ΣΜΥΡΝΑΙΩΝ . Head, HN ² 592 interpreted the coin as evidence for the existence of Smyrna prior to its late C4 refoundation and relocation, an assumption that now seems to be confirmed by the archaeological evidence for the C4settlement."
868,Teos (Teios),Ionia,38.05,26.45,1744,8344,"868 . Teos (Teios) Map 56 . Lat. 38 . 05 , long. 26 . 45 . Size of territory: unknown but probably 3 or 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Τέως , ηasper (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 ; Thuc. 8 . 16 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 98 ). An alternative toponym, Αθα µ αντίς , is attested in Anac. fr. 142 , Gentili. The city-ethnic is Τήιος (ML 7 b (C6e); PEP Teos 39 = SEG 2 579 . 1 (C4l); Hdt. 1 . 168 ) or Τέιιος ( IG i³ 71 . i . 127 ( 425 / 4 )). T eos is called a polis both in the urban sense (ML 30 .B. 12 -13 ( c. 470 ); Thuc. 8 . 16 . 3 ; Aen. Tact. 18 . 15 , 19 ; Ps.-Skylax 98 ) and in the political sense ( SEG 31 985 . 18 (C5f) = Nomima i 105 ; Hdt. 2 . 178 . 2 ; Aen. Tact. 18 . 13 ). The designation patris is applied to Teos in Hdt. 1 . 169 . 1 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on C4 coins ( infra ) and in inscriptions (ML 30 . 2 -3 ( c. 470 ); SEG 2 579 . 1 (C4l)) and externally in Hdt. 6 . 8 . 1 ; Thuc. 8 . 16 . 3 ; and IG i³ 71 . i . 127 . For the individual and external use, see ML 7 b (C6e); IG i³ 1372 (C5 ); Hdt. 3 . 121 ; Ar. Thesm . 161 ; Carm.Anac . 1 . 2 , West. The territory is referred to as γηtilde ηasper Τηίη in ML 30 .B 9 -10 . If Ager's ( 1991 ) interpretation of SEG 28 697 . 10 (C4l) is followed ( = Ager ( 1996 ) no. 15 ), this inscription defined the entire territories of Teos and Klazomenai (no. 847 ), starting from the border of Kolophonia in the east and moving westwards on to the isthmus of the Mimas peninsula to the territory of Erythrai (no. 845 ). For some objections, see Brixhe, BE ( 1992 ) 498 -99 . PEP Teos 135 (Classical) may be a horos demarcating Teian territory: ουasperacuteρος Τε [ ιdieresisacuteων ?] (cf. SEG 2 598 ). In C4l there were 600 wealthy Teian citizens ( euporountes ) subject to proeisphora ( Syll . ³ 344 . 116 ), and Gauthier ( 1990 ) 86 infers that the total number of citizens must have come to at least 2 , 000 -3 , 000 . According to Pherekydes ( FGrHist 3 ) fr. 102 , Teos was founded by Athamas. It was part of the Ionian dodekapolis (Hdt. 1 . 142 . 3 ) and was considered the central point of Ionia (Hdt. 1 . 170 . 3 ). When the city was conquered by the Persians c. 544 , all Teians left for Thrace and founded Abdera (no. 640 ) (Hdt. 1 . 168 ; Ps.-Skymnos 670 -71 ; SEG 47 1646 B. 1 -2 (C2 ); Strabo 14 . 1 . 30 ; see Demand ( 1990 ) 39 ), but some returned later (Strabo 14 . 1 . 30 ), and the public imprecation of 480 -450 found in the territory of Teos ( SEG 31 985 ) indicates that, to some extent, Teos and Abdera remained two parts of one polis . Teos joined the Ionian Revolt in 499 and provided seventeen ships for the battle of Lade (Hdt. 6 . 8 . 1 ). Teos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Ionian district and is recorded from 451 / 50 ( IG i³ 262 . ii . 12 ) to 430 / 29 ( IG i³ 281 . i . 50 , mostly restored) a total of thirteen times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 6 tal. It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 127 ). In 412 , she grudgingly let in the forces of Erythrai (no. 845 ) and Klazomenai (no. 847 ), at this point pro-Peloponnesian (Thuc. 8 . 16 . 3 ); but the Athenians seem to have regained control before 406 , when Teos was sacked by Kallikratidas (Diod. 13 . 76 . 4 ; cf. Xen. Hell . 1 . 5 . 15 , if the emendation of ' Ηιόνα to Τέων is accepted). After 406 Teos appears to have remained a Peloponnesian ally until induced to secede by Pharnabazos and Konon in 394 (Diod. 14 . 84 . 3 , perhaps corrupt). On the basis of SEG 31 985 . 16 -17 = Nomima I 105 it was argued by Lewis ( 1982 ) that the constitution of C5 Teos must have been a democracy. The passage requires a quorum of, presumably, 200 for any decision on penalties involving confiscation of property, imprisonment or death made by a court or assembly, a figure that Lewis regarded as relatively high. See, however, Gauthier's note of caution ( 1990 ) 85 -86 . 'The law of the polis ' is referred to in SEG 31 985 .A 19 . The instruction on synoecism with Lebedos (no. 850 ) of 303 mentions Teian laws in existence ( Syll . ³ 344 . 56 -57 ). In C4l the eponymous official was the πρυacuteτανις ( SEG 2 579 . 21 -22 = PEP Teos 39 ). In C5 the following officials are attested: aisymnetes (ML 30 .B. 3 ); a board of timouchoi (ML 30 .B. 29 ; SEG 31 985 .D. 11 ), tamias ( SEG 31 985 .D. 11 ) and a phoinikographeus ( SEG 31 985 .D. 19 -20 ). Most interpretations regard the aisymnetes as an office which had been abolished on the grounds that previous office-holders had used their position to exercise tyrannical power (Koerner ( 1993 ) 298 -99 ). A Teian strategos is attested in Aen. Tact. 18 . 16 . The phyle of the Geleontes is known from two inscriptions ( PEP Teos 121 and 132 ). Both are undated, but since the Geleontes was one of the old Ionian phylai , the presumption is that its existence in Teos goes back a long way. SEG 2 579 = PEP Teos 39 contains detailed information on taxation levied internally in Teos. Not only did a number of liturgies fall on citizens (and presumably also resident aliens); but taxes were also levied on the rearing of sheep and pigs, and on a number of other commercial activities, including wood, medicine and sale of wool and clothes. Teian grants of proxenia are attested in Syll . ³ 344 . 23 -24 ( c. 303 ), and SEG 2 579 = PEP Teos 39 (C4l) is conventionally interpreted as a grant of ateleia for a period of ten years to recently naturalised citizens of Teos. A grant of citizenship by Ephesos (no. 844 ) to a Teian is found in I.Ephesos 1437 ( 322 / 1 ); Teian theorodokoi to host theoroi from Argos (no. 347 ) are attested in SEG 23 189 . ii . 5 ( 330 -324 ). The following festivals are attested for C5 : Anthesteria, Herakleia and a festival of Zeus (ML 30 .B. 31 -35 ). As for the Teian calendar, only two months are attested for the Archaic and Classical periods: Λευκαθεών ( SEG 2 579 . 21 (C4 )) and Ποσιδηίων (Anac. fr. 362 , PMG Page), both attested in other Ionian poleis (Trümpy, Monat . 105 -6 § 90 ). The Teian acropolis was fortified, and remains of Archaic public architecture were described by Béquignon and Laumonier ( 1925 ) 284 . Tuna's recent survey revealed the foundations of a long building of massive ashlar blocks, measuring 38 . 46 × 7 . 30 m. The city walls surrounding the urban centre of Teos in C6 are mentioned in Hdt. 1 . 168 . This wall must have been pulled down, perhaps in 494 , but was rebuilt by the Athenians (Thuc. 8 . 16 . 3 ), only to be demolished once again in 411 (Thuc. 8 . 16 . 3 , 20 . 2 ). From the description in Aen. Tact. 18 . 13 -19 of the stratagem used by Temenos of Rhodos, it can be inferred that the city had substantial fortifications again in C4 , and Tuna's survey of Teos recorded remains of the Classical or early Heltic city wall which seems to have enclosed an area of c. 80 ha (McNicholl ( 1997 ) 159 -60 ; Mitchell ( 1999 ) 148 ). Ps.-Skylax 98 refers to the harbour of Teos. Teos struck electrum coins in C6f and silver coins on the Aiginetan standard in C6s-C5 and on the Phoenician standard in C4 . A few gold coins were struck in C4 . ( 1 ) Electrum, C6f: denominations: stater, twenty-fourth. Types: obv . griffin's head; rev . square punch. ( 2 ) Silver, C6 -C5 : denominations: stater, drachm, hemidrachm, trihemiobol, obol, hemiobol. Obv . griffin seated, l. forepaw raised; legend: sometimes ΤΕΙΟΝ ; rev . quadripartite incuse square. ( 3 ) Gold, C4 : obv . griffin seated; rev . circular incuse; legend: ΤΗΙ and magistrate's name. ( 4 ) Silver, C4 : denomination: drachm. Obv . griffin seated, l. forepaw raised, or head of young Dionysos; rev . quadripartite incuse square, or kantharos; legend: ΤΗΙ or ΤΗΙΩΝ and magistrate's name. A Teian silver drachm and a number of silver staters were found in the Asyut hoard, dating from 499 -494 (Price and Waggoner ( 1975 ) 85 ). Babelon, Traité ii. 2 nos. 1930 -55 , ( 1930 ) 53 -54 ; Head, HN ² 595 ; Balcer ( 1968 ); Sear ( 1979 ) 322 ; BMC Ionia 309 -13 ; SNG Cop. Ionia 1433 -43 . Teos participated in the colonisation of Naukratis (no. 1023 ) (Hdt. 2 . 178 . 2 ), and founded Phanagoria (no. 706 ) on the Black Sea in 544 and Abdera (no. 640 ) in c. 540 , a founda- tion with which Teos maintained very close ties in the Classical period (ML 30 ; SEG 31 985 ), to the extent that regulations passed at Teos were to be enforced also at Abdera."
869,Thebai (Thebaios),Ionia,37.4,27.1,539,2900,"869 . Thebai (Thebaios) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 40 , long. 27 . 10 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: B. The toponym is Θηtildeβαι , αιasper ( I.Priene 37 . 57 ; Theopomp. fr. 23 ). The city-ethnic is Θηβαῖος ( I.Priene 361 . 4 (C4m) attesting to the collective and, probably, external use). Thebai was located on Mt. Mykale. The strongest indications that Thebes was at some point a polis are the attestations of an altar of Zeus Polieus located in the sanctuary of Athena ( I.Priene 364 . 12 -14 (C3l?)) and of the collective, internal use of the city-ethnic ( I.Priene 361 . 4 (C4m), 362 . 26 (C4m)),with the clear implication in I.Priene 362 . 26 that the Thebans retained a communal identity distinct from that of the citizens of Miletos (no. 854 ), and of a clearly demarcated Theban territory. The latter had common borders with the territory of Priene (no. 861 ) ( I.Priene 363 . 24 -25 ). By C3 , however,the community had the status of a Milesian deme ( I.Priene 364 . 8 ; for grants of ateleia at deme level, see Whitehead ( 1986 ) 82 on Eleusis). According to I.Priene 37 . 57 -58 , it was given to Samos (no. 864 ) by Miletos, who had received it after the Meliac War (cf. Theopomp. fr. 23 ). However, on Hiller von Gaertringen's interpretation ( 1906 ) 185 , Miletos received Thebes from Samos in return for another site. In any case, I.Priene 363 . 22 -23 shows that Thebai was no longer part of the Samian peraia in C4m;but that does not necessarily confirm von Gaertringen's interpretation, for it is highly doubtful whether the Athenian settlers in Samos from 365 to 322 exercised any control at all over its former peraia . The designation of the boundaries of Theban territory was carried out by an individual appointed to the task by election ( I.Priene 361 . 1 -2 ), but we do not know which community was responsible for the appointment. The stephanephoros in I.Priene 364 . 1 (C3l?) was very likely Milesian rather than Theban. I.Priene 365 (C4 ) was set up by the phrourarch Ameinias, son of Themistokles. Hiller von Gaertringen assumed that he was a Milesian official (for which the archon of Teichioussa may provide a parallel, supra 1083 ), and that Thebes itself was a Milesian phrourion in C4 . The city wall of Thebes was dated on stylistic grounds to the Archaic period by Wiegand and Schrader ( 1904 ) 474 , whose excavations also uncovered two temples and a habitation area. The bronze coins found on the site were predominantly Milesian, dating from the early Heltic period. Several cult sites are attested epigraphically.In addition to the Athena sanctuary, Theban territory contained cult sites of Hermes Ktenites ( I.Priene 361 . 4 and 362 . 9 ), Mykale ( I.Priene 362 . 7 ), Nymphs ( I.Priene 362 . 7 ), Maiandros ( I.Priene 362 . 11 ) and Hekate ( I.Priene 363 . 20 -21 ).

The toponym is Αλάβανδα , τά (Hdt. 7 . 195 ) or Αλάβανδα , ηasper (Strabo 14 . 2 . 22 ). The city-ethnic is Αλαβανδευacuteς ( SEG 40 992 . 9 (C4m)) or Αλαβαδευacuteς ( I.Labraunda 37 . 3 ( c. 200 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in a treaty between Mylasa and Kindye of 354 / 3 ( SEG 40 992 . 9 ). A keryx from Alabanda is mentioned in the treaty between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) ( SEG 40 992 . 9 -10 ( 354 / 3 )); the names listed in this inscription suggest that there was a strong Karian element in the population of this community (Blümel ( 1990 ) 38 -42 ( = SEG 40 991 -92 )), and it is a moot point to what extent the Alabandeis can be considered a Hellenic polis in the Archaic and Classical periods. During the Persian War Alabanda was apparently ruled by a Karian dynast ( τυacuteραννος ), Aridolis (Hdt. 7 . 195 ). A late Classical building has been excavated 1 km south of Alabanda ( AR 45 ( 1998 -99 ) 156 ). The circuit wall of Alabanda encloses an area of 75 ha and is dated to C4 (Marchese ( 1989 ) 147 ; McNicoll ( 1997 ) 31 -38 )."

Anab . 1 . 23 . 8 ; Robert and Robert ( 1983 ) no. 15 . 11 , 13 ( 201 )). The city-ethnic is Αλινδευacuteς ( IG i³ 262 . v . 21 , restored: Αλ [ ινδ ˜ ες ]; C2 coins ( infra )). The collective use of the cityethnic is attested internally on C2 coins ( ΑΛΙΝ∆ΕΩΝ , SNG Cop. Caria 17 -18 ), and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 262 . v . 21 ). The earliest reference to Alinda as a polis is in Strabo ( 14 . 2 . 17 (r 334 )). Alinda was possibly a member of the Delian League in C5m. It is registered perhaps twice in the tribute lists, in 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . i . 3 , completely restored) and in 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 262 . v . 21 : Αλ [ ινδ ˜ ες ]), paying a phoros of 1 tal. and ? dr. It is absent from the full panel of 441 / 0 ( IG i³ 271 . i -ii . 63 -86 ). Alinda is described as a strongly fortified place ( χωρίον ) at the time of Alexander (Arr. Anab . 1 . 23 . 8 ; cf. Strabo 14 . 2 . 17 ). Possessed by the Hekatomnid Queen Ada, sister and wife of Idrieus, from 340 , Alinda was offered to Alexander by her in 334 (cf. Strabo 14 . 2 . 17 ); cf. Bean ( 1971 ) 190 -98 ). The city wall, in isodomic ashlar masonry, headers and stretchers, was perhaps built by Mausolos. The acropolis lay outside the city and was separately fortified. The acropolis wall encloses an area of 2 ha, that of the town an area of 20 + ha. There are remains of altogether nineteen rectangular towers (McNicoll ( 1997 ) 26 -31 ; PECS s.v.; cf. Bean ( 1971 ) 192 ). The site of the town is described by Robert and Robert ( 1983 ) 5 -17 ; see also Bean ( 1971 ) 192 -98 with a town plan (fig. 29 ) and the two citadels (figs. 29 , 30 ). Strabo 14 . 2 . 17 calls the town 'double' ( διττή ). Most of the buildings are postClassical. C. 150 m from the site of the town is a hill-top enclosure which could be the ruins of Queen Ada's palace (Lawrence ( 1979 ) 138 -40 )."

In the Athenian tribute lists the Amioi are once recorded under the heading h αίδε τ ˜ ον πόλεον ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 31 -33 ). The collec- tive use of the city-ethnic is used externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 33 ). The individual city-ethnic is used externally in a C3 -C2 grave inscription from Loryma ( I.Rhod.Per . 42 . 2 ). Amos was a member of the Delian League, but is registered in the tribute lists only once, in 428 / 7 , paying a phoros of 2 , 250 dr. ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 33 ). A C6 grave inscription from Amos is inscribed in the Knidian alphabet ( I.Rhod.Per. 351 ). All other inscriptions from Amos are post-Classical. The C4l fortification wall on the acropolis is in polygonal masonry ( PECS s.v.). The city wall is built in different types of masonry: pseudo-isodomic,regular polygonal and crude polygonal tending to ashlar. Pimouguet argues that it seems reasonable to conclude that the wall was built in the course of C4 and strengthened or repaired later (Pimouguet ( 1994 ) 249 -51 ). The C4 date is supported by Saner ( 1994 ), who also mentions five towers in a 400 m stretch of the wall. Only the northern and western parts of the wall are preserved,but the enclosed area must have been over 10 ha."

( IG i³ 260 . i . 15 ). In 446 / 5 they paid 4 , 500 dr. in syntely with Syangela ( IG i³ 266 . iii . 21 -22 ). Their payment was probably included in that of Syangela in the remaining years ( ATL i. 468 ); thus they are absent from the full panel of 440 / 39 ( IG i³ 271 . i -ii . 63 -86 ) but were assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 112 , almost completely restored). Bean and Cook ( 1955 ) 165 assume that the Amynandeis may have lived on the coast,either at Kargıcık or Alâkilise.At Kargıcık there are some ancient remains of an oblong perimeter constructed of great blocks,apparently with three towers and a gate to the north (ibid. 134 )."

The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in Robert and Robert ( 1983 ) no. 2 . 8 , and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 264 . ii . 4 ). In 321 / 0 the Iranian Bagadates and his son, Ariarames, were granted politeia by Amyzon, at the instigation of the satrap Asandros (Robert and Robert ( 1983 ) no. 2 , inscription and comm. 97 -118 ; cf. Hornblower ( 1982 ) 73 ). In l. 4 a prostates is mentioned,in ll. 4 -5 three archontes , in l. 5 an orophylakos , in l. 6 a tamieus , in l. 7 a synepimeletes and in l. 8 ekklesia kyria . Amyzon was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is recorded (as Μυδονηtildeς ; see Hornblower ( 1982 ) 278 ; cf. Robert and Robert ( 1983 ) 36 ) from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . vi . 6 ) to 440 / 39 ( IG i³ 272 . i . 84 ) a total of eleven times, five times completely restored, paying 1 , 500 dr. ( IG i³ 261 . i . 5 ). In a honorary decree of 321 / 0 the month name Μαρσήλλιος (a hapax ) occurs (Robert and Robert ( 1983 ) no. 2 . 2 ), which indicates the existence of a local calendar which was later replaced by an Ionian calendar, although Macedonian month names are also attested (Trümpy, Monat . 277 -78 ). At the site of Amyzon there are remains of fortification walls in ashlar masonry, probably dating to C4 (Marchese ( 1986 ) 105 ). Moreover, on two large terraced areas, enclosed by walls, are preserved the remains of a Doric temple dedicated to Apollo and Artemis with C6 terracottas.A temple of Artemis is mentioned in an inscription of 321 / 0 (Robert and Robert ( 1983 ) no. 2 ). Most of the other buildings date to C4 . One of the terraces was entered through a propylon dedicated by Idrieus in C4m ( OGIS 235 ; Marchese ( 1986 ) 107 with fig. 41 . See also Robert and Robert ( 1983 ); Hornblower ( 1982 ) 278 , 292 , 313 ."

The city-ethnic is Αρλισσευacuteς ( SEG 40 992 . 3 (C4m); I.Labraunda 67 . 16 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in a C4m treaty between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) ( SEG 40 992 . 3 ) and in a C4m name list from Labraunda ( I.Labraunda 67 . 16 ). Crampa assumed that the Arlisseis were 'in all probability a social group named after an individual Αρλισσις ' (comm. to I.Labraunda 67 . 16 ), but Blümel argues that the fact that the Arlisseis are listed in the fragmentary treaty between Mylasa and Kindye on a par with, e.g., the Kaunioi (no. 898 ) and the Koranzeis (no. 906 ) shows that the Arlisseis must have been a polis as well (Blümel ( 1990 ) 35 ( = SEG 40 992 )). Moreover, a keryx of the Arlisseis is mentioned in l. 4 . The names listed in this inscription ( 3 -4 ) suggest that there was a strong Karian element in the population of this community (Blümel ( 1990 ) 38 -42 ( = SEG 40 992 )), and it is a moot point to what extent Arlissos can be considered a Hellenic polis in the Archaic and Classical periods. Arlissos was a member of the Delian League, but it is recorded only once, in 445 / 4 ( IG i³ 267 . iii . 31 ), paying a phoros of, perhaps, 600 dr."

The Armelitai are known solely from a fragmentary C4m treaty between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) ( SEG 40 992 ), but they are listed alongside well-known poleis such as Kaunos (no. 898 ), Koranza (no. 906 ) and Latmos (no. 910 ), which suggests that the Armelitai may have been a polis too. Moreover, a keryx from the Armelitai is mentioned in l. 16 . On the other hand,the names listed in this inscription (ll. 14 -15 ) suggest that there was a strong Karian element in the population of this community (Blümel ( 1990 ) 38 -42 ( = SEG 90991 -92 )), and it is a moot point to what extent the Armelitai can be considered a Hellenic polis in the Archaic and Classical periods."

The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 68 ). Aulai was a member of the Delian League.

It is absent from the full panel of 441 / 0 ( IG i³ 271 . i -ii . 63 -86 ). There are few remains at the presumed site of Bargasa,but a fragmentary C2 decree found there does indicate that there was a polis at the site (Bean and Cook ( 1955 ) 142 , no. 67 ). There is a small citadel with remains of a ring wall in very crude masonry. A few Archaic and Heltic sherds date the settlement (ibid. 135 , 165 )."

The city-ethnic is Βαργυλιευacuteς ( IG i³ 260 . x . 10 ) or Βαργυλιήτης ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 81 ). The form Βαργυλιώτης is also attested ( Iscr. Cos ED 231 .B 4 (C2 )). The earliest attestation of polis used of Bargylia (here in the political sense) is found in an honorary decree of 270 -261 ( I.Iasos 608 . 5 et passim ; cf. 610 . 4 (C3 -C2 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 260 . x . 10 ). The individual and external use is attested in an Athenian citizenship decree of 303 / 2 ( IG ii² 496 . 23 ). Bargylia was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is registered in the tribute lists from 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . x . 10 ) to 440 / 39 ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 81 ) a total of ten times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 260 . x . 10 ), but 4 , 000 dr. in 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 41 ). Apparently Bargylia had absorbed Kindye (no. 902 ) by the early Heltic period (Hornblower ( 1982 ) 100 ; cf. Bean and Cook ( 1957 ) 96 ). The majority of the archaeological remains dates to the post-Classical period, but an extant portion of the city wall seems to go back to C4 (Bean and Cook ( 1957 ) 96 ). The wall is built in a style which comes close to ashlar masonry (Hornblower ( 1982 ) 319 ). Small parts of the north-eastern and south-western walls are preserved, and the walls must have enclosed an area of 20 + ha (Bean ( 1971 ) 86 ). The occurrence of Bargylia in the Delphian list of theorodokoi shows that it was an urban centre in C3l ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) i C. 3 )."

Chalketor is called a polis in the political sense in a fragmentary C4 decree ( I.Mylasa 911 . 8 -9 : περιgrave τηgrave µ πό [ λιν τηgraveν Χαλκ ] ητορείων ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in the C4 decree ( supra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 267 . v . 30 ). The individual and external use is attested in a C5 proxeny decree ( SEG 36 982 A. 1 ). In C5 [. . .]ssos, son of Artaos, from Chalketor was granted proxeny by Iasos (no. 891 ). Furthermore, he was granted asylia , proedria , isotelia and eisagoge/exagoge ( SEG 36 982 A). In C4 Chalketor passed a decree granting proxeny and citizenship to a man from Koranza (no. 906 ) ( I.Mylasa 911 ). In l. 3 the word ekklesia occurs (restored: [ εκκ ] λησίης [ κυρ ] ί [ ης ). A C4l-C3e lex sacra ( I.Mylasa 914 ) mentions tamiai (l. 1 ) and demos (l. 6 ). Chalketor was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is recorded from 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 262 . v . 24 ) to 440 / 39 ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 75 , completely restored) a total of ten times, four times completely restored, paying a phoros of at first 2 , 000 dr.

In the assessment decree of 410 / 9 the ethnic is almost completely restored ( IG i³ 100 . ii . 8 ).

However, on the basis of an investigation of the communities listed together with Chios in the tribute lists, Bresson ( 1990 ) concludes that the Chioi lived in the vicinity of Idyma (no. 893 ), Kedreai (no. 899 ) and the Chersonesioi (no. 882 )."

( IG i³ 71 . ii . 144 ), and once individually, assessed at 5 tal. ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 100 ). In C5f Arlissis, son of Idyssolos, from Euromos was granted proxeny by Iasos (no. 891 ). He was also granted enktesis ges kai oikion , asylia , proedria and dikai ( SEG 36 982 .B 4 ). The town was situated on flat ground. The city wall is in ashlar masonry with towers, and dates to a period no later than 300 (Bean ( 1971 ) 47 ; PECS s.v.). The other remains at Euromos (a theatre, a temple dedicated to Zeus, and two stoas) are all Heltic or later (Bean ( 1971 ) 46 -48 ). Euromos struck silver coins in C5l. Only a single specimen is known, presumably a tritartemorion. Type: obv . forepart of boar; rev . head of Zeus with laurels; legend: ΥΡΩ ( SNG von Aulock no. 2521 )."
886,Halikarnassos (Halikarnasseus),Karia,37.05,27.2,1813,9040,"886 . Halikarnassos (Halikarnasseus) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 05 , long. 27 . 20 . Size of territory: 2 ; with dependencies: 5 . Type: A: β . The toponym is Αasperλικαρνασσός , ηasper (Thuc. 8 . 42 . 4 ; Arr. Anab . 1 . 21 . 3 ), Αasperλικαρνησσός (Hdt. 7 . 99 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is Αasperλικαρνασσευacuteς ( I.Milet . vi . 2 407 (C5 ); IG ii² 142 . 9 (C4f)), Αasperλικαρνάσσιος (Androtion ( FGrHist 324 ) fr. 12 ), Αasperλικαρνησσευacuteς (Hdt. 1 . 144 . 3 ), or the epichoric ΑasperλικαρναΤε [ υacuteς ] ( Syll . ³ 45 . 2 = ML 32 ). Halikarnassos is called a polis in the political sense by Hdt. 1 . 144 . 3 and in a C4l honorary decree (Michel 452 . 4 ), and in the urban sense in an inscription of c. 400 ( SEG 43 713 . 33 , 37 , 45 ). The individual ethnic is attested externally on a gravestone from Miletos ( I.Milet . vi . 2 407 m (C5 )). The collective city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 265 . i . 10 ), and internally on coins ( SNG Cop. Caria 336 -37 ). Halikarnassos was a Dorian city, allegedly colonised by Troizen (no. 357 ) (Hdt. 7 . 99 . 3 ; cf. Paus. 2 . 30 . 9 , 32 . 6 ; Strabo 14 . 2 . 16 ). On the connections between Halikarnassos and Troizen, see Jameson ( 2004 ). Halikarnassos was one of the Greek poleis to build the Hellenion in Naukratis (no. 1023 ) (Hdt. 2 . 178 . 2 ). Halikarnassos was the capital of a dynasty which Hdt. 7 . 99 . 1 describes as a tyranny. The first tyrant was Lygdamis, succeeded by his daughter Artemisia (Hdt. 7 . 99 . 1 -2 ; Suda Η 536 ). During Xerxes' invasion of Greece she was the commander of five ships from Halikarnassos, Kos (no. 499 ), Nisyros (no. 508 ) and Kalydna (no. 485 ) (Hdt. 7 . 99 . 2 ). Later in C5f Halikarnassos was ruled by another Lygdamis. In C5m a faction joined by Herodotos was exiled after an abortive attempt to overthrow Lygdamis ( Suda Η 536 ). Halikarnassos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 13 ) to 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . iv . 15 ) a total of sixteen times, twice completely restored, paying in most years a phoros of 1 tal., 4 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 12 -13 ), but in 447 / 6 a phoros of 2 tal. ( IG i³ 265 . i . 10 ) and in 441 / 0 a phoros of 1 tal., 4 , 840 dr. ( IG i³ 271 . i . 78 ). It was assesed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 144 ). C. 370 Mausolos moved the capital of the dynasty from Mylasa (no. 913 ) to Halikarnassos and enlarged the city by synoecising some smaller settlements into it (Plin. HN 5 . 107 ; Hornblower ( 1982 ) 82 ; Demand ( 1990 ) 123 ; supra 1108 ). The city seems now to have been laid out on a Hippodamian grid plan (Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 227 ). A law of C5f mentions a ιasperερηgrave αγορή as the venue of the syllogos of the Halikarnassians and the Salmakians (no. 929 ) ( Syll . ³ 45 . 3 = ML 32 ). The law (called both αasperacuteδος ( 19 ), and νό µ ος ( 32 )) was passed by the syllogos and the tyrant Lygdamis and concerns property disputes. A number of magistrates are mentioned: prytanis ( 5 -6 ), mnemones ( 8 ) and dikastai ( 20 ). A keryx from Halikarnassos is mentioned in a C4 treaty between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) ( SEG 40 991 . 16 ). Some citizens of Halikarnassos were appointed proxenoi by the Chians (no. 840 ) ( PEP Chios 50 . 4 (C4m)). In 410 / 9 a decree was passed by the Athenians in honour of the Halikarnassian polis (restored) as euergetis of Athens ( IG i³ 103 ). In C4l Zenodotos, son of Baukis, had been honoured by Troizen (no. 357 ), and therefore more honours were bestowed upon him (Michel 452 ): he was invited to the prytaneion at Halikarnassos (l. 11 ; cf. Miller ( 1978 ) no. 323 ). This measure ( psephisma , l. 13 ) is decided by the demos (l. 12 ), after having been deliberated by the boule (l. 15 ). In 392 Phormion of Halikarnassos won a victory at Olympia ( Olympionikai 378 ). Seven month names are attested. They constitute a mixture of Ionian and non-Ionian names; see Trümpy, Monat . 113 -14 . The city wall is mentioned in a C5m inscription ( Syll . ³ 46 . 15 = ML 32 ). Under Mausolos,from 377 / 6 (Diod. 16 . 36 . 2 ), the city was enlarged by the inclusion of Salmakis (no. 929 ) and the land between the city proper and Salmakis. The city wall was replaced by a new 7 km wall which encircled the enlarged city, including the harbour; it enclosed an area of c. 220 ha (Jeppesen ( 2000 ) 334 ). The wall is built in different types of masonry, which is probably due to the building materials, rather than different construction periods. It had two main gates, one towards Myndos, the other towards Mylasa (Arr. Anab . 1 . 20 . 4 -5 ), of which only the Myndos gate has been located (Pedersen ( 1994 )). Two smaller gates have been discovered, one on the southern side of the tower on the east, the other in connection with a gate complex on the north-eastern extension. This gate undoubtedly gave access to Pedasa to the north of Halikarnassos (Pedersen ( 2000 ) 288 ). There was a moat in front of the wall (Arr. Anab . 1 . 20 . 8 ; Diod. 17 . 24 . 4 ). Thirteen towers have been found, all in different types of masonry and material, but the drain system and the general coherence indicate that the wall and towers were planned and constructed at one time,with later repairs (Pedersen ( 2000 ) 288 -91 ). On the hill commanding the road to Mylasa is a free-standing tower built in large boulders in an almost 'cyclopean' fashion. It is probably contemporary with the city wall (ibid. 291 ). In the city of Halikarnassos a temple of Apollo is attested in a C5f inscription ( Syll . ³ 45 . 45 = ML 32 ). Fragments of early Classical Ionic columns found in the city may be associated with this temple. The few architectural remains show that the temple was influenced by the Polykrates temple in Samos (Jeppesen ( 2000 ) 333 ). Furthermore,the remains of a temple in Ionic style are generally interpreted as the temple of Ares mentioned by Vitruvius ( 2 . 8 . 11 ). Ares seems to have been the principal divinity worshipped by the Halikarnassians (Hornblower ( 1982 ) 302 ). The excavated but unpublished theatre is sometimes dated to C3e, but may go further back. Diod. 15 . 90 . 3 (r 362 ) says that Halikarnassos had a famous acropolis and was 'the basileia of Karia' . At the time of Alexander, he describes it as the largest polis in Karia, endowed with several citadels ( 17 . 23 . 4 ). Diod. 17 . 25 . 5 mentions the walls of the acropolis. Alexander took and razed the city in 334 (Diod. 17 . 27 . 6 ; Arr. Anab . 1 . 20 . 2 -23 . 6 ). In C4 Halikarnassos was endowed with one of the most famous monuments of Antiquity: the tomb of Mausolos, the Mausoleum, or, more correctly, the Maussolleion , of which very little is left. In Antiquity, it ranked among the Seven Wonders of the World, and it existed until the fifteenth century, when it was destroyed by the Knights of Rhodes. Work on it was begun in 367 , and it was finished after the death of Mausolos'wife Artemisia in 351 . The architect was Pythios of Priene in collaboration with another architect named Satyros. The famous sculptors Bryaxis, Leochares, Timotheos and Skopas were involved in the work. The monument consisted of three parts: thirty-six Ionic columns stood on a very tall rectangular base, 38 . 4 × 32 m. Upon the columns was a pyramidal structure with twenty-four steps, and the monument was crowned with a sculptured group imposed on a platform. The building was adorned with numerous sculptures and friezes (Lawrence ( 1996 ) 146 -47 ; Jeppesen ( 1994 ) with refs.). So far no remains have been found of Mausolos' palace, built on the Zephyrion promontory east of the harbour and mentioned at Vitruvius 2 . 8 . 10 ; cf. Jeppesen ( 2000 ) 338 . According to Ps.-Skylax 99 Halikarnassos had an enclosed harbour and one 'by the island' . Diod. 15 . 90 . 3 (r 363 ) calls Halikarnassos εasperστία καιgrave µ ητρόπολις . In the C5m inscription which deals with purchase and sale of land and houses in Halikarnassos, a number of districts or areas are mentioned ( SEG 43 713 ). Halikarnassos struck coins before 480 , silver coins on the Rhodian standard in 400 -367 (and again in 188 -166 ). Staters are mentioned in a C5f law ( Syll . ³ 45 . 40 = ML 32 ). There are various types, and the legend is ΑΛΙΚΑΡΝΑΣΣΕΩΝ or abbreviations thereof (Head, HN ² 617 -19 ; SNG Cop. Caria 336 -37 ). Halikarnassos was a polis with a mixed population. The names listed in the C5m inscription concerning confiscation and resale of property ( SEG 43 713 ) constitute a mixture of Greek and Karian names. In some cases, a man has a Greek name, but his father a Karian ( Ζηνόδορος Αρυάσσιος , l. 10 , or ∆ιότι µ ος Σαρυσώλλο , ll. 169 -70 ), or even vice versa ( Πανυacuteασσις ∆η µ ητρίο , l. 50 ). Two of the Halikarnassians mentioned in the C4 treaty between Kindye and Mylasa have Karian names ( SEG 40 991 . 15 -16 ). There is no doubt that there was a strong Karian element in the population in the Classical period."

A toponym is not attested. The city-ethnic is h υβλισευacuteς ( IG i³ 262 . v . 26 ), Κυβλισσευacuteς ( SEG 40 991 . 8 ) or Κυλβισσευacuteς ( EA 32 95 . 16 (C2e)). In a C4m treaty between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) the Kyblisseis are among the city-ethnics listed after the heading παρηtildeσαν αποgrave πόλεων , where polis is attested in the political sense ( SEG 40991 . 8 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 262 . v . 26 ) and in the C4m treaty ( SEG 40 991 . 8 ). The Kyblisseis were members of the Delian League, but they are recorded in the tribute lists only once, in 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 262 . v . 26 ), paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. In the list of 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . i . 7 ) the city-ethnic is completely restored. They are absent from the full panel of 441 / 0 ( IG i³ 271 . i -ii . 63 -86 ), but were probably assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 108 : [h υβλι ] σσ [ ˜ ες ]) a minimum of 2 , 000 dr. A keryx from the Kyblisseis is mentioned in the C4m treaty between Mylasa and Kindye ( SEG 40 991 . 9 ). The names listed in this inscription ( 8 -9 ) suggest that there was a strong Karian element in the population of this community (Blümel ( 1990 ) 38 -42 ( = SEG 40 992 )), and it is a moot point to what extent the Kyblisseis can be considered a Hellenic polis in the Archaic and Classical periods."

The city-ethnic is ' Υδαιευacuteς ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 150 ; I.Mylasa 901 . 9 (undated)); ' Υδαευacuteς ( SEG 40 992 . 4 (C4m); I.Mylasa 903 . 5 (C2f)), and Κυδαιευacuteς ( IG i³ 262 . v . 25 , restored: [ Κ ] υδαι ˜ ες with IG i³ 264 . ii . 22 , restored: Κυ [ δαι ˜ ες ]). The Hydaieis are listed alongside well-known poleis such as Kaunos (no. 898 ) and Koranza (no. 906 ) in a C4m treaty ( SEG 40 992 . 4 ), which suggests that they may have been a polis too. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 262 . v . 25 ) and in a C4m treaty between Kindye (no. 902 ) and Mylasa (no. 913 ) ( SEG 40 992 . 4 ). The Hydaieis were members of the Delian League. They are registered in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 150 , heavily restored: Κ [ υδαι ˜ ες ]) to 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 12 , completely restored) a total of six times, once completely restored. They were assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 150 ), 2 , 000 dr.). A keryx from the Hydaieis is mentioned in a treaty of C4m ( SEG 40 992 . 5 ). The names listed in this inscription (ll. 4 -5 ) suggest that there was a strong Karian element in the population of the community (Blümel ( 1990 ) 38 -42 ( = SEG 40 991 -92 )), and it is a moot point to what extent it can be considered a Hellenic polis in the Archaic and Classical periods. The acropolis was surrounded by a wall, now decrepit (Bean ( 1971 ) 50 )."

The earliest attestation of the toponym is in a C1 inscription ( I.Stratonikeia 508 . 10 ( c. 81 )): ' Υδισός , although it was mentioned by Apollonius Aphrodisiensis, whose Καρικά may be dated to C3 ( FGrHist 740 fr. 4 ). The city-ethnic is ' Υδισσευacuteς ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 51 ; Apollonius Aphrodisiensis ( FGrHist 740 ) fr. 4 (perhaps C3 )) or ' Υδισευacuteς ( I.Mylasa 401 . 8 (C2 -C1 )). Hydisos was a member of the Delian League, but is registered only twice, in 448 / 7 ( IG i³ 264 . iii . 21 , restored: ' Υ [ δισσ ˜ ες ]) and 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 51 , restored: ' Υδι [ σσ ˜ ες ]), paying a phoros of 1 tal. At the site of Hydisos there are remains of city walls and towers, probably of early Heltic date (L. Robert ( 1935 ) 339 -40 )."
890,(Hymisseis),Karia,,,230,979,"890 . (Hymisseis) Map 61 , unlocated, but possibly situated between Amyzon (no. 874 ) and Mylasa (no. 913 ) (Pontani ( 1997 ) 7 ; cf. L. Robert ( 1955 ) 226 ). Type: C: β . A toponym is not attested. The city-ethnic is ' Υ µ ισσευacuteς ( IG i³ 262 . iv . 19 ; restored: [h υ ] µ ισσ ˜ ες ) or ' Υ µ εσσευacuteς ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 143 ; IG xii suppl. 127 . 58 (C3 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the tribute lists and in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 143 ). The Hymisseis were members of the Delian League. They are recorded three times in the lists from 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 262 . iv . 19 ) to 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 50 ), paying a phoros of 1 , 200 dr.In the assessment decree of 425 / 4 they form a syntely with the Edrieis (no. 892 ) and Kyromeis, and the three together are assessed at 6 tal. ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 143 -44 ). A Hymesseus is recordedin a C3list of proxenoi from Eresos (no. 796 ) ( IG xii suppl. 127 . 58 )."
891,Iasos (Iaseus),Karia,37.15,27.35,1692,8127,"891 . Iasos (Iaseus) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 15 , long. 27 . 35 . Size of territory: 2 or 3 . Type: A: α . The toponym is /acuteΙασος , ηasper (Thuc. 8 . 28 . 2 ; Archestratos fr. 26 . 1 , Olson and Sens) or ' Ιασός ( I.Iasos 2 . 23 ; Steph. Byz. 322 . 18 -19 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ιασευacuteς ( I.Iasos 32 . 6 (C4l); IG ii² 8931 (C4s)). Iasos is called a polis both in the urban sense ( I.Iasos 2 . 20 , 33 . 3 ; Archestratos fr. 26 . 1 , Olson and Sens) and in the political sense ( I.Iasos 1 . 3 , 30 . 3 = Tod 190 ; Diod. 13 . 104 . 7 (r 405 )). The town is described as a polisma at Thuc. 8 . 28 . 4 . Politai of Iasos are mentioned in a proxeny decree of 333 -323 ( I.Iasos 30 . 4 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in decrees ( I.Iasos 32 . 6 ) and on coins ( infra ), and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 279 . i . 69 ). The individual use is attested internally in a C2 dedication ( I.Iasos 227 . 2 ) and externally in a C4s Attic funerary inscription ( IG ii² 8931 ). The names of two districts (?) in the territory of Iasos are known from I.Iasos 1 ( Βριδας , ll. 37 and 51 , and Τυεννεσσος , ll. 31 and 34 ). On the basis of the 800 adult males mentioned by Diod. 13 . 104 . 7 in 405 , Bean and Cook ( 1957 ) 101 calculate that the urban population of Iasos must have numbered c. 3 , 000 at the time. Iasos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is registered in the tribute lists from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . v . 21 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 12 ) a total of sixteen times,five times completely restored,paying a phoros of 1 tal. from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . v . 21 ) to 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . i . 63 ), and 3 tal. from 421 / 0 ( IG i³ 285 . i . 91 ). In 412 Iasos was taken by the Spartans at the instigation of Tissaphernes (Thuc. 8 . 28 . 3 ); having pillaged the town and apparently exposed its population to an andrapodismos , the Spartans handed it over to Tissaphernes (Thuc. 8 . 28 . 4 ), who then left Iasos with a garrison (Thuc. 8 . 29 . 1 ); but the city must have joined the Athenians again, because it is called an Athenian ally in 405 by Diod. 13 . 104 . 7 . Iasos was a member of a symmachia attested exclusively by the so-called ΣΥΝ coinage (whose legend abbreviates synmachon , synmachikon or synmachia vel sim .) dating to C5l-C4e; the other poleis striking ΣΥΝ coins were Byzantion (no. 674 ), Ephesos (no. 844 ), Knidos (no. 903 ), Kyzikos (no. 747 ), Lampsakos (no. 748 ), Rhodos (no. 1000 ) and Samos (no. 864 ) (Karwiese ( 1980 ); Debord ( 1999 ) 273 -77 ). Lysander took Iasos in 405 , killed the male population of military age ( 800 men), sold women and children as slaves, and razed the city to the ground (Diod. 13 . 104 . 7 ; the MSS have Θάσον Καρίας , which Palmer has emended to /acuteΙασον τηtildeς Καρίας ; but cf. Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 15 and infra no. 899 ). In C4m Iasos belonged to the Hekatomnid Empire ( I.Iasos i ( 367 -354 )). Iasos had a boule and a demos ( I.Iasos 32 . 4 ), called ekklesia ( SEG 40 959 . 15 ( c. 330 -325 ?)) which met once every month ( I.Iasos 32 . 2 ) and the first-coming cizitens were paid for attendance ( SEG 40 959 . 4 -6 : ekklesiastikon ). The meetings were presided over by an epistates ( I.Iasos 32 . 2 -3 ), and the proposals were moved mostly by a board of prytaneis ( I.Iasos 52 . 3 ) in accordance with the probouleumatic procedure: έδοξε τηtildeι βουληtildeι καιgrave τῶι δυacute µ ωι ( I.Iasos 32 . 4 ; Rhodes, DGS 338 ). The eponymous official was a stephanophoros ( I.Iasos 32 . 1 ). Public enactments were published by the neopoiai , sometimes in the sanctuary of Apollo ( I.Iasos 42 . 8 ), sometimes in an archeion ( I.Iasos 30 . 12 ). The fact that decrees ( psephismata , I.Iasos 42 . 8 ) were passed regularly by the boule and the demos and that citizens were paid for attendance indicates that Iasos had a democratic constitution (Hornblower ( 1982 ) 111 ; Rhodes, DGS 340 ). The Aristotelian collection of politeiai included one of Iasos (Heracl. Lemb. 73 ; cf. Gigon no. 66 ). Copious information about officials is obtained from a decree of 367 -354 which deals with plots against Mausolos and the polis of Iasos ( I.Iasos 1 ). The property of the plotters is being sold, and it appears that the transactions were undertaken by four archontes ( 6 -8 ), four tamiai ( 8 -9 ), two astynomoi ( 10 ), four synegoroi ( 11 -12 ), six prytaneis ( 12 -14 ), eleven priests of Zeus Megistos ( 16 -18 ) and, finally, a number of representatives of the phylai , i.e. citizens ( 18 ff; Jones, POAG 333 ). Another decree, of c. 330 , mentions prostatai ( I.Iasos 20 . 12 ). A keryx from Iasos is mentioned in the C4m treaty between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) ( SEG 40 991 . 13 ). The citizens were subdivided into phylai and patriai ( I.Iasos 47 . 4 (C4l)). Each phyle seems to have been headed by an official called neopoies ( SEG 40 959 . 14 and 17 ) and if the six names recorded in ll. 2 -4 are those of the neopoiai (Gauthier ( 1990 ) 425 -26 ), there must have been six phylai (Jones, POAG 333 ). Both grants of proxenia and citizenship are attested in the C4 decrees ( I.Iasos 32 , 42 ; SEG 36 983 , reinscribed in C3 -C2 = SEG 38 1059 ). The three men granted proxeny by Iasos-Myrmex, Manes and Targelios, sons of Peldemis-may be identical with the three unnamed sons of Peldemos (the variations in spelling may be due to problems in transcribing) who were punished for plotting against Mausolos ( SEG 36 983 ; cf. Blümel (( 1998 b ) 171 ). Iasos is registered in the Argive list of theorodokoi of c. 330 ( SEG 23 189 . 17 ) A cult and priest of Zeus Megistos attested in a C4lex sacra ( LSAM 59 = I.Iasos 220 ), and investigations inside the temple of Zeus and Hera have revealed sherds which show that the temple was in use at least from C6 to the Heltic period (Berti ( 1987 ) 33 -34 ). A cult of Artemis Astias is attested in a C4 dedication ( I.Iasos 259 . 3 -4 ; also mentioned by Polyb. 16 . 12 . 4 ). For a sanctuary of Apollo where public enactments were set up,see I.Iasos 42 . 8 . A grave connected to the so-called heroon dates to C5 (Berti ( 1995 )). In Antiquity Iasos was situated on a small island, which is now joined to the mainland by an isthmus. Harbours are mentioned in a decree of c. 300 ( I.Iasos 3 . 6 , 14 , 25 ). The city on the island was surrounded by a wall in isodomic ashlar masonry (Hornblower ( 1982 ) 317 ). The wall is c. 2 . 4 km long (thus longer than the 1 . 8 km stated by Polyb. 16 . 12 . 2 ); it encloses an area of c. 26 ha and is built in various types of masonry;it is now dated to the period after Alexander's conquest of Asia Minor (McNicoll ( 1997 ) 109 -11 ). Dry rubble masonry on the acropolis dates from the Protogeometric or Geometric period (ibid. 111 ). On the mainland there is a massive wall the purpose of which has puzzled scholars.The date of the wall is also uncertain, but a C4l date seems plausible (Hornblower ( 1982 ) 317 with n. 184 , but McNicoll ( 1997 ) 117 suggests the time of Philip V). The extant wall has a length of c. 3 . 5 km and is built with crudely trimmed rectangular blocks. The wall has many jogs and towers (Winter ( 1971 ) 241 -43 ; Lawrence ( 1979 ) 184 -87 ). The function of the wall seems to be purely military; thus, there is general agreement that there were no buildings on the mainland (Winter ( 1971 ) 242 -43 ). Iasos struck alliance coins (silver staters) c. 394 . Type: obv . head of Apollo; rev . infant Herakles strangling serpents; legend: ΣΥΝ , interpreted as ΣΥΝΜΑΧΙΚΟΝ or ΣΥΝΜΑΧΩΝ ( HN ² 621 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) 248 ); for the ΣΥΝ coins, see Karwiese ( 1980 )). Other coins, struck for Iasos alone, have obv . Apollo; rev . incuse square with lyre; legend: ΙΑΣΕ ( SNG Cop. Caria 408 ). Two Karian graffiti incised on C5s sherds have been found at Iasos. The letters are similar to those in the Karian inscrip- tions from Killareis and Chalketor (Berti and Innocente ( 1998 )). The c. 100 names recorded in I.Iasos 1 are mostly Greek,which suggests that in C4m Iasos was a Hellenic community (Blümel ( 1990 ) 38 -42 ( = SEG 40 991 -92 ))."

The earliest attestation of Kalynda as a polis is in Polyb. 31 . 5 , who refers to events in 164 / 3 . He calls Kalynda a polis in the political sense at 31 . 5 . 3 and in the urban sense at 31 . 5 . 4 . The collective use of the cityethnic is attested externally in the tribute lists ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 70 ); the individual city-ethnic is used externally in a C2list of donations ( SEG 12 473 . 24 ). Hdt. 8 . 87 . 2 -3 explains how Artemisia, perhaps accidentally, rammed a Kalyndian ship commanded by Damasithymos, king of the Kalyndeis, although they were her allies. Kalynda was a member of the Delian League. It is recorded in the tribute lists from 444 / 3 ( IG i³ 268 . v . 8 ) to 440 / 39 ( IG i³ 272 . ii . 90 , completely restored) a total of five times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 tal. ( IG i³ 269 . iv . 8 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 131 ). Kalynda was a neighbour of Kaunos (no. 898 ), and Hdt. 1 . 172 . 2 mentions the boundary between the two communities. It was probably situated c. 10 km from the sea, where there are the remains of a ring wall in polygonal masonry. The wall is possibly early Heltic (Bean ( 1953 ) 26 n. 82 )."

The toponym is reconstructed from the city-ethnic Καρβασυανδευacuteς ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 23 ) or Καρπασυανδευacuteς ( SEG 44 890 . 27 (C2 )). However, at that time it was no longer a city-ethnic, but a sub-ethnic, Karbasyanda having become a civic subdivision of Kaunos (no. 898 ). Karbasyanda was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is registered in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 23 ) to 421 / 0 ( IG i³ 285 . ii . 13 -14 ) a total of nineteen times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. in all years ( IG i³ 260 . vi . 18 ). The Karbasyandeis were neighbours of Kaunos ( IG i³ 271 . i . 68 -69 ), and their city may have been located at a hill 1 . 6 km south-west of Kaunos. On the hill there are remains of a 65 × 20 m fort in isodomic ashlar masonry, and very scanty remains of a dry rubble wall apparently encirling the hill (Bean ( 1953 ) 15 , 21 , 24 )."

Ps.-Skylax 99 describes Karyanda as νηtildeσος καιgrave πόλις καιgrave λι µ ήν ( ουaspertildeτοι Καtildeρες ), using polis in the urban sense. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form ( ΚΑΡΥ ) on coins ( infra ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 272 . i . 76 , 263 . v . 25 ). The individual city-ethnic is used externally on a C4m gravestone from Peiraieus ( IG ii² 8963 ) and in a list of dedicators from Egypt ( CIG 4702 (C4m)). Karyanda was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is registered in the tribute lists from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . i . 31 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 7 ), a total of eleven times, paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. in the first year and 500 dr. in the following years ( IG i³ 268 . iv . 27 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 138 ). It is clear from Ps.-Skylax that in C4m Karyanda was an island with a polis and a harbour. Later, and probably in the early Heltic period, the population moved to the mainland and settled near a lake somewhere between Bargylia and Myndos (Strabo 14 . 2 . 20 ; see Bean and Cook ( 1955 ) 155 -60 ). In the island, which has tentatively been identified as the early site of Karyanda, there are considerable remains of a settlement.There is a 160 m wall,built in dry rubble,and remains of houses etc., probably dating to C4 ( PECS s.v. Salihadasi). A few bronze coins from Karyanda are known.Head dates them to C3 'or earlier' (Head, HN ² 612 ). Obv . female head; rev . forepart of a bull; legend: ΚΑΡΥ ."

In a C4m treaty between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) the Kasolabeis are among the city-ethnics listed after the heading παρηtildeσαν αποgrave πόλεων , where polis is attested in the political sense ( SEG 40 991 . 7 ). The collective use of the cityethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 32 ) and in the C4m treaty ( SEG 40 991 . 7 ). The Kasolabeis were members of the Delian League.They are listed from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 27 ) to 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 44 ) a total of seven times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 2 , 500 dr. They are absent from the full panel of 441 / 0 ( IG i³ 271 . i -ii . 63 -86 ) but were possibly assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 172 : [ Κασολα ] βε [ ς ]). A keryx from the Kasolabeis is mentioned in the C4m treaty between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) ( SEG 40 991 . 7 -8 ). The names listed in this inscription ( 7 -9 ) suggest that there was a strong Karian element in the population of Kasolaba (Blümel ( 1990 ) 38 -42 ( = SEG 40 991 -92 )), and it is a moot point to what extent Kasolaba can be considered a Hellenic polis in the Archaic and Classical periods."
898,Kaunos (Kaunios),Karia,36.5,28.35,1026,4923,"898 . Kaunos (Kaunios) Map 65 . Lat. 36 . 50 , long. 28 . 35 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: γ . The toponym is Καυtildeνος , ηasper (Hdt. 5 . 103 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 99 ; IG i³ 271 . i . 69 ). The city-ethnic is Καυacuteνιος ( IG i³ 260 . vii . 8 ). Kaunos is called a polis in the urban sense ( Hell . Oxy . 23 . 3 ; Ps.-Skylax 99 ) and in a C4m treaty between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) the Kaunians are listed after the heading παρηtildeσαν αποgrave πόλεων , where polis is attested in the political sense ( SEG 40 991 . 18 ( 354 / 3 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 279 . i . 9 ) and in a treaty of 354 / 3 ( SEG 40 992 . 5 (C4m)), and internally in the abbreviated form ΚΑ on C4 coins (Konuk ( 1998 ) 219 ). The individual and external use is attested in a decree from Iasos ( I.Iasos 45 . 5 (C4 -C3 )). Kaunos was taken by Harpagos in C6 (Hdt. 1 . 176 . 3 ). Around 497 it participated in the Ionian Revolt (Hdt. 5 . 103 . 2 ). Kaunos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is registered in the tribute lists from 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . vii . 8 ) to 421 / 0 ( IG i³ 285 . ii . 11 ) a total of fourteen times, three times completely restored, paying a phoros of 3 , 000 dr. in all years. It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 98 ) of 10 tal. Kaunos revolted, either c. 440 , or in the early 420 s (Ktesias ( FGrHist 688 ) fr. 14 . 45 ; cf. Hornblower ( 1982 ) 28 n. 176 ). The tribute lists show that Kaunos was back in the League by 421 / 0 , but it seceded from Athens once again in 412 / 11 (Thuc. 8 . 39 . 3 -4 , 41 . 1 , 42 . 2 , 57 . 1 ). In 397 / 6 Konon had his headquarters at Kaunos ( Hell . Oxy . 23 ) and was besieged by a Spartan squadron under Pharax (Diod. 14 . 79 . 5 ). Kaunos was taken by the Macedonians in 333 (Arr. Anab . 2 . 5 . 7 ). In C4l-C3e a citizen of Kaunos was granted proxenia by Iasos (no. 891 ) ( I.Iasos 45 ). Kaunos had a harbour (Ps.-Skylax 99 : λι µ ηgraveν κλειστός ), and Diod. 20 . 27 . 2 refers to two citadels in 309 , one with a Herakleion, the other with a Persikon. Diod. 14 . 79 . 4 mentions a phrourion , Sassanda, 150 stadia from Kaunos. The early city was located on a small acropolis overlooking the harbour (Gates ( 1994 ) 266 ). Investigations of the fortifications seem to show that a major expansion took place in the Hekatomnid period (ibid.). Remains of city walls in various styles of masonry date from the Heltic period,although some parts of the wall may be dated to C4 . The walls enclose an area of c. 190 ha (Bean ( 1953 ); Hornblower ( 1982 ) 315 -16 ; McNicoll ( 1997 ) 192 -99 ). Diod. 14 . 79 . 4 mentions that Kaunos was besieged by the Spartan nauarchos Pharax in 396 , so the city must have been walled by then. The earliest finds at Kaunos go back to c. 700 (Gates ( 1994 ) 266 ). According to some numismatic publications, Kaunos struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard in C6 , and bronze coins from C4m (Head, HN ² 612 -13 ; SNG Cop.Caria 179 -83 ); but recently a group of C5silver coins have been attributed to Kaunos (Troxell ( 1979 ); Meier-Brügge ( 1998 ); Konuk ( 1998 )). Some of the coins belonging to this group bear a legend in Karian script, and thanks to the decipherment of the recently found bilingual inscription from Kaunos (Frei and Marek ( 1997 )), it is now evident that the legend is the name of Kaunos in Karian. Incidentally, the name of Kaunos in Karian is χ bid-, and the ethnic is χ bidêñni (ibid. 23 ). Thus the name 'Kaunos' is not a transcription, but a Greek name. The types of the Archaic coins are obv . forepart of a lion; rev . incuse square divided into two oblong halves. The C5 coins have been found in the following denominations: staters, drachms, hemidrachms, tritartemoria, trihemitartemoria. Obv . winged Iris. rev . rectangular or triangular shape in an incuse square or griffin, sometimes a legend in Karian script (for the details of these coins, see Konuk ( 1998 )). The types of the C4 coins are obv . forepart of a bull; rev . Sphinx along with the legend ΚΑ . These are the first Kaunian coins with Greek legends (see also Konuk ( 1998 ) 219 ). According to Hdt. 1 . 172 . 1 , the Kaunians were indigenous Karian-speaking people who, however, believed that they had come from Crete. In Ps.-Skylax 99 Kaunos is still classified as a Karian polis . Furthermore, kerykes from Kaunos are mentioned in the treaty between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) ( SEG 40 991 . 18 -19 ); the names listed in this inscription as well as the bilingual inscription ( supra ) suggest that there was still a strong Karian element in the population of this community (Blümel ( 1990 ) 38 -42 ( = SEG 40 991 -92 )). Only coins of C4 have legends in Greek, and it is a moot point to what extent Kaunos can be considered a Hellenic polis in the Archaic and Classical periods."

The toponym is Κεδρεαί , αιasper (Hecat. fr. 248 ; I.Rhod.Per. 553 . 9 (C2e)) or Κεδρειαί (Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 15 ). The city-ethnic is Κεδριάτης ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 76 ), Κεδριήτης ( IG i³ 259 . v . 17 ), Κεδρεάτας ( I.Rhod.Per. 561 (perhaps C4 )), feminine Κεδρεαtildeτις ( I.Rhod.Per. 612 (C3 -C2 )). Kedreai is called a polis mainly in the urban, but probably also in the political sense by Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 15 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 76 ). The individual city- ethnic is used internally in a grave inscription ( I.Rhod.Per. 561 (perhaps C4 )), and externally in a C3 -C2 grave inscription from Idyma ( I.Rhod.Per. 612 , feminine). Kedreai was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is registered in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . v . 17 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 20 ) a total of sixteen times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 3 , 000 dr. ( IG i³ 261 . i . 12 ) down to probably 440 / 39 ( IG i³ 272 . i . 80 , amount restored), but 2 , 000 dr. in 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . i . 69 ). It was still an Athenian ally in 405 (Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 15 ). Kedreai suffered andrapodismos in 405 after an attack by Lysander in 405 (Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 15 ). Remains of an early Heltic city wall at Kedreai have been found, generally in polygonal masonry (Bean ( 1971 ) 54 -55 ; cf. Anabolu ( 1994 )), although some parts are in rectangular isodomic masonry (Pimouguet ( 1994 ) 253 -54 ). Furthermore,there are scanty remains of a temple,probably Archaic (Bean ( 1971 ) 55 ). Xenophon states that Kedreai was a mixed settlement, µ ιξοβάρβαροι , in 405 (Xen. Hell . 2 . 1 . 15 )."

The toponym is Κέρα µ ος , ηasper (Strabo 14 . 2 . 15 ). The city-ethnic is Κερα µ ευacuteς ( IG i³ 265 . i . 8 ) or Κερά µ ιος ( IG i³ 267 . v . 25 ; SEG 40 992 . 13 (C4m)). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a proxeny decree of C4l ( I.Keramos 3 . 5 ) and externally in a treaty of 354 / 3 ( SEG 40 992 . 13 ). Keramos was a member of the Delian League.It belonged to the Karian district and is registered in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . v . 18 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 .i. 25 ) a total of twelve times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 tal., 3 , 000 dr. in all years ( IG i³ 261 . i . 4 ). A keryx from Keramos is mentioned in the treaty of 354 / 3 between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) ( SEG 40 992 . 13 ). In C4l Keramos granted proxenia , politeia and enktesis ges kai oikias to a certain [ c. 7 ] ον Μάρωνος ( I.Keramos 3 ). Moreover, he was granted the right to participate in sacrifices ( 9 -11 ). A phyle , Τεβρε µ ουν , is mentioned in ll. 11 -12 . The remains at Keramos have been described by Spanu ( 1997 ). Most of the buildings are post-Classical, but the city wall may be as early as C4m (Lawrence ( 1979 ) 258 ). Spanu, and Bean and Cook suggest a C4l-C3e date for the wall (Spanu ( 1997 ) 82 n. 27 ; Bean and Cook ( 1957 ) 66 ), and McNicoll a C2 date between 168 and 133 (McNicoll ( 1997 ) 170 ). The acropolis walls are in Lesbian and polygonal masonry (ibid. 161 ). The city walls are built in two different styles, undoubtedly contemporary: polygonal and pseudoisodomic ashlar masonry (Spanu ( 1997 ) 61 -91 ; Dornisch ( 1992 ) 145 ). Spanu reports that there are eight towers, seven gates and eight sally-ports (Spanu ( 1997 ) 61 -91 ), whereas McNicoll states that although only thirteen towers-all rectangular-are visible today,the number of towers must have totalled at least eighteen. There were possibly three main gates and thirteen tower entrances and sally-ports (McNicoll ( 1997 ) 160 -64 ); see also Dornisch ( 1992 ) 144 -51 ). There were four grave areas around the city, and some of the graves date to C4s (Spanu ( 1997 ) 164 -72 ). Keramos is generally considered Karian in origin ( PECS s.v.; Spanu ( 1997 ) 15 ). The name of the phyle Τεβρε µ ουν is clearly Karian ( I.Keramos 3 . 12 ). An Archaic kouros has been found at Keramos (Richter ( 1960 ) 111 no. 130 ), as well as the torso of another (Gürmann ( 1977 )), and while this shows both that Keramos existed as early as C6 and that there was some contact to the Greek world by C6 , it does not of course show that Keramos was in any way Heled.The names of the Keramioi listed in the C4m treaty between Mylasa and Kindye ( SEG 40 992 ) suggest that there was a strong Karian element in the Keramian population, and it is a moot point to what extent the community can be considered a Hellenic polis even in the Classical period. Until recently it was believed that Keramos struck coins only from C2 ; but recently an isolated C4 issue of bronze coins has come to light. The coins bear the legend ΚΕ , and it has been suggested that they be attributed to Keramos, although nearby Kedreai (no. 899 ) is another possibility. Obv . bull standing to the right; rev . swimming dolphin and the legend ΚΕ (Ashton et al. ( 1998 ))."

The Killareis were members of the Delian League, but they are recorded in the tribute lists only once, in 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 262 . v . 28 ), paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr. In the list of 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . i . 8 ) the city-ethnic is completely restored. Moreover, they may have been listed in the tribute assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 96 -97 ), where we find [ Κι ] λλ [ αρ ˜ ες h ˜ ο ] ν Σα [---άρχει ], which indicates that the Killareis were ruled by a dynast (Bean and Cook ( 1957 ) 99 -100 ). The Killareis were assessed at 2 tal. Around C4m the Killareis passed a decree, granting honours to Hyssollos, son of Samoos ( I.Mylasa 961 = L. Robert ( 1950 ) 14 no. 11 ). In l. 1 the word ekklesia occurs.A keryx from the Killareis is mentioned in the C4m treaty between Mylasa and Kindye ( SEG 40 991 . 12 ). The remains of the site of the Killareis consist of C4fortifications. There is an outer circuit in squared masonry with towers,and a citadel linked to the outer circuit on the northern side. Inside the citadel there are underground galleries which have been interpreted as cisterns (Bean and Cook ( 1957 ) 99 ). A C3m inscription mentions a harbour (although the site of the Killareis was located c. 10 km inland (Blümel ( 1992 ) 128 D 4 and comm. ad. loc. ; cf. SEG 42 994 .D 4 ). The stone which carries the C4 decree of the Killareis (see supra ) is inscribed in Karian as well (Deroy ( 1955 ) 314 ), which indicates that there was a Karian element in the area at the time. The Karian text contains the city-ethnic, but not the personal names of the Greek text, so the inscription is not a bilingual one (Blümel ( 1992 ) 128 ; Blümel and Adiego ( 1993 )). Similarly, the names listed in the treaty between Mylasa and Kindye suggest that there was a strong Karian element in the Killarian population ( SEG 40 991 . 11 -12 ; see Blümel ( 1990 ) 38 -42 ( = SEG 40 991 -92 )), and it is a moot point to what extent the community can be considered a Hellenic polis in the Archaic and Classical periods."
902,Kindye (Kindyeus),Karia,37.1,27.4,614,2795,"902 . Kindye (Kindyeus) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 10 , long. 27 . 40 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: B: β . The toponym is Κινδυacuteη , ηasper (Strabo 14 . 2 . 20 ) or Κυνδυacuteη ( IG i³ 263 . v . 23 ). The city-ethnic is Κινδυευacuteς ( IG i³ 272 . i . 69 ; SEG 40 991 . 6 (C4m); Hdt. 5 . 118 . 2 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic may be attested internally in abbreviated form on a coin ( infra ) and is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 272 . i . 69 ) and in a C4m treaty ( SEG 40991 . 6 ). For the individual and external use, see Hdt. 5 . 118 . 2 . Kindye was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is registered in the tribute lists from 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . x . 9 ) to 440 / 39 ( IG i³ 272 . i . 69 ) a total of six times, once completely restored. It is recorded once by toponym ( IG i³ 263 . v . 23 ), and otherwise by city-ethnic, paying a phoros of 1 tal. ( IG i³ 272 . i . 69 ). It is absent from the full panel of 441 / 0 ( IG i³ 271 . i -ii . 63 -86 ) but is registered in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 155 -56 ). It is restored Κιν [ δυ ˜ ες h ˜ ον ] άρ [ χει -- which indicates that Kindye was ruled by a dynast at the time. Hdt. 5 . 118 . 2 mentions another dynast, a certain Pixodaros, son of Maussolos, probably an ancestor of the Hekatomnids (Hornblower ( 1982 ) 26 ). A treaty of 354 / 3 between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye concerns the purchase of a land plot ( SEG 40 991 ). Mylasa buys a piece of land from Kindye, and the borders are described.A kome is mentioned in l. 4 . At the site of Kindye there are remains of city walls (approximately 450 × 200 m) of the Classical period, with a citadel ( c. 120 m) built in dry rubble masonry,in places tending to polygonal. There are few remains of the temple of Artemis Kindyas, mentioned by Strabo at 14 . 2 . 20 and known from a c. 200 lex sacra ( EA 32 91 ) from Bargylia (no. 879 ) (cf. also Polyb. 16 . 12 . 3 ) (Bean and Cook ( 1957 ) 97 -99 ). Apparently Bargylia (no. 879 ) had absorbed Kindye by the early Heltic period (Hornblower ( 1982 ) 100 ; cf. Bean and Cook ( 1957 ) 96 ). Some coins mentioned by Bean and Cook ( 1957 ) 95 and thought to be coins of Pikres (of Syangela) have now been attributed to Kindye, because a later-published coin bears the legend ΚΙ . The coins are of the late Archaic period.Type: Obv . head of griffin; rev . diamond-shaped lattice frame encasing four-pointed star. One coin has the legend ΚΙ (Kagan and Kritt ( 1995 )). A fragmentary C4l (or possibly C3e) funerary distichon from Kindye carries some Karian letters as well, which suggests that there was still a Karian element at Kindye in the early Heltic period (L. Robert ( 1950 ) 10 no. 6 = Deroy ( 1955 ) no. 6 ; cf. Hornblower ( 1982 ) 342 )."
903,Knidos (Knidios),Karia,36.45,27.4,2327,11450,"903 . Knidos (Knidios) Map 61 . Lat. 36 . 45 , long. 27 . 40 until C4f; from C4m lat. 36 . 40 , long. 27 . 20 (Berges ( 2000 ); see infra ). Size of territory: 4 or 5 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Κνίδος , ηasper ( Hymn. Hom. Ap . 43 ; Hdt. 2 . 178 . 2 ; Thuc. 8 . 35 . 3 ; I.Knidos 5 . 6 (C4f)). The city-ethnic is Κνίδιος ( I.Knidos 501 . 2 (C6l); IG i³ 261 . iv . 8 ). Knidos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Thuc. 8 . 35 . 3 ; Ps.-Skylax 99 : polis Hel ) and in the political sense ( I.Knidos 5 . 4 , 603 . 12 ; SEG 44 901 (C4f); Hdt. 1 . 144 . 3 , 2 . 178 . 2 ). The word politai occurs in a C6l epigram ( I.Knidos 501 . 1 ). Knidos is called patris on a C4 grave inscription ( I.Knidos 625 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in C4 proxeny decrees ( I.Knidos 1 . 7 , 5 . 1 , 603 . 6 ) and on coins ( infra ), and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 8 ) and in literary sources (Thuc. 3 . 88 . 2 ). For the individual and external use, see C4 -C3 gravestones from Attika ( IG ii² 9039 -43 ) and the Eleusinian accounts of 329 / 8 ( IG ii² 1672 . 191 ). The site of the city of Knidos has been a matter of great dispute.Bean and Cook have argued that the political centre of Knidos was at one point moved from a site on the south coast of the Knidian peninsula to the tip of the peninsula ( 1952 ). No ancient source mentions such a move, and the argument was based solely on the fact that no archaeological remains at Tekir seem to antedate C4 . The suggestion was followed notably by Robert and Robert ( BE ( 1954 ) 168 ) and Hornblower (( 1982 ) 101 ), and recently by Bresson ( 1999 ) and Berges (( 1994 ), ( 2000 )). Since the publication of Bean and Cook's article, excavations at Tekir have revealed remains that do go further back than C4 and that, along with the fact that no ancient source mentions a relocation have led others to argue that Knidos was located at Tekir from the outset (Love ( 1972 ); Demand ( 1989 ); Blümel ( 1991 ) 131 -32 ). The latest suggestion, that of Bresson, is that that while there can be no doubt that there were two urban centres on the peninsula, the political centre was at Burgaz until C4l, when it was moved to Tekir. The name of the territory of Knidos was Κνιδίη (Hdt. 1 . 174 . 2 ; Thuc. 8 . 35 . 2 ). The find of a C6 inscription in the Knidian alphabet ( = I.Rhod.Per. 351 ) on the Loryma peninsula, supports, according to Blümel, Cook's suggestion that the Loryma peninsula was part of Knidian territory at the time, or at least an 'Einflussgebiet' (Cook ( 1961 a ) 60 ; Blümel ( 1991 ); pace Held ( 1996 ) 166 -67 , who argues that it was independent of Knidos and Rhodos (no. 1000 ) before C4 ). Ps.-Skylax 99 indicates that in C4s some of the hinterland of Knidos was dominated by Rhodos. According to Hdt. 1 . 174 . 2 , the Knidians were colonists from Lakedaimon (no. 345 ) (cf. Malkin ( 1994 ) 81 ; Cartledge ( 2002 ) 93 -94 ), whereas Strabo 14 . 2 . 6 says that they came from Megara (no. 225 ). Knidos was one of the original members of the Dorian hexapolis , and the common Dorian sanctuary at Triopion was probably situated on Knidian territory ( infra ). In C6e Knidos was one of the Dorian poleis behind the Hellenion at Naukratis (no. 1023 ) (Hdt. 2 . 178 . 2 ). Knidos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 8 ) to 427 / 6 or 426 / 5 ( IG i³ 284 . 13 ) a total of thirteen times, four times completely restored, paying a phoros of 3 tal. in 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 8 ), 5 tal. from 450 / 49 IG i³ 263 . i . 4 ), again 3 tal. from 444 / 3 ( IG i³ 268 . iv . 19 ), and 2 tal. from 428 / 7 ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 20 ). It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 134 ). In 412 Knidos revolted against Athens at the instigation of Tissaphernes (Thuc. 8 . 35 ; cf. Debord ( 1999 ) 219 with n. 127 ), and at Delphi the statues of those who fought with Lysander at Aigos potamoi in 405 included one of Theodamos of Knidos (Paus. 10 . 9 . 9 ). Knidos was a member of a symmachia attested exclusively by the so-called ΣΥΝ coinage (whose legend abbreviates synmachon , synmachikon or synmachia vel sim .) dating to C5l-C4e; the other poleis striking ΣΥΝ coins were Byzantion (no. 674 ), Ephesos (no. 844 ), Iasos (no. 891 ), Kyzikos (no. 747 ), Lampsakos (no. 748 ), Rhodos (no. 1000 ) and Samos (no. 864 ) (Karwiese ( 1980 ); Debord ( 1999 ) 273 -77 ). Aristotle twice refers to the Knidian constitution: at Pol . 1305 b 12 he states that the oligarchy at Knidos was overthrown by the demos , because hoi gnorimoi were split into two factions; at Pol . 1306 b 5 he refers once again to the citizens overthrowing a despotic oligarchy at Knidos. Some have taken these passages to refer to two different revolutions, the first Archaic, the second perhaps C4 (Hornblower ( 1982 ) 117 ). A preferable view seems to be that they both refer to the same revolution (Gehrke, Stasis 79 ; Robinson ( 1997 ) 101 -3 ) which, however, cannot be dated. Oligarchic Knidos was ruled by a council of sixty amnemones appointed for life from among the aristoi and acting as probouloi (Plut. Mor . 292 A-B). The attestation of probouloi seems to match the observation by Rhodes, DGS 330 : that any mention of a boule involved in the decisionmaking process is of the Roman period. The preserved C4 decrees are proposed by a board of prostatai and carried by 'the Knidians': έδοξε Κνιδ [ ίοι ] ς γνώ µ α προ [ στα ] ταtildeν ( I.Knidos 603 . 1 -3 (C4f)). Of two C4 Knidian dedications in Delphi, the older has Κνίδιοι ( Syll . ³ 140 (shortly after 386 )), the other Κνιδίων οasper δηtilde µ ος ( Syll . ³ 290 ( c. 332 )). Hornblower ( 1982 ) 116 infers that an oligarchy of C4f was replaced by a democracy in the age of Alexander. From c. 300 the coins of Knidos have on the obv. the head of Demokratia with the legend ∆ΗΜΟΚΡΑΤΙΑ (Head, HN ² 616 ; SNG Cop.Caria 305 ). A tradition going back to Hermippos (fr. 16 , Wehrli) reports that Eudoxos of Knidos ( c. 408 -355 ) legislated for his home town of Knidos (Diog. Laert. 8 . 88 ; Plut. Mor . 1126 B). Combining these sources, Hornblower ( 1982 ) 117 -18 suggests that the C4f oligarchy was introduced by Eudoxos in concert with Mausolos, but was replaced by a democracy in consequence of Alexander's conquest of Asia Minor. Some prostatai of Knidos are mentioned in a C4s lex sacra ( I.Knidos 160 . 2 ) and in a C4f proxeny decree ( I.Knidos 603 . 2 -3 ; cf. I.Knidos 604 . 1 ). A citizen of Knidos was awarded proxenia by the Karthaians (no. 492 ) ( IG xii . 5 542 . 26 (C4m)). Envoys from Knidos are mentioned by Diod. 20 . 95 . 4 (r 304 ). In C4f the Knidioi granted Dionysios of Miletos (no. 854 ) proxeny ( I.Knidos 1 ), about the same time proxeny was granted to Amphares of Athens (no. 361 ) ( I.Knidos 5 ), and c. 363 the Knidioi granted Epameinondas of Thebes (no. 221 ) proxeny (Blümel ( 1994 ) 157 -58 ; on the significance of this decree, see Buckler ( 1998 ), ( 2000 ) 439 ). A number of cults are attested at Knidos. According to Paus. 1 . 1 . 3 (r 394 and earlier) the Knidioi worshipped Aphrodite, and they had three temples dedicated to her, one for Aphrodite Doritis (the oldest),one for Aphrodite Akraia, and one for the Aphrodite called Knidia by most Greeks,and Euploia by the Knidioi. There was a cult of Demeter and Kore at Knidos, as attested in a dedicatory epigram of C4l ( I.Knidos 131 ; cf. I.Knidos 132 ), and cult of the Dioskouroi is attested in a C6f dedication ( I.Knidos 601 ). Games in honour of Apollon Triopios were held there (Hdt. 1 . 144 ). The Knidian peninsula was also the site of the sanctuary of the Dorian hexapolis at Triopion with a temple of Apollo (Thuc. 8 . 35 . 2 ; Diod. 5 . 61 . 2 ). The exact site of Triopion has also been the subject of debate: most scholars assume that it was located at Tekir, whereas Berges argues that the sanctuary of Triopion was situated at an extensive ( c. 100 × 80 m) terraced site c. 15 km east of Burgaz. The site has not been thoroughly excavated (yet), but the remains of walls and ( inter alia ) a graffito with a hieros gamos scene clearly point to an Archaic (C7l-C6e) foundation date.There are remains of a small temple of the Heltic period, and some very large Doric drums which might be the remains of a temple of considerable dimensions (Berges ( 1995 -96 ) esp. 114 -19 ; cf. Berges and Tuna ( 1990 )). While it seems certain that the place was a sanctuary, it is too early to tell whether it was the Triopion. At modern Tekir there are remains of a stoa, built in two phases,of which the earliest is C4s in isodomic masonry (for this stoa, see Love ( 1972 ) 63 -64 ). The Propylon which leads to the sanctuary of Apollo may date to c. 300 (Bankel ( 1997 ) 68 ). A temple of Dionysos mentioned in a lex sacra of C4s ( I.Knidos 160 = LSAM 55 ). At modern Tekir there are remains of acropolis walls, the earliest parts of which date from C4m and are built in pseudo-isodomic and isodomic ashlar masonry ( AR ( 1999 )); they enclose an area of 20 ha (Bean ( 1971 ) 149 ). It is assumed that the habitation area was located on the small island which is now connected with the peninsula by a narrow isthmus, while the public buildings were located on the peninsula. No remains of the habitation area-assumed to have had a Hippodamian layout-have been found, whereas there are rich finds from the peninsula site. The majority of the remains, such as the theatre and the bouleuterion , are late. According to Thuc. 8 . 35 . 3 , Knidos did not have city walls in 412 . At modern Burgaz there are remains of C5l fortification walls built in ashlar masonry ( AR ( 1999 ); Gates ( 1995 ) 236 , ( 1997 ) 282 ). Berges argues that these walls surrounded the acropolis (Berges ( 1995 -96 )). At modern Burgaz there are traces of buildings and paved streets dating to the Archaic and Classical periods ( AR ( 1999 ); Gates ( 1995 ) 236 , ( 1997 ) 282 ). Sherds show that the site goes back to C8 . The harbour has been located, and the moles date to C4 . A C4 boundary stone (provenance: built into the mosque in Karaköy, not far from Burgaz) marked the harbour ( I.Knidos 613 ; the inscription reads: /asperacuteΟρος λι µ ένος ). The Knidioi put up a treasury (Bommelaer ( 1991 ) pl. V no. 219 ) and several communal dedications at Delphi. The earliest dates to C6m ( I.Knidos 211 ), and two more were put up in C4 ( I.Knidos 212 (C4e), 213 (C4l); cf. Jacquemin ( 1999 ) nos. 113 -18 ). Knidian C6m dedicatory graffiti are also found in the temple of Apollon Milasios at Naukratis ( I.Knidos 214 -15 ), and in the temple of Athena at Lindos ( I.Knidos 217 ). Knidos struck silver coins on,first,the Milesian and,then, the Aiginetan standard from the late Archaic period. Denominations: drachm, diobol, obol. Type: obv . forepart of lion; rev . incuse square with the head of Aphrodite; legend: sometimes ΚΝΙ or ΚΝΙ∆ΙΟΝ , after 411 ΚΝΙ∆ΙΩΝ . After 387 also didrachm and hemidrachm, and the obv . and rev . types are reversed, with a magistrate's name sometimes added on the rev . ( HN ² 614 -16 ; Cahn ( 1970 ); SNG Cop.Caria 199 -331 ). In addition, Knidos was among the poleis which in C5l-C4e struck the so-called ΣΥΝ coins (for which see Karwiese ( 1980 )). The Knidioi founded a colony at Lipara (no. 34 ) (Thuc. 3 . 88 . 2 ; Paus. 10 . 11 . 3 ), along with the Rhodians (Diod. 5 . 9 ), c. 580 -576 ."

The toponym is Κολιοργα ( I.Stratonikeia 289 . 6 (Roman)) or Κολιεργα ( I.Stratonikeia 293 . 31 (Roman)). The ethnic is Κολιυργευacuteς ( SEG 40 992 . 18 (C4m)); the collective and external use is attested in a C4m treaty ( SEG 40 992 . 18 ). The Koliyrgeis are mentioned in a fragmentary C4m treaty between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) ( SEG 40992 ), and they are listed alongside well-known poleis such as Kaunos (no. 898 ), Koranza (no. 906 ) and Latmos (no. 910 ), which suggests that the Koliyrgeis may have been a polis too. The names listed in this inscription (ll. 17 -18 ) suggest that there was a strong Karian element in the population of this community (Blümel ( 1990 ) 38 -42 ( = SEG 40 991 -92 )), and it is a moot point to what extent the Koliyrgeis can be considered a Hellenic polis in the Archaic and Classical periods."
906,Koranza (Koarendeus),Karia,,,567,2945,"906 . Koranza (Koarendeus) Map 61 , unlocated. Type: A: γ . The toponym is Κώρανζα , τά ( I.Labraunda iii . 2 42 . 2 (C3e)). The city-ethnic is Κοαρενζευacuteς ( SEG 40 992 . 7 (C4m)), Κοαρρενδευacuteς ( I.Mylasa 8 . 9 (C4 )), Κωρανζευacuteς ( I.Stratonikeia 502 . 2 (C4m)) or Κοαρανζευacuteς ( I.Stratonikeia 503 . 9 ( 318 )); cf. Blümel ( 1998 a ) 170 . In later inscriptions (Heltic, Roman) only a form without ν - (i.e. ραζ -) is found; see S  ahin ( 1973 ) 189 (cf. Blümel ( 1998 a ) 170 ), who presumes that the original name was Κοάρρενδα with the typically Karian ending νδα . Koranza is called a polis in the political sense in an honorary decree from Lagina of 318 ( I.Stratonikeia 503 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in a treaty of 354 / 53 ( SEG 40 992 . 7 ), and internally in dedicatory inscription of c. 350 ( I.Stratonikeia 502 ). The individual city-ethnic is used externally in a proxeny decree from Chalketor ( I.Mylasa 911 (C4 )). In a dedicatory inscription of c. 350 ( I.Stratonikeia 502 . 10 -16 ) a number of persons entrusted with the publication of the decree ( δόγ µ α ) are listed as coming εξ Υθυβιρων , εκ Παταρουσων , Αγγωρέας , Λαγινέας and Ωνδρέας respectively. S  ahin presumes that Υθυβιρα and Παταρουσα are villages or districts belonging to Koranza, whereas Αγγωρευacuteς , Λαγινευacuteς and ' Ωνδρευacuteς are demotics (S  ahin ( 1973 ) 191 -92 ). In later times Koranza was itself a civic subdivision of Stratonikeia. Envoys from Koranza are mentioned in a fragmentary C4 inscription from Mylasa ( I.Mylasa 8 . 9 ), and a keryx is listed in a treaty between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) ( SEG 40 992 . 8 ). In 367 / 6 Mausolos and the Koarendeis granted ateleia to a certain [. . .] ιδι ' Οσαρτηυacute µ ου Μ [ ά ] νηι , and in 318 the polis of Koranza granted politeia and enktesis to Konon, son of Poseidippos ( I.Stratonikeia 503 ). Apparently the Koarendeis met in an ekklesia kyria with some sacred kerykes ( I.Stratonikeia 503 . 5 -6 ; see Hornblower ( 1982 ) 71 -72 ). In C4 Chalketor (no. 881 ) passed a decree granting proxeny and citizenship to a man from Koranza ( I.Mylasa 911 ). Around 350 a man named Skoaranos and his wife dedicated a plot of land to Apollo and Artemis ( I.Stratonikeia 502 ). Moreover,the Koranzeis granted exemption from slave taxes and other taxes except for the royal one to anyone who looked after Skoaranos' tomb (ll. 20 -22 ). Two archons are mentioned in a decree of 318 ( I.Stratonikeia 503 . 3 ). A month name, ∆ῖος , from Koranza is known from a decree of 318 ( I.Stratonikeia 503 . 2 ). The names of the archons in the decree of 318 ( I.Stratonikeia 503 ) and the envoys from Koranza listed in I.Mylasa 8 and in SEG 40 992 . 7 -8 suggest that there was a strong Karian element in the Koranzan population, and it is a moot point to what extent the community can be considered a Hellenic polis in the Classical period."

910,Latmos (Latmios) /Herakleia (Herakleotes),Karia,37.3,27.3,1031,5153,"910 . Latmos (Latmios) /Herakleia (Herakleotes) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 30 , long. 27 . 30 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: β . The toponym is Λάτ µ ος , ηasper (Hecat. fr. 239 ; EA 29 ( 1997 ) 137 . 7 -8 , 323 -313 ), later ' Ηράκλεια , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 99 ; Strabo 14 . 1 . 8 ). According to Strabo 14 . 1 . 8 , the town was originally called Λάτ µ ος , and later the name was changed to ' Ηράκλεια ( ηasper υasperποgrave Λάτ µ Ωsubiotaω , to distinguish it from its homonyms). The latest attestation of the toponym Λάτ µ ος is in the abovementioned C4l inscription; the earliest attestation of ' Ηράκλεια is that of Ps.-Skylax 99 . The city-ethnic is Λάτ µ ιος ( I.Didyma 12 (C6s), restored: [ Λά ] τ µ ιοι ; IG i³ 260 . x . 3 ; EA 29 ( 1997 ) 137 . 14 ). The earliest possible attestation of the city-ethnic ' Ηρακλεώτης is on a Panathenaic amphora of C4m ( infra ); the earliest unquestionable attestation is in I.Priene 51 . 1 (C2s). Latmos/Herakleia is called a polis both in the urban sense ( EA 29 ( 1997 ) 137 . 27 -28 ; Ps.-Skylax 99 : polis Hel ) and in the political sense ( EA 29 ( 1997 ) 137 . 3 , 16 -17 , 18 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic ( Λάτ µ ιοι ) is attested internally in the treaty with Pidasa ( EA 29 ( 1997 ) 137 . 14 (C4l)) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 260 . x . 3 ) and in a C4m treaty between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) ( SEG 40 992 . 11 (C4m)). Three 'Lelegian'ring walls have been located in the territory of Latmos, two on Mt. Latmos and one on the southern bank of the Bafa Lake. They are all built in dry rubble masonry, and since there are no remains of buildings inside the perimeter, it is assumed that they were Fluchtburge (Peschlow-Bindokat ( 1996 ) 22 -23 ). Latmos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . x . 3 ) to 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . i . 64 ) a total of fourteen times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 tal. ( IG i³ 261 . ii . 29 ). The outstanding source for C4Latmos is the treaty with Pidasa ( EA 29 ( 1997 ) 137 ) about a physical and political amalgamation of the two poleis . The treaty was concluded in the period 323 -313 , but some of its information can be interpreted retrospectively to shed light on the social and political organisation of Latmos in the late Classical period: an agora ( 31 -32 ) and a temple of Athena ( 35 -36 ) are mentioned, and in the town of Latmos there is a publicly owned open space ( demosie ) where the Pidaseis can build their new houses ( 27 -29 ). The oath is to be taken by 200 Latmioi ( 30 ), and the citizens were organised into an unknown number of phylai and phratriai ( 6 -13 ; cf. Jones ( 1999 )). A board of timouchoi are to make a sacrifice in order to ensure the homonoia of the polis ( 2 -4 ). Latmos was abandoned in C4 and refounded under the name Herakleia. The date of the move is uncertain: PsSkylax mentions Herakleia ( 99 ), but not Latmos, and since no chapter of the Periplous is likely to be dated later than c. 330 (Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 137 -38 ), it must be presumed that Herakleia existed already by then. Hornblower's suggestion (( 1982 ) 320 ) that the move was initiated by Mausolos squares with Ps.-Skylax' account and with some fragments of a C4m Panathenaic amphora found at Labraunda and inscribed ' Ηρακλεώτης . Hellström argues that the ethnic must be interpreted as referring to Herakleia under Latmos (Hellström ( 1965 ) 8 ). If so, it suggests that a citizen of Herakleia participated in the Panathenaic Games in C4m. However, both the toponym Latmos and the city-ethnic Latmios are attested in the treaty between Latmos and Pidasa concluded in the period 323 -313 ( EA 29 ( 1997 ), supra ). The presumption is that,for a relatively short period of time, the two places existed simultaneously (already suggested by Hornblower) and that both city-ethnics could be used to designate a citizen of this community. The two sites are situated less than 1 km from each other (Peschlow-Bindokat ( 1996 ) 23 , Abb. 23 ). Latmos was unfortified until C4e, when the city wall was built and at the same time the city was enlarged. The city wall enclosed an area of c. 90 ha; it had fourteen towers, and two gates can be seen today. The city wall and the buildings erected at the same time as the wall are built in the same building technique: isodomic ashlar, headers and stretchers (Peschlow ( 1994 ) 155 ). There is not much left of Latmos, since building material was to a large extent employed in the building of Herakleia.At Latmos remains of 100 houses have been revealed. They are of various sizes, 20 -100 m ² , and almost invariably of quadrangular plan. In the centre of the city an agora has been identified (mentioned in EA 29 ( 1997 ) 31 -32 ). Sherds found at Latmos date from C6 -C5 (PeschlowBindokat ( 1996 ) 23 -27 ). The names of the Latmians listed in the treaty between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) ( SEG 40 992 . 11 ) suggest that there was a strong Karian element in the population of Latmos (Blümel ( 1990 ) 38 -42 ( = SEG 40 991 -92 ))."

The toponym is Μέδ µ ασος (Hecat. fr. 244 = Steph. Byz. 440 . 3 , where Meineke prefers the conjecture Μέδ µ ασα ). The city-ethnic is Μαδνασευacuteς ( IG i³ 261 . i . 32 ). The collective use of the cityethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 261 . i . 32 ). Medmasos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . i . 26 ) to 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . i . 13 ) a total of eleven times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 2 tal. in 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . i . 26 ) and 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . i . 32 ) and 1 tal. in the rest of the period ( IG i³ 263 . v . 27 ). Medmasos was one of the settlements which were synoecised into Halikarnassos (no. 886 ) by Mausolos c. 370 (Plin. HN 5 . 107 ; Hornblower ( 1982 ) 82 ; Demand ( 1990 ) 123 ). The site of Medmasos is c. 300 m long and enclosed by a circuit wall built in dry rubble or polygonal masonry, with gates and towers. The walls have been dated to c. 400 (Hornblower ( 1982 ) 96 ). There are house foundations and cisterns within the perimeter. Moreover, there is an inner perimeter with a tower built in ashlar masonry, enclosing a building complex. Sherds date the settlement to the Classical period (Bean and Cook ( 1955 ) 121 -22 , 155 ; cf. Hornblower ( 1982 ) 96 )."

Size of territory: ? Type: A: β . The toponym is Μυacuteλασα , τά (Hdt. 1 . 171 . 6 ; Men. Sicyonius 6 ; SEG 33 872 . 3 (C4l)) or Μυacuteλασος (Aesch. fr. 147 , Mette). The city-ethnic is Μυλασευacuteς ( IG i³ 267 . v . 31 ; I.Mylasa 1 . 3 ( 367 / 6 ); Hdt. 5 . 121 ). Mylasa is called a polis both in the urban sense (Arist. Oec . 1348 a 12 ) and in the political sense in a decree of 361 / 0 ( I.Mylasa 2 . 7 -9 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in the decree of 367 / 6 ( I.Mylasa 1 . 3 ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 267 . v . 31 ). The individual city-ethnic is attested externally in a C4m dedication from Labraunda ( I.Labraunda 17 ) and in a C4 Attic sepulchral inscription ( Agora xvii 519 . 7 ). In the territory of Mylasa were several forts, one of which is described at length by Radt ( 1969 -70 ). The fortification consists of a ring wall and, inside that, a fortified citadel. The whole complex is c. 400 m long, and the oldest parts were built in the Archaio-Classical period with additions in the early Heltic period. In addition to the three fortifications already known,yet another one was discovered in 1995 . The masonry is of the Classical period, and it overlooks the plain of Mylasa, but also Hydai to the west (Rumscheid ( 1996 ) 127 ). The name of the district Αρλαια (or perhaps Αρλαιθις ; see Blümel ( 1998 a ) 165 n. 9 ) in the territory of Mylasa is known from I.Mylasa 21 . 8 ( c. 317 ). Mylasa was a member of the Delian League.It belonged to the Karian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . i . 12 ) to 440 / 39 ( IG i³272 . ii . 76 , completely restored) a total of eight times, twice completely restored. Mylasa paid 1 tal. down to 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . ii . 105 ) and 5 , 200 dr. from 446 / 5 on ( IG i³ 267 . v . 31 ). Crampa argues that a very fragmentary C4l inscription concerns the democratic constitution of Mylasa ( I.Labraunda 41 ; see other possible restorations and interpretations in Hornblower ( 1982 ) 70 -71 with n. 128 ). Nomoi patrioi are mentioned in I.Mylasa 1 . 11 ( 367 / 6 ). A single Ionian month name is attested at Mylasa ( SEG 40 991 . 2 : µ ηνοgraveς [ Αρ ] τε µ ισιῶνος (C4m)). Three phylai are attested at Mylasa. A decree of 367 / 6 mentions αιasper τρεῖς φυλαί ( I.Mylasa 1 . 4 ; cf. I.Mylasa 2 . 4 , 3 . 13 ). The name of the phyle ' Οτωρκονδεῖς is attested frequently from C2 (see e.g. I.Mylasa 106 . 2 ); ' Υαρβεσυtildeται is attested once, in C2 ( I.Mylasa 301 . 3 ); and Κονοδωρκονδεῖς is attested once, in C2 ( I.Mylasa 119 . 14 ). In 357 -355 Erythrai (no. 845 ) bestowed proxeny and other honours upon Μαυacuteσσωλλος ' Εκατό µ νω Μυλασέυς (Tod 155 ). In C4 -C3 Delphi (no. 177 ) bestowed proxeny on Μοσχίων Μυλασευacuteς ( SEG 23 307 ). One inscription contains three decrees, dated to 367 / 6 , 361 / 0 and 355 / 4 respectively, dealing with plots against Mausolos (Tod 138 = I.Mylasa 1 -3 ). In the first case Arlissis, son of Thyssollos, had been sent as an envoy to the Persian king by the Karians and, while an envoy, had plotted against Mausolos and was subsequently executed on the king's orders.Moreover,the polis of Mylasa seized his property and handed it over to Mausolos. In the second case, the sons of Peldemos had damaged an image of Hekatomnos, father of Mausolos, thus wronging the sacred dedications, and the polis therefore confiscated their property and sold it. They may have sought refuge in Iasos (no. 891 ), because proxeny was granted in C4 to three men: Myrmex, Manes and Targelios, sons of Peldemis ( SEG 36 983 ; cf. Blümel ( 1998 b ) 171 ). In the third case Manita, son of Paktyes, plotted against Mausolos during the annual offering and festival of Zeus Labrandeus. Manitas himself was killed immediately in hand-to-hand fighting,and the polis confiscated the property of Manitas and his accomplice Thyssos,son of Syskos,and sold their estates. In all three cases the decrees are passed by the assembly, with the ratification of the three phylai , and curses are invoked on anyone who puts a question to the vote or proposes something which would change these decisions. Hdt. 1 . 171 . 6 mentions a sanctuary dedicated to Zeus Karios and calls it 'ancient' . Zeus Karios was also worshipped by the Mysians and the Lydians (Hdt. 1 . 171 . 6 ). Remains survive of the wall surrounding the temenos of the temple of Zeus Osogos; it probably dates to C5 (Bean ( 1971 ) 42 ). A temenos of Hermes and Herakles is attested c. 317 ( I.Mylasa 21 . 13 ). The cult centre of Mylasa was the sanctuary of Zeus at Labraunda, situated c. 15 km north of Mylasa and connected to it by a sacred way. Annual sacrifices and a panegyris are mentioned at I.Mylasa i 3 . 4 -5 . Strabo mentions the road and says that it measured 60 stades ( 10 . 8 km) ( 14 . 2 . 23 ). The road, of which parts have been preserved, was constructed in the Hekatomnid period (Westholm ( 1963 ) 9 -10 ). The sanctuary consists of several buildings: the temple itself (for which see Hellström and Thieme ( 1982 )), a peristyle, two andrones , two stoas and several other buildings ( PECS s.v.). Although the majority of the remaining buildings at Labraunda were constructed in C4 as part of the Hekatomnid building project, there was activity at the site earlier, as evidenced by Archaic buildings on the temple terrace (Westholm ( 1963 ) 105 ) and by sherds dating to the Protogeometric period and onwards (Jully ( 1981 )). In the area surrounding the sanctuary there are several forts, which may have been part of a defence system and which probably date to Hekatomnid period (Westholm ( 1963 ) 13 -15 ). The acropolis at Labraunda is also of Hekatomnid date (ibid. 15 -19 ). Strabo says that Mylasa used to be a kome , and on the basis of this, Radt assumes that Mylasa was not a conurbation in the Archaic and Classical periods but that it consisted of 'einzelne Flecken und Gehöfte' , comparing it with the settlement pattern of the Halikarnassian peninsula before the Mausolan synoecism (Radt ( 1969 -70 ) 167 ). However, Rumscheid argues that Mylasa probably existed already by C7f (( 1995 ) 77 -78 , ( 1999 ) 206 ). In Arist. Oec . 1348 a 12 -13 Mylasa is described as ateichistos in the 360 s. Accepting the account as historical, Rumscheid argues that Mylasa did not have a city wall, but that it was protected by a number of fortifications in the territory (Rumscheid ( 1999 ) with fig. 3 ). A palaistra and a gymnasion are mentioned in an inscription of c. 317 ( I.Mylasa 21 . 9 , 12 ). It is generally stated that Mylasa did not strike coins until C3l (Akarca ( 1959 ) 11 ; Head, HN ² 622 ), except for the bronze coins struck by the dynast Eupolemos in his own name at the time of Alexander or a little later. Obv . three Makedonian shields; rev . sword in sheath; legend: ΕΥΠΟΛΕΜΟΥ ( HN ² 622 ). However, Hurter describes two Mylasian tetradrachms in the so-called Pixodaros hoard, which was deposited c. 330 (Hurter ( 1998 ) 147 -50 ). These two coins have obv . Zeus Labraundios, rev . Zeus Osogos (a combination of Zeus and Poseidon) holding a trident and an eagle."
914,Myndos (Myndios),Karia,37.05,27.15,712,3450,"914 . Myndos (Myndios) Map 61 . Lat. 37 . 05 , long. 27 . 15 . Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Μυacuteνδος , ηasper (Hecat. fr. 243 ; Diod. 20 . 37 . 1 ; Strabo 13 . 1 . 59 ). The city-ethnic is Μυacuteνδιος ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 141 ). Myndos is implicitly classified as a polis Hel in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 99 ; cf. Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 , and it is retrospectively called a polis in the political sense by Arr. Anab . 1 . 20 . 6 (r 334 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on Heltic coins ( SNG Cop. Caria 439 -43 : ΜΥΝ∆ΙΩΝ (C2 -C1 )) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 86 ). For the individual and external use, see Hdt. 5 . 33 . 3 ; I.Knidos 23 . 9 -10 (C2 ). Hdt. 5 . 33 . 2 mentions a Myndian ship in the fleet of Aristagoras c. 500 . Myndos was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is recorded in the tribute lists from 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . vi . 16 ) to 421 / 0 ( IG i³ 285 . i . 92 -93 ) a total of nineteen times, four times completely restored, paying a phoros of 500 dr., except in 421 / 0 when it paid 1 , 000 dr. It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 141 ), 1 , 000 dr. Myndos must have defected from Athens during the Dekeleian War, since at Delphi the statues of those who fought with Lysander at Aigos potamoi in 405 included one of Theopompos of Myndos (Paus. 10 . 9 . 10 ). In 334 Alexander attacked Myndos, which, however, resisted his assault because of the failure of a secret agreement between Alexander and a faction behind the walls (Arr. Anab . 1 . 20 . 5 -7 ). Citing the C4 historian Kallisthenes of Olynthos, Strabo says that when Mausolos synoecised some poleis into Halikarnassos (no. 886 ), Myndos was left as it was (Strabo 13 . 1 . 59 ; Callisthenes ( FGrHist 124 ) fr. 25 ). The coastal site on the tip of the Halikarnassos peninsula does not go further back than the Mausolan period, so 'old Myndos' must be sought elsewhere (cf. the distinction between Myndos and Palaimyndos, Plin. HN 5 . 107 ; Steph. Byz. 462 . 4 ). Bean and Cook identify 'Lelegian' Myndos with a site not far from 'new Myndos' . It is generally assumed that it was Mausolos who initiated the move (Hornblower ( 1982 ) 97 ). At the hilltop site of 'old Myndos'very little remains. There are foundations of a tower in irregular masonry and a ring wall in loose polygonal or dry rubble masonry.Sherds seem to indicate that the site was abandoned in C4e (Bean and Cook ( 1955 ) 118 ). At the site of 'new Myndos' there are remains of an outer circuit in ashlar masonry, which must have been c. 3 . 5 km long and enclosed an area of c. 45 ha.We know from Arr. Anab . 1 . 20 . 6 that Myndos was walled in 334 . McNicoll suggests that the walls were erected after 367 and before 334 (( 1997 ) 23 ). Furthermore, there is a so-called Lelegian wall, which is, however, too recent to be 'Lelegian' and is of different masonry (Hornblower ( 1982 ) 305 -6 ). McNicoll suggests that this wall was built after 334 . It is in hammer-faced isodomic ashlar, whereas the tower to the north-east is in isodomic ashlar masonry with headers and stretchers (McNicoll ( 1997 ) 22 -24 ). Nothing remains of the foundations of temples and the stadion seen by Newton (( 1863 ) 575 -77 ; cf. Bean and Cook ( 1955 ) 108 -12 , 118 , 145 ). According to Ps.-Skylax 99 , Myndos had a harbour (cf. Strabo 14 . 2 . 20 )."

The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 261 . v . 8 ). In IG i³ 267 . iii . 29 Meritt's restoration: Ναχσία παραgrave Μ [ υδ ]( όνα ) is far from certain, but L. Robert's suggestion (( 1978 ) 481 n. 32 ) that Μ [. . .] stands for Miletos or Myous is in conflict with the recording of Naxia in the Karian district ( IG i³ 271 . i . 73 ). Naxia was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is registered in the Athenian tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . i . 25 ) to 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 280 . i . 32 ) a total of thirteen times, twice completely restored. It is recorded once by toponym ( IG i³ 267 . iii . 29 ), and otherwise by cityethnic, paying a phoros of, first, 1 , 000 dr.

On the equation of the Hylimeis as the inhabitants of Olymos, see L. Robert ( 1955 ) 226 -27 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 39 ). Olymos was a member of the Delian League. It is recorded for the first time in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 39 ), and then possibly in 448 / 7 ( IG i³ 264 . iv . 29 : [h υλι µ˜ ε ] ς ) and 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 86 , completely restored). The amount paid by Olymos is unknown. It is absent from the full panel of 440 / 39 ( IG i³ 271 . i -ii . 63 -86 ). There are practically no archaeological remains left at the site of Olymos, but a large number of Heltic inscriptions bearing the toponym and the ethnic make the site identification certain ( I.Mylasa ii pp. 29 ff; Bean ( 1971 ) 48 )."

Size of territory: 1 or 2 . Type: B: γ . The toponym is Ουράνιον , τό (Diod. 5 . 53 , referring to some period after the Trojan War). The city-ethnic is Ουρανιήτης ( IG i³ 260 . i . 17 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 260 . i . 17 ) and in a C4m treaty ( SEG 40 992 . 16 ). Ouranion was a member of the Delian League, but it is recorded only twice in the tribute lists, in 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . i . 17 ), paying a phoros of 1 , 000 dr., and in 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 262 . v . 27 ), paying 500 dr. It is absent from the full panel of 440 / 39 ( IG i³ 271 . i -ii . 63 -86 ) but was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 117 ), paying in a syntelic group with some other Karian towns. A keryx from Ouranion is mentioned in a C4m treaty ( SEG 40 992 . 16 ). Ouranion was one of the settlements which were synoecised into Halikarnassos (no. 886 ) by Mausolos c. 370 (Plin. HN 5 . 107 ; Hornblower ( 1982 ) 82 ; Demand ( 1990 ) 123 ), but it seems likely that the place still functioned as a manned stronghold even after the civilian population had been moved (Hornblower ( 1982 ) 88 ). Atthe site of Ouranion there are remains of a fortification which is c. 50 m long and enclosed by a wall built in coursed masonry. The fortifications have vertical drafting at the edges, which points to a C4 date (Hornblower ( 1982 ) 95 ). There are remains of an outer perimeter in polygonal masonry. Sherds found at the site were of the Archaic and Classical periods (Bean and Cook ( 1955 ) 117 -18 ). According to Diod. 5 . 53 , Ouranion was settled by Karians fleeing from the island of Syme because of drought, some- time after the Trojan War. The names listed in in the C4m treaty mentioned above suggest that there was a strong Karian element in the population of Ouranion (Blümel ( 1990 ) 38 -42 ( = SEG 40 991 -92 )), and it is a moot point to what extent it can be considered a Hellenic polis in the Archaic and Classical periods."

The toponym is Πήδασα , τά (Strabo 13 . 1 . 59 ). The city-ethnic is Πηδασέυς ( Syll . ³ 46 . 140 (C5 ); Hdt. 1 . 175 ). Pedasa is described as a polis in the urban sense at Hdt. 8 . 104 , but the passage is a repeat of a story told at 1 . 175 and is probably a late addendum. The external use of the city-ethnic is attested collectively at Hdt. 1 . 175 and individually at Syll . ³ 46 . 140 . A cult of Athena is attested at Hdt. 1 . 175 in connection with the story that the priestess of Athena grew a beard when an evil threatened the city. Pedasa was one of the settlements which were synoecised into Halikarnassos (no. 886 ) by Mausolos c. 370 (Strabo 13 . 1 . 59 ; Plin. HN 5 . 107 ; Hornblower ( 1982 ) 81 n. 24 ; Demand ( 1990 ) 123 ). The archaeological remains consist of a fortification, c. 170 m long, built in irregular masonry, with towers in squared masonry on the southern side. The walls enclose an area of 2 . 5 ha (Bean ( 1971 ) 121 ). There are traces of buildings inside the perimeter. To the east and south there is an outer perimeter in dry rubble masonry (Bean and Cook ( 1955 ) 123 -25 ; cf. Hornblower ( 1982 ) 308 )."

The toponym is Πίδασα , τά (Blümel ( 1997 ) 137 l. 8 ; Milet . i 3 149 . 15 (C2f)). The city-ethnic is Πεδασευacuteς ( IG i³ 260 . x . 7 ) or Πιδασευacuteς ( EA 29 ( 1997 ) 137 . 8 ). Pidasa is called a polis in the political sense in a C4l treaty with Latmos (no. 910 ) ( EA 29 ( 1997 ) 137 . 16 -18 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 260 . x . 7 ). For the individual and external use, see Milet . i 3 41 . iii . 4 (C2s). The Pidaseis were members of the Delian League. They are recorded in the tribute lists from 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 5 ) to 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 14 ) a total of five times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 2 tal. in 453 / 2 and 451 / 0 ( IG i³ 260 . x . 7 ), but 1 tal. in 447 / 6 ( IG i³ 265 . i . 14 ). They are absent from the full panel of 441 / 0 ( IG i³ 271 . i -ii . 63 -86 ) but were assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 149 ), 3 tal. The Pidaseis/Pedaseis of the tribute lists were not the Pedaseis in the Halikarnassian peninsula; see ATL i. 535 ; cf. Blümel ( 1997 ) 139 ; pace Cook ( 1961 b ) 95 ). A psephisma passed between 323 and 313 records a treaty between Pidasa and Latmos, called politeuma in the decree ( 41 ) (Blümel ( 1997 ); Habicht ( 1998 ); Jones ( 1999 )). The treaty prescribes both a physical and a political amalgamation of the two poleis . Pidasa holds a subordinate position to that of Latmos and is in fact incorporated into Latmos: all Pidaseis, hitherto organised into their own phylai and phratriai , are to be inscribed either into a new phyle or into one of the Latmian phylai ( 4 -10 ); a common financial administration is set up ( 14 -20 ), and some of the Pidaseis are supposed to move to Latmos ( 27 -28 ). In the treaty with Latmos, 100 Pidasian citizens, selected by the Latmioi, are to swear to the treaty ( 29 ). It has been suggested that these 100 men constituted almost the whole number of citizens of Pidasa (Habicht ( 1998 ) 10 ), but the fact that the 100 citizens were selected by the Latmioi indicates that the total number of Pidasan citizens was considerably higher. The site of Pidasa has been identified by Cook (( 1961 ) 91 -96 ; cf. L. Robert ( 1978 )). The scanty remains consist of a fortification c. 200 m long in coursed masonry. Tiles found inside the perimeter point to a C4 -C3e date. At a distance of c. 300 m is a watch-tower built with square blocks."

Pladasa is called a polis in the political sense in a proxeny decree of 319 / 8 (Varinlio˘ glu et al. ( 1990 ) = SEG 40 996 . 6 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is used internally in a proxeny decree of 319 / 18 ( SEG 40 996 . 10 ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 264 . i . 11 ) and in a C4m treaty between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) ( SEG 40 992 . 12 ). The individual city-ethnic is used externally on an undated grave inscription from Chalke ( IG xii . 1 962 b). Pladasa was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is registered in the tribute lists from 448 / 7 ( IG i³ 264 . i . 11 ) to 440 / 39 ( IG i³ 272 . i . 89 ) a total of five times, once completely restored, paying a phoros of 2 , 000 dr.

Anenvoy from Pladasa is listed in a treaty from Mylasa of c. 354 / 3 ( SEG 40 992 . 13 ). In 319 / 18 Pladasa granted proxenia , politeia and enktesis to Kratesippos, son of Polyon, from Plataiai ( SEG 40 996 . 15 -17 ). One month name from Pladasa is attested in the proxeny decree of 319 / 18 . The name of the month is Κοροβαλλισσις , a Karian name ( SEG 40 996 . 4 ). The names listed in the treaty between Mylasa and Kindye ( SEG 40 992 . 12 -13 ) suggest that there was a strong Karian element in the Pladasian population, and it is a moot point to what extent the community can be considered a Hellenic polis in the Classical period."

Strabo 14 . 16 . 1 describes Salmakis as a fountain. From SEG 43 713 . 11 and 13 it appears that it was a district or area in Halikarnassos. The site has been identified via an inscription found in 1995 (Isager ( 1998 )). However, in C5f the Salmakians were clearly some kind of political community, passing a law with the Halikarnassians and the tyrant Lygdamis. The Halikarnassians and the Salmakians formed the syllogos of Halikarnassos ( Syll . ³ 45 . 1 -2 = ML 32 ), and they may constitute what is referred to as Αasperλικαρνασσεῖς συacute µ παντες ( 41 -42 ). Moreover, the Salmakians had their own magistrates ( 13 -15 : Σαλ µ ακιτέων µ νη µ ονευόντων Μεγαβατέω . . . καιgrave Φορ µ ίωνος ). It is a possibility that they had polis status at the time, but were incorporated into Halikarnassos (no. 886 ) not too long after. See also Isager ( 1998 ) 10 , comm. to l. 16 ."

Size of territory: 2 or 3 . Type: A: γ . The toponym is Συάγγελα , τά (Kallisthenes ( FGrHist 124 ) fr. 25 , quoted by Strabo 13 . 1 . 59 ; Kramer's emendation of συναγέλα (MSS CDx) and συgraveν αγέλΩsubiotaα (MSS hmowz), later Θεάγγελα , τά ( Staatsverträge 429 . 25 ( c. 310 ); Steph. Byz. 308 . 6 ). The city-ethnic is Συαγγελευacuteς ( IG i³ 284 . 7 -8 ; SEG 40 991 . 13 ( 354 / 3 ); C4 -C3 coins), later Θεαγγελευacuteς ( IG ii² 1956 . ii . 98 ( c. 300 ); I.Iasos 50 . 4 (C4 -C3 )). In a treaty with Eupolemos of c. 310 ( Staatsverträge 429 ) Theangela is called a polis both in the urban sense ( 20 ) and in the political sense ( 24 ). In a C4m treaty between Mylasa (no. 913 ) and Kindye (no. 902 ) the Syangeleis are among the city-ethnics listed after the heading παρηtildeσαν αποgrave πόλεων , where polis is used in the political sense ( SEG 40 991 . 13 ). The collective use of the cityethnic is attested internally on coins ( ΣΥ (C4 -C3 ), infra ) and in the treaty with Eupolemos ( Θεαγγελεῖς , Staatsverträge 429 . 26 ) and externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 284 . 7 -8 ) and in the C4m treaty ( SEG 40 991 . 13 ). The individual city-ethnic is used externally in the Athenian tribute lists ( IG i³ 259 . v . 16 ) and in a C4 -C3 proxeny decree ( I.Iasos 50 . 4 ). Syangela (at modern Kaplan (Radt ( 1970 ) 224 or Alâzeytin (Blümel ( 1990 ) 37 ) and Theangela (at modern Etrim) were both pre-Heltic settlements, situated a few kilometers apart. The original centre of the polis was at Syangela. In, perhaps, C6m the centre was moved to the other site, but the name was kept. It was probably Mausolos who had the polis renamed Theangela,but for half a century the old toponym and city-ethnic were used alongside the new ones (Radt ( 1970 ); Hornblower ( 1982 ) 97 -99 ; Franke ( 1984 ); Blümel ( 1990 ) 37 ). At the site of Theangela there are remains of a perimeter c. 3 km long, with a rectangular fort with four towers, in different types of masonry; the wall encloses an area of 25 ha (Bean and Cook ( 1955 ) 112 -16 , ( 1957 ) 89 -96 ). Syangela was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district and is registered in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . v . 16 ) to 427 / 6 or 426 / 5 ( IG i³ 284 . 7 -8 ) a total of fifteen times, four times completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 tal. ( IG i³ 263 . i . 14 -15 ). In 454 / 3 the community is recorded by its ruler: Πίκρες Συαν [ γελευacuteς ] ( IG i³ 259 . v . 16 ); in 451 / 0 the entry is Συ [ αγγελ ˜ ες ] h[ ˜ ον Πίκρες άρχει ] ( IG i³ 263 . i . 14 -15 ); the restoration is secured by the similar entry in 427 / 6 or 426 / 5 : Συαγγελ ˜ ες οaspertildeν αasperacuteρχει Πίτρες ( IG i³ 284 . 7 -8 ), restored also in IG i³ 282 . iv . 48 -49 . In all other years the Syangeleis are recorded by city-ethnic alone. In 446 / 5 Syangela and Amynanda (no. 873 ) formed a syntely paying a phoros of 4 , 500 dr. ( IG i³ 266 . iii . 20 -21 ), but in 444 / 3 the two communities paid 3 , 000 dr. each ( IG i³ 268 . iv . 25 -26 ). Syangela was possibly assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 111 , completely restored). In 454 / 3 Syangela is represented by Pikres Syangeleus, who appears again in 427 / 6 as Συαγγελ ˜ ες ωaspertildeν άρχει Πίτρες , and this shows that Syangela was ruled by a local dynast. Like Myndos (no. 914 ), Syangela (renamed Theangela) was kept out of the synoecism of Halikarnassos by Mausolos c. 370 (Kallisthenes ( FGrHist 124 ) fr. 25 , pace Plin. HN 5 . 107 ; Hornblower ( 1982 ) 82 ; Demand ( 1990 ) 123 ). In C4l or C3e Menyllos Nossou Theangeleus was granted proxeny by Iasos (no. 891 ) ( I.Iasos 50 . 4 ). A keryx from Syangela is mentioned in the C4m treaty between Mylasa and Kindye ( SEG 40 991 . 15 ). The names listed in the treaty between Mylasa and Kindye suggest that there was a strong Karian element in the population of Syangela ( SEG 40 991 . 13 -15 ; see Blümel ( 1990 ) 38 -42 ( = SEG 40 992 )), and it is a moot point to what extent the community can be considered a Hellenic polis in the Archaic and Classical periods. Some coins inscribed with ΣΥ and formerly attributed to Syros (no. 523 ) and Syme (no. 522 ) respectively were in all probability struck by Syangela. Of eight coins one can be dated c. 390 .

Franke ( 1984 ) assigns two more coins, one of which is a trihemiobol,to Syangela.He dates these two coins to C5l and argues on historical grounds that the silver coinage of Syangela must be dated to the period 413 -391 ."

The toponym is Τήλανδρον , τό or Τηλάνδρεια , ηasper (Alex. Polyh. ( FGrHist 273 ) fr. 54 = Steph. Byz. 620 . 10 -12 ), whereas Steph. Byz. 620 . 10 lists Τήλανδρος as the name of a polis in Karia and Τηλανδρία as a promontory. Plin. HN 5 . 131 describes Telandria as an island with a deserted oppidum ; but according to Quintus Smyrnaeus 4 . 7 -11 , the city of Telandros lay inland on the bank of the Glaukos river (Nif Çay).Following Philippson ( 1910 -13 ) and followed by Barr ., ATL i. 555 argues that the polis of Telandros was situated on the island of Telandria, to be identified with Tersane. ATL also attaches the reference in Steph. Byz. to this island (almost certainly incorrectly). Heberdey (Map of Lycia in TAM I) identifies the island of Telandria with Avthoki, where there is a ruined watch-tower (Bean ( 1978 ) 36 (date?), and the polis of Telandros with the inland site of Nif Köy (following Arkwright ( 1895 ) 94 ). This is treated with scepticism by e.g. Ruge ( 1934 ) and L. Robert (( 1980 ) 377 -80 , accepting the ATL identification), but Arkwright may be correct. No matter whether the classical polis was situated inland or on the island, there can be no doubt that the city-ethnic is Τελάνδριος , recorded in the Athenian tribute lists as a member of the Delian League.It belonged to the Karian district ( IG i³ 269 . iv . 13 ), later incorporated into the Ionian district ( IG i³ 279 . i . 10 ). It is registered in the tribute lists from 453 / 2 ( IG i³ 260 . i . 11 , completely restored) to 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 279 . i . 10 ) a total of ten times, twice completely restored, paying a phoros of 1 tal.

An inscription of c. 300 mentions a Telemessian Apollo giving an oracular response ( Syll . ³ 1044 . 8 -9 ). A citizen of Telemessos was granted proxenia by Anaphe (no. 474 ) ( IG xii . 3 251 . 23 -25 (C4 )). Telmissus was one of the towns which were synoecised into Halikarnassos (no. 886 ) by Mausolos c. 370 (Plin. HN 5 . 107 ; Hornblower ( 1982 ) 82 ; Demand ( 1990 ) 123 )."

( IG i³ 271 . ii . 77 ); for a possible explanation of this reduction, see Bean and Cook ( 1955 ) 116 -18 ). Termera was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 154 ). Termera was one of the settlements which were synoecised into Halikarnassos (no. 886 ) by Mausolos c. 370 (Plin. HN 5 . 107 ; Hornblower ( 1982 ) 82 ; Demand ( 1990 ) 123 ). The archaeological remains at Termera consist of a citadel c. 40 m long with remains of a wall in squared masonry. Inside the walls there are traces of buildings and a cistern, possibly of the Classical period.There seems to have been an outer circuit in polygonal masonry-in places the wall stands to a height of 5 m-probably dating from C5 , and inside this circuit are traces of habitation, along with sherds of C5 and C4e (Bean and Cook ( 1955 ) 116 -18 ).

Tralleis is called a polis in the political sense at Arr. Anab . 1 . 18 . 1 and in the urban sense at Diod. 14 . 36 . 2 (r 400 ). The collective city-ethnic is attested internally in a decree of C4m ( I.Tralleis 3 ). The only known public anactment is the C4m decree ( supra ) which concerns a sanctuary of Dionysos. The principal divinity of Tralleis, however, was Zeus Larasios (bronze coins of C3e, Head, HN ² 659 ; I.Tralleis 25 . 12 (C3 )). Xen. Hell . 3 . 2 . 19 says Tralleis is in Karia, whereas Diod. 14 . 36 . 2 calls it a polis in Ionia. In 400 Tralleis was not walled, but occupied such a strong position that Thibron was unable to take it (Diod. 14 . 36 . 2 ; cf. Strabo 14 . 1 . 42 ).

The toponym is Φάσηλις , -ιδος , ηasper (Hdt. 2 . 178 . 2 ; Thuc. 2 . 69 . 1 , 8 . 88 ; Lycurg. Leoc . 73 (emended); Strabo 14 . 3 . 9 ) or Φασηλίς (Ps.-Skylax 100 ; Pseudo-Aristotle 973 a 8 ; Polyb. 30 . 9 . 4 ; Aristodemos ( FGrHist 104 ) fr. 1 . 13 . 2 (rC5m)). The city-ethnic is Φασηλίτης ( IG i³ 10 . 5 , 8 , 13 , 17 (C5s); TAM ii 1183 . 3 , 4 , 10 (C4m); Theodectas, TrGF 72 T 2 (epitaph of C4 )). Phaselis is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax and in the political sense by Herodotos ( 2 . 178 . 2 -3 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins of C5f and C4 ( infra ) and in a treaty with Mausolos of Karia ( TAM ii 1183 . 3 , 4 , 10 ), and externally in an Athenian decree regulating relations with Phaselis ( IG i³ 10 . 5 ) and in literary sources (Dem. 35 . 1 ). The individual use is attested externally both in inscriptions ( IG i³ 1360 ; CID ii 4 . i . 72 -73 ; IG xii 6 32 . 4 ( 306 -301 )) and in literary sources (Theodectas ( TrGF 72 T 2 ); Dem. 35 . 10 ). Ps.-Skylax and Strabo place Phaselis in Lykia; Aristodemos and Suda ( Φ 121 ) place it in Pamphylia; it is in Solyma according to the Lindos Temple Chronicle (( FGrHist 532 ) fr. c. 24 ). That Phaselis possessed a territory is shown by the report of Kimon ravaging the χώρα c. 469 (Plut. Cim . 12 ); it is also mentioned by Arrian ( Anab . 1 . 24 . 6 (r 334 / 3 )). Lyrnateia probably bordered on Phaselis ((Arist.) 973 a 8 ). In the Peace of Kallias in 449 Phaselis is the boundary west of which Persian fleets were not allowed to sail (Diod. 12 . 4 . 5 ). Phaselis was supposedly colonized from Lindos on Rhodes in 691 / 0 (Euseb. 93 b. 2 , Helm; Blumenthal ( 1963 )), and at Plut. Cim . 12 . 3 the people of Phaselis are recorded as Hellenes. The oikistes was supposedly Lakios (Aristainetos ( FGrHist 771 ) fr. 1 ; Ath. 7 . 297 E-298 A), a native of either Lindos or Argos (Philostephanos FHG iii 29 ), but he is possibly mythical; for the earliest attested version of the foundation myth,from C5 / 4 , see Herophytos fr. 1 . Phaselis is listed as one of the four Dorian poleis involved in the foundation of Naukratis (Hdt. 2 . 178 . 2 ). Phaselis was a member of the Delian League. It belonged to the Karian district ( IG i³ 269 . iv . 9 ), later incorporated into the Ionian district ( IG i³ 279 . i . 46 ). It was forced to join the League c. 469 (Plut. Cim . 12 . 3 -4 ) and is registered in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 24 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 17 ) a total of fifteen times, three times completely restored, paying a phoros of 6 tal. ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 24 ), reduced to 3 tal. in 450 / 49 ( IG i³ 263 . ii . 35 ), but changed again before 433 / 2 ( IG i³ 272 . i . 90 ), either back to 6 tal. or further reduced to 2 tal. It was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 129 ). In 411 Phaselis had fallen into Persian hands and was occupied by a Spartan force (Thuc. 8 . 99 ). Phaselis also had a longstanding friendship with Chios (Plut. Cim . 12 ). Phaselis made a treaty with Mausolos in the 350 s ( TAM ii 1183 . 3 , 4 , 10 ), apparently on equal terms. Proxenia and citizenship were received from Samos in 306 -301 by Timophanes son of Archepolis ( IG xii 6 32 ). Mutual legal arrangements ( ξυ µ βολαιgrave αιasper δίκαι ) existed in C5 with Athens ( IG i³ 10 ); disputes between Athenians and Phaseliots were to be tried at Athens. For the close commercial relations in C4 between Phaselis and Athens, see Dem. 35 . 1 et passim . Phaselis had a cult of Athena Polias ( TAM ii 1184 , not later than C5 ). There was also an annual sacrifice to Kylabras,dating to the colony's foundation (Ath. 7 . 297 E-298 A, citing Herophytos ( FGrHist 448 ) fr. 1 and Philostephanos ( FHG iii 29 )). Phaselis was one of the cities responsible for building the Hellenion at Naukratis in C6 (Hdt. 2 . 178 . 2 -3 ), and made dedications to Athena on Lindos (Burn ( 1960 ) 48 n. 19 ). The city was fortified c. 469 (Plut. Cim . 12 . 3 -4 ) and a few remains of the C5fortifications are still extant. As rebuilt c. 300 , they enclosed an area of c. 20 ha (Schäfer ( 1981 ) 49 -86 ; for the dates, see 54 , 58 , 84 , 164 -66 ). A fortified settlement on a hill north of the city dates to the Heltic period (Schläger and Schafer ( 1971 ); Schäfer ( 1981 ) 125 -35 ). An agora is mentioned in the context of 334 / 3 by Plutarch ( Alex . 18 . 4 ). Ps.-Skylax notes Phaselis' limen ( πόλις καιgrave λι µ ήν ), which is archaeologically visible. The were in fact two harbours, one north and one south of the acropolis. Phaselis struck silver coins on the Persian standard from before c. 550 .

943,Xanthos (Xanthios),Lykia,,,1381,6711,"943 . Xanthos (Xanthios) Map 65 . Lat. 36 . 20 , long: 29 . 20 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: β . The toponym is Ξάνθος , ηasper (Hdt. 1 . 176 . 3 , denoting the city; Hecat. fr. 255 , denoting the river). The city-ethnic is Ξάνθιος (Hdt. 1 . 176 . 2 -3 ; SEG 36 1216 . i . 1 , 8 -9 ( 340 -34 )). Steph. Byz. 123 . 12 -14 records an alternative toponym, Αacuteρνα , derived from Lykian Arñna (Melchert ( 1993 ) 6 ). Xanthos is called a polis in the urban sense on Erbbina's statue base ( SEG 39 1414 . 24 (C4e)) and in a tax exemption decree from Xanthos issued by Pixodaros, polis in the urban sense refers to the inhabitants of Xanthos, as well as those of Tlos, Pinara and Kadyanda ( SEG 36 1216 . 4 ( 340 -334 )). Finally Xanthos is called polis by Ps.-Skylax 100 (as restored by Müller). Polis in the political sense is attested on a trilingual cult inscription from the Letoön (Neumann ( 1979 ) N 320 .b. 18 = SEG 27 342 ( 337 )), but the Greek text is a translation of the Lykian (Blomqvist ( 1982 ); Briant ( 1998 ) 307 ). The Lykian word rendered by polis is teteri , for which see Kolb and Tietz ( 2001 ) 395 . Xanthos is called an άστυ by Herodotos ( 1 . 176 . 1 ) and on Erbbina's statue base ( SEG 39 1414 . 5 -6 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the tax exemption edict of Pixodaros ( SEG 36 1216 . i . 1 -2 , 8 -9 ) and the trilingual cult inscription ( SEG 27 942 . 5 -6 ), and externally by Herodotos ( 1 . 176 . 2 -3 ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in a C3e bilingual epitaph from Kition ( SEG 40 1355 ) and in literary sources ( Suda Π 2963 (rC4 )). Decrees of Xanthos set up at the Letoön (e.g. Neumann ( 1979 ) N 320 ) indicate that the sanctuary was part of the territory of Xanthos (Schweyer ( 1996 ) 28 -29 ). Xanthos probably had upland estates, which is where those who escaped the destruction of the city in c. 540 (Hdt. 1 . 176 . 3 ) were (Bean ( 1978 ) 50 ). Xanthos is placed in Lykia by Hekataios, Herodotos ( 1 . 176 . 3 ) and Ps.-Skylax ( 100 ). The city was destroyed, and the mass of the population killed, in an act of mass suicide c. 540 (Hdt. 1 . 176 . 1 -2 ; App. B Civ . 4 . 10 . 80 ; Plut. Brut . 31 . 7 ) and subsequently resettled by επήλυδες (Hdt. 1 . 176 . 3 ). Xanthos may have been a member of the Delian League,if a reference to Xanthos is concealed in the entry Λυacuteκιοι ( IG i³ 261 . i . 30 , 262 . v . 33 ) and Λυacuteκιοι καιgrave συν [ τελ ] ( IG i³ 266 . iii . 34 ; see Bean ( 1978 ) 25 ; Keen ( 1998 ) 40 ). In this case, it was included in the Καρικοgraveς φόρος , and the syntely paid 10 tal. of tribute in 446 / 5 . Menekrates of Xanthos (( FGrHist 769 ) fr. 1 = Steph. Byz. 129 . 3 ) mentions Xanthian presbutai in a mythological context; note also that Jacoby suggests a possible reading here of πολίτας instead of πρεσβυacuteτας . A joint decree of Xanthians and perioikoi stipulates the foundation of a cult for Basileus Kaunios ( SEG 27 942 . 5 -6 : έδοξε δηgrave Ξανθίοις καιgrave τοῖς περιοίκοις , where περίοικοι is a translation of epew¯ etlmm¯ ei in the Lykian original). The opposition has been interpreted as a purely geographical (Keen ( 1998 ) 55 -56 ) or an institutionalised (Wörrle ( 1978 ) 238 ) distinction between the Xanthians settled in the city and those in the hinterland. In the latter case the two strata of population were probably hierarchically organised rather than equal; analogy with other perioikic populations suggests that they were usually dependent communities (Domingo Gygax ( 2001 ) 19 -40 ). It should be added, however, that joint decisions made by polis and perioikoi are known from Lykia only, and probably reflect Lykian rather than Greek institutions. The trilingual inscription attests an epimeletes ( SEG 27 942 . 4 -5 ), probably appointed by the local satrap (Bryce ( 1986 ) 133 ), and a hiereus of Basileus Kaunios and Arkesimas,appointed by the people of Xanthos ( SEG 27 942 . 8 ). Lykian-language inscriptions (e.g. TAM i 36 (C5 -C4 )) mention officials called miñti (on which see Bryce ( 1986 ) 121 -23 ). SEG 42 1245 . 3 ( c. 400 ) identifies an agora, in which there was a temenos of the Lykian Twelve Gods (Tritsch ( 1942 ) 41 -42 ; Picard ( 1951 ) 137 -38 ; Martin ( 1951 ) 169 -74 ). Menekrates fr. 2 . 3 records a hieron of Apollo. On the Lykian acropolis are a C6sanctuary (Metzger et al . ( 1963 ) 29 -36 ) and the foundations of a building with three cellas ( 12 × 10 . 3 m), a C5sanctuary of a divinity, perhaps Artemis (Metzger et al . ( 1963 ) 40 -42 ; identified from a Heltic inscription). Appian ( B Civ . 4 . 10 . 78 -9 ) records a Σαρπηδόνειον , probably to be identified with a C5 building on the acropolis (Keen ( 1992 ) 55 -56 , ( 1996 )). Three temples are known from the Letoön, dated to the Classical period by Metzger et al . ( 1992 ) but probably Heltic (Erik Hansen, pers. comm.). For cults of Basileus Kaunios and Arkesimas, see Metzger et al . ( 1979 )). There is a dynastic residence on the acropolis (Metzger et al . ( 1963 ) 16 -23 ; Bean ( 1978 ) 55 ). The Classical acropolis,mentioned by Herodotos ( 1 . 176 . 1 ), was the lower of two hills on the site, on which a c. 475 -50 polygonal wall survives (Metzger et al . ( 1963 ) 16 -23 ; Bean ( 1978 ) 54 ). Further walls encompass the so-called Heltic acropolis; Herodotos ( 1 . 176 ) implies that the city was walled and capable of withstanding siege. The city had walls in the Heltic period (Plut. Brut . 30 . 8 , 31 . 2 , 4 ), of which much of the circuit and the south gate survive (Metzger et al . ( 1963 ) 9 -10 for the circuit). There is an 'early' polygonal wall at the Letoön (Bean ( 1978 ) 63 ). (On walls, see also Ritter ( 1859 ) 1020 -21 ; Benndorf and Niemann ( 1884 ) 127 , 138 ; Robert and Robert ( 1983 ) 124 ff n. 4 .) Xanthos minted silver coins on the light Lykian standard c. 450 -370 . There is a variety of types including obv . head of Athena wearing crested helmet (the characteristic obv. motive from c. 425 in common with west Lykian cities); rev . head of Athena, or head of Apollo or eagle. All carry Lykian legends until c. 370 / 60 when the autonomous Lykian coinage ended ( Arñnaha/Arñnahe or abbreviation); most also carry a dynast's name (Mørkholm and Neumann ( 1978 ) M 205 a-b, 221 -223 c, 224 a-b, 240 a-d). In C5 Xanthian dynasts struck coins too on the heavy east Lykian standard and on the so-called middle standard (Mørkholm and Zahle ( 1972 ), ( 1976 ); Mørkholm and Neumann ( 1978 ); Vismara ( 1989 -96 ); Kolb and Tietz ( 2001 ); SNG Cop . suppl. 445 , 447 -48 , 455 , 460 , 496 A). It is a much debated problem to what extent Xanthos was a Hellenic community before the Heltic period. ## II. The Poleis"
944,Allaria (Allariotas),Crete,35.25,24.35,456,2357,"944 . Allaria (Allariotas) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 25 , long. 24 . 35 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: B. The toponym is Αλλαρία , ηasper ( IG xii . 3 328 (C3f)). The city-ethnic is Αλλαριώτας (coins, C4s-C3f; infra ); cf. Αλλαριώτης ( I.Cret . ii .i. 1 (from Teos) (C3l)); Αλλαριάτης (Polyb. 13 . 10 f. 4 ). The earliest attestation of Allaria as a polis occurs in a Heltic asylia decree ( I.Cret . ii .i. 1 (C3l) = Rigsby ( 1996 ) ²¹ Nixon et al . ( 1989 ) 207 . ²² For the sake of consistency I have followed the dates in Chaniotis ( 1996 ) for all Heltic Cretan inter-state agreements. ²³ For the earlier date, see Mikroyannakis ( 1968 ); for the later, see e.g. Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 34 -35 . ²⁴ Apellonia, *Aria ( Αριαῖοι ), *Hyrtaia ( ' Υρταῖοι ), Istron, Matala, Milatos, *Petra. no. 151 ). Allaria is included in the Inventory as a probable polis (type B) on the strength of the coins, which may be as early as c. 330 ( infra ). The collective use of the city-ethnic occurs internally on the coins ( infra ) and externally in the asylia decree ( I.Cret . ii .i. 1 (C3l)). The individual use is attested in Polyb. 5 . 63 . 12 , 65 . 7 (r 220 ). The location of Allaria is not certain, but is probably to be sought somewhere in west Crete near Eleutherna,perhaps at the eastern edge of the Rhethymno plain in the vicinity of the villages of Khamalevri and Stavromenos (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 1 -3 ). Surface remains indicate that two ancient settlements, one just north of Khamalevri and the other on the coast at Palaiokastro, Stavromenos, were occupied during the Archaic and Classical periods (S. Hood et al . ( 1964 ) 62 -66 ; Schiering ( 1982 ); Barr . only H and later). Excavations in the vicinity of Khamalevri, have revealed buildings of the late Classical-early Heltic periods (Gavrilaki and Tzifopoulos ( 1998 ) 343 n. 4 ). Allaria should perhaps be identified with the site at Khamalevri, and Pantomatrion with the one at Stavromenos (Faure ( 1988 ) 85 -86 , ( 1993 ) 72 ; cf. Andreadaki-Vlasaki ( 1995 )). Allaria struck coins (drachms) on the Aiginetan standard during the period c. 330 -280 / 270 (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 190 , 198 ; but Manolis Stefanakis (pers. comm.) says C2e at the earliest). Types: obv . head of Athena; rev . Herakles standing; legend: ΑΛΛΑΡΙΩΤΑ ( Ν ), sometimes retrograde (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. I. 1 -2 ; SNG Cop.Aeg.Isl . 321 )."
945,Anopolis (Anopolites),Crete,35.15,24.05,443,2325,"945 . Anopolis (Anopolites) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 15 , long. 24 . 05 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: C. The toponym is Ανώπολις ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 109 ( c. 230 -210 ); SEG 8 269 (C3 )). The city-ethnic is Ανωπολίτας (unpublished proxeny decree of Lappa (C2 )) or Ανωπολίτης ( I.Cret . iv 179 ( c. 183 )). Noancient source calls Anopolis a polis . Stephanos identified Anopolis as another name for Araden: Αραδήν · πόλις Κρήτης , ηaspergrave καιgrave Ανώπολις λέγεται διαgrave τοgrave άνω εῖναι (Steph. Byz. 108 . 8 -9 ). This may reflect either the assimilation of Anopolis by Araden, both of which are included in the list of theorodokoi from Delphi ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) 1 -85 , iii . 108 -10 ( c. 230 -210 )), or some confusion due to the proximity of the two communities (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 6 ; cf. Perlman ( 1995 b ) 135 -36 ). Anopolis surely was a polis during the period C3s-C2 -as is attested by the Delphic theorodokos ( supra ), by the proxeny decree from Lappa ( supra ) and by its C3 bronze coins ( infra )-and this fact together with the material remains from the Classical period suggests that Anopolis was possibly a polis (type C) in the Classical period as well. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in a C2e alliance ( I.Cret . iv 179 ). For the individual use there is an unpublished proxeny decree of C2from Lappa for an Ανωπολίτας and the grave stele of Νεοτι µ άδας Ευπά µ ου Κρηgraveς Ανωπολίτης from Eretria ( IG xii . 9 819 (C1 )). The polis town of Anopolis was located on the summit and northern slopes of the coastal ridge north of Loutro (ancient Phoenix, the only winter harbour on Crete's south coast). The polis town was defended by a fortification wall with towers which may be no earlier than C3l (Nixon et al . ( 1989 ) 207 ). Parts of columns have been found on the ridge, but their date is uncertain (ibid. 208 ). Remains on the Anopolis plain to the north of the ridge represent isolated farms and small hamlets of several houses. Precise dates for these are not given, but in general the Classical and Heltic periods are better represented at Anopolis than is the Archaic period (ibid.). The western border of Anopolis (with Araden) probably followed the Araden gorge. Anopolis struck bronze fractions after c. 250 (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 7 ; Svoronos ( 1890 ) 5 -6 )."
946,Apellonia (Apelloniatas),Crete,35.25,25.0,494,2569,"946 . Apellonia (Apelloniatas) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 25 , long. 25 . 00 . Located at Ag. Pelagia on the north coast of Crete, c. 20 km west of Herakleion (Alexiou ( 1984 ); cf. Faure ( 1963 ) 16 -17 , ( 1993 ) 70 ). Size of territory: 2 . Type: C. The toponym is Απελλωνία , ηasper ( I.Cret . iv 182 ( c. 165 )) or Απολλωνία , ηasper ( I.Cret . i .iii. 1 (C3l)). The city-ethnic is Απελλωνιάτας ( I.Cret . iv 182 ( c. 165 )) or Απολλωνιάτας ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 37 ( c. 259 -250 )). The earliest reference to Apellonia as a polis in the political sense occurs in a C3magreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 37 ). Polybios provides the earliest reference to Apellonia as a polis in its urban sense (Polyb. 28 . 14 (r 171 / 0 )). Apellonia's unquestionable status as a polis during the Heltic period combined with the identification of a building at Ag. Pelagia (with phases in the Archaic period and in C4 -C3 ) as a prytaneion ( infra ) recommend the inclusion of Apellonia in the Inventory as a possible polis (type C) of the Archaic and Classical periods. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the C3m agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 37 ). For the individual use of the cityethnic there is Θαρσυφαtildeς Κρηgraveς Απολλώνιος , member of a theoria to Alexandria ( SEG 24 1175 ( 233 )). The territory of Apellonia is called ηasper Απελλωνία or ηasper χώρα ηasper τῶν Απελλωνιαταtildeν ( I.Cret . iv 181 ( c. 168 ), 182 ( c. 165 )). A large public building ( 15 m × 6 . 30 m) of C4 -C3 , oriented east-west, with two internal hearths, one at the east end and the other at the west, has been identifed as a prytaneion (Alexiou ( 1975 )). This building, which was destroyed in C2e, no doubt by the Kydonians (Polyb. 28 . 14 (r 171 / 0 )), overlies an Archaic (C6 ) structure with an eschara . The existence of a prytaneion at Apellonia in the Heltic period is indicated by the promise of state hospitality, presumably in the prytaneion , for visiting ambassadors, εξενοτροφήθεν δεgrave καιgrave οιasper πρειγευταταιgrave καθωgraveς καθέσταται ( I.Cret . i .iii. 1 (C3l)). The protecting deity of Apellonia was Apollo (Dekataphoros?) in whose sanctuary the public enactments of the polis were displayed ( I.Cret . i .iii. 1 (C3l)). The discovery at Ag. Pelagia of two Archaic bronze lebetes , one inscribed with a dedication to Apollo ( SEG 34913 ( c. 500 )), in a votive context may mark the location of this sanctuary (Karetsou ( 1978 ))."
947,Aptara (Aptaraios),Crete,35.25,24.1,1027,5355,"947 . Aptara (Aptaraios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 25 , long. 24 . 10 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: B.The toponym is Αacuteπταρα , ηasper ( SEG 41 731 (C3e)) or Αacuteπτερα , ηasper ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 113 ( c. 230 -220 )). The-city ethnic is Απταραῖος ( I.Cret . i .xxii. 4 A. 39 (C3f)) or Απτεραῖος ( I.Cret . ii .iii. 1 (C3l)). Both forms of the city-ethnic occur on the earliest coins (C4s/C3f; infra ). The literary sources use only the forms in ε - (Steph. Byz. 107 . 8 , 15 ; Polyb. 4 . 55 . 4 ). Bile (( 1988 ) 80 ) argues that the original forms were in ε -, but forms with ε - and with α -appear in the earliest sources. Pausanias refers indirectly to Aptara as a polis , presumably in the political sense, in his account of the Second Messenian War when the Aptaraioi sent archers to support the Lakedaimonioi (Paus. 4 . 19 . 4 , with 4 . 20 . 8 (rC7l)). The first certain reference to Aptara as a polis in the political sense, however, occurs in the alliance of Aptara with Eleutherna ( SEG 41 742 (C2e)). The earliest reference to Aptara as a polis in the topographical sense occurs in a C2f honorary decree ( I.Cret . ii .iii. 4 C). There is no proof that Aptara was a polis in the Classical period, but Pausanias' retrospective reference to the Apteraioi , the coins which may be as early as c. 330 ( infra ) and the public buildings of C5 and C4 ( infra ) recommend the inclusion of Aptara in the Inventory as a probable polis (type B). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the coins of C4s-C3f ( infra ). For the collective use externally there is Pausanias' reference to τοξόται Απτεραίων (Paus. 4 . 20 . 8 (rC7l)). For the individual use there is the proxenos of Olous, Αντίοχος Φιλτίδα Απταραῖος ( I.Cret . i .xxii. 4 A (C3f)). The territory is called ηasper Απτεραία χώρα (Ps.-Skylax 47 ). An honorary decree of C2m mentions harbours, εν τοῖς λι µ ένοις ( I.Cret . ii .iii. 4 C). One of these harbours was Kisamos (Strabo 10 . 4 . 13 ), perhaps to be identified with the ancient remains on the coast between Kalami, where an ancient mole has been identified, and Kalybes (Sanders ( 1982 ) 165 ( 17 / 1 )). Apart from the reference to τοξόται Απτεραίων in Pausanias' account of the Second Messenian War (Paus. 4 . 20 . 8 (rC7l)), evidence for the history and political institutions of Aptara dates no earlier than the Heltic period. The polis town of Aptara was located on a plateau (Palaiokastro, Megala Khoraphia, altitude 231 m) overlooking Suda Bay. Palaiokastro appears to have been continuously settled from C8 on (for a general description, see Blackman ( 1976 a ); for the settlement history, see AR 42 ( 1996 ) 47 ). Bronze Age a-pa-ta-wa (McArthur ( 1993 ) 127 -28 ) was perhaps located c. 6 km to the north at Stylos, where in addition to Bronze Age remains an important C7 building has been excavated ( KrEst 7 ( 1999 ) 175 -77 ). The Geometric, Classical and Heltic periods are represented in the cemetery,which was located outside the city wall in the saddle to the west, near the village of Megala Khoraphia (Drerup ( 1951 a ) 95 ; CretChron 12 ( 1958 ) 468 -69 ; KrEst 5 ( 1997 ) 208 ). City walls (date?) c. 4 km in length surround the entire plateau, enclosing an area of c. 63 ha. The several masonry styles (west: iso- or pseudo-isodomic; east: polygonal) may suggest several phases of construction (Drerup ( 1951 a ) 90 -92 ; Blackman ( 1976 a ); cf. Coutsinas ( 2001 ) 64 -66 ). The plateau was certainly fortified at the time of the Lyktian War (Polyb. 4 . 55 . 4 (r 221 -219 )). Possible traces of earlier walls have been noted at the eastern edge of the plateau (Blackman ( 1976 a )). A section of paved road running north-south has been excavated towards the centre of the plateau ( KrEst 5 ( 1997 ) 208 -11 ). Several cult sites have been identified in this same area: (i) a small temple with a double cella of the Classical period (Drerup ( 1951 b )); (ii) a Classical periobolos and small altar; (iii) a second Classical peribolos with a pyre and a large building (temple?) in an area which was in use from C8 ( KrEst 5 ( 1997 ) 208 -11 ). A Heltic inscription may refer to the prytaneion ( I.Cret. ii .iii. 2 (C2f), inferred from the invitation επιgrave ξένια . . . [ επιgrave τ ] αgraveν κοιναgraveν εasper [ στίαν ]). If so, in so far as the prytaneion is attested elsewhere on Crete during the Classical period (see Lato, infra ), it is possible that the one at Aptara was also pre-Heltic. The extent of the enclosed area indicates that not only the public buildings of the polis but also its residential districts were intra-mural. The protecting deity of Aptara was Artemis Aptara, whose sanctuary is attested epigraphically ( I.Cret. ii .iii. 2 (C2f)). Aptara struck coins (staters, hemidrachms) on the Aiginetan standard during the period c. 330 -280 / 270 (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 190 , 198 ). Types (stater): obv . head of a goddess (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 13 , Artemis Aptara?; Delepierre ( 1972 ), Aphrodite?); legend: ΑΠΤΑΡΑΙΩΝ or ΑΠΤΕΡΑΙΩΝ ; rev . warrior standing (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 13 , the hero Apteros?; Delepierre ( 1972 ), Aeneas?); legend: ΠΤΟΛΙΟΙΚΟΣ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. I. 7 , 9 -10 ); cf. ΠΤΟΛΙΟΙΤΟΣ (ibid. pl. I. 8 ). Types (hemidrachm): obv . head of a goddess as on staters; rev . bow; legend: ΑΠΤ ΑΡΑ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. I. 11 -12 ; SNG Cop.Aeg.Isl . 322 )."
948,Arkades (Arkas),Crete,35.05,25.2,697,3632,"948 . Arkades (Arkas) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 05 , long. 25 . 20 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: B. The toponym is Αρκάδες , οιasper ( I.Cret . iv 171 (C3m); BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 4 ( c. 230 -210 )); cf. Αρκαδία (Demetrios of Skepsis? apud Steph. Byz. 119 . 15 -16 ; Theophr. apud Sen. QNat . 3 . 11 . 5 ). The city-ethnic is Αρκάς (coins, C4s-C3f, infra ); I.Cret . iv 171 (C3m)). Seneca reports that according to Theophrastos, 'circa Arcadiam, quae urbs in Creta insula fuit, fontes et rivos substitisse' (Sen. QNat . 3 . 11 . 5 ). If Seneca's translation of Theophrastos is accurate, this is our earliest reference to Arkades as a polis . The use is either political or topographical qua asty . The earliest certain reference to Arkades as a polis occurs in the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 51 ( c. 259 -250 )), in which the Arkades are included as one of the πόλεις αι εγ Κρήτηι . The passage from Seneca and the coins of Arkades which may be as early as c. 330 ( infra ) strongly indicate that Arkades was a polis in the political sense in C4 . However, in so far as we cannot be certain whether Seneca was quoting rather than paraphrasing Theophrastos or whether the coins were struck in C4s, Arkades must remain a probable polis (type B). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the coins of C4s-C3f ( infra ) and externally in the C3m agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 51 ). For the individual use of the city-ethnic there are Τυχα µ ένης Ακουσίλας Αρκάς and Σώσα [ ρχο ] ς Αρήγ [ ο ] νος Αρκάς , immigrants from Arkades to Miletos ( Milet . i . 3 38 x 4 , 38 bb 5 (C3s)). Arkades was located to the south-west of Lasithi in the eparchy of Monofatsi, but the precise location of the polis town remains a subject of controversy. Levi suggested that the plural form of the name reflected the fact that the community was settled κω µ ηδόν , with its principal centre during the Geometric and Archaic periods at modern Aphrati (Levi ( 1927 -29 ) 15 -23 ), but this important early settlement is perhaps to be identified as the polis town of ancient Datala (Viviers ( 1994 ) 234 -41 ). The two inscriptions from Monofatsi which refer to Arkades by name ( I.Cret . i .v. 19 A, 20 A (both C2 )) were found in the vicinity of modern Ini, which is situated in the plain to the south-west of Aphrati.On current evidence Ini seems the most likely location for the polis town of Arkades, despite the fact that there is very little surface evidence of habitation before the Roman period (Sanders ( 1982 ) 151 ( 7 / 25 ); Viviers ( 1994 ) 233 -34 ). Theophrastos relates that Arkades had been destroyed and resettled,although the passage as quoted by Seneca provides no indication of the date of the destruction or resettlement apart from the floruit of Theophrastos himself (Theophr. apud Sen. QNat . 3 . 11 . 5 ). Otherwise, the evidence for the history and political institutions of Arkades dates to the Heltic period. Theophrastos mentions Arkades on account of her springs (Theophr. apud Sen. QNat . 3 . 11 . 5 ). A sanctuary of Asklepios, probably to be associated with these springs, and a festival, the Asklapieia, are attested epigraphically at Arkades (sanctuary: I.Cret . i .v. 52 (C3l); festival: IC iii .iii. 1 B (C3l)). Arkades struck coins (drachms) on the Aiginetan standard during the period c. 330 -270 . Types: obv . head of Zeus Ammon; rev . Athena standing and armed; legend: ΑΡΚΑ∆ΩΝ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. II. 16 -18 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 28 , 190 , 198 ; SNG Cop.Aeg.Isl. 345 )."
949,Aulon,Crete,35.05,25.0,346,1911,"949 . Aulon Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 05 , long. 25 . 00 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. The toponym is ΑΓaltλόν ( I.Cret . iv 64 (C5e)), Αυλών (Steph. Byz. 147 . 8 ). An ethnic is not attested. Stephanos is the only ancient source to call Aulon a polis , but he further identifies the toponym as a τόπος (ibid.). Guarducci suggests that Aulon was a suburb of Gortyn,in part because one likely location for the community is Ag. Deka, just 2 km east of the heart of the Roman city (Guarducci ( 1950 ) 30 -31 ). Others identify Aulon as a perioikic community of Gortyn (e.g. Larsen ( 1936 ) 16 ; Willetts ( 1955 ) 39 ; Nomima i 52 ). An early honorary decree ( I.Cret . iv 64 (C5e)) suggests that Aulon was a dependent polis of Gortyn, and so recommends the inclusion of Aulon in the Inventory as a possible polis (type C). The decree is enacted by Γόρτυνς επίπανσα and οιasper εν ΑΓaltλ ˜ ονι Γaltοικίοντες , the latter phrase presumably indicat- ing the political body, perhaps the assembly, empowered to make public decisions on behalf of the community. From the text we learn the following about the community at Aulon: (i) the community consisted of an 'urban' centre, a hinterland with recognised boundaries, and perhaps smaller settlements in the hinterland (Manganaro ( 1974 ) 54 -56 ); (ii) οι εν ΑΓaltλ ˜ ονι Γaltοικίοντες were responsible for the disposition of real property within their community; (iii) they enjoyed their own laws regarding its disposition; and (iv) they, like the citizens of the other υasperπόβοικοι (dependent poleis ) of Gortyn, were subject to judicial procedures pertaining to foreigners ( κσενεία δίκα ) in Gortyn. On the other hand, Gortyn was able to dispose of property within the community and to grant its public benefactor the right to sue as a Gortynian citizen subject there to the procedures of Γaltαστίαι δίκαι , suits pertaining to citizens (Perlman ( 1996 ) 266 -68 )."
950,Axos (Axios),Crete,35.2,24.5,1274,6444,"950 . Axos (Axios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 20 ; long. 24 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. Within Crete the toponym is either Γaltάξος ( I.Cret. ii .v. 20 B (C3l)) or Αacuteξος ( SEG 23 563 . 14 (C3 )). The city-ethnic is either Γaltάξιος (coins, C4 , infra ; I.Cret. ii .v. 17 (C3l)) or Αacuteξιος (coins, c. 330 -270 , infra ; SEG 23 563 . 3 (C3 )). Outside Crete the initial Γalt is frequently represented with the omikron , e.g. /acuteΟαξος , ηasper (Hdt. 4 . 154 . 3 ; BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 120 ( c. 230 -210 )) and ' Οάξιος ( IG ii² 9087 (C3 )), but forms with initial digamma ( Γaltάξιος , IG ix² . 1 6 . 11 (C3f)) and alpha ( Αacuteξιος , IG vii 3197 (C1e)) are also attested. Herodotos refers to Axos as a polis in the political sense in his narration of the foundation of Cyrene (Hdt. 4 . 154 . 1 (rC7l)). The earliest contemporary references to Axos as a polis occur in an early public enactment ( I.Cret. ii .v. 1 (C6 -C5 )). The term appears twice in the text, once in its political sense ( 6 -7 ) and once where its meaning is ambiguous ( 10 -11 ) and may be either political ('deposit with the polis ') or urban ('store in the polis '). For polis in the urban sense, see Ps.-Skylax 47 , where Oaxos is listed under the heading πόλεις πολλαιgrave εν Κρήτηsubiotaη . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally first on the coins of C4 ( infra ) and later in several C3 inscriptions (e.g. SEG 23 563 (C3s); I.Cret. ii .v. 20 B (C3l)). The collective use is first attested externally in C3 as well (e.g. I.Cret. iv 170 ). For the individual use there is the C3 grave stele from Athens of Θαρριάδης Φρονή µ ονος Κρηgraveς Οάξιος ( IG ii² 9087 ). Axos probably shared borders with Tylisos and Knosos to the east,with Gortyn to the south-east,and with Eleutherna to the west. One of the Archaic inscriptions from Axos has been identified as a treaty ( I.Cret. ii .v. 6 (C6 -C5 )). If so, this is one of the few Archaic treaties from Crete. The borders of Axos ( τοgraveνς τῶν Γaltαξίων ώρονς ) are mentioned in a description of the borders of Gortyn and Knosos ( I.Cret. iv 182 (C2f)). According to Herodotos, Axos was ruled by a βασιλευacuteς , Etearchos (Hdt. 4 . 154 -55 ). Etearchos was the maternal grandfather of Battos, the oikistes of Kyrene, and so his regnum -if historical-should be placed in C8s or C7f. This is the only attestation of a post-Minoan king on Crete. The inscriptions of Axos refer to the βολά ( I.Cret. ii .v. 9 (C6 -C5 )) and κόσ µ οι (e.g. I.Cret. ii .v. 6 (C6s), 9 (C6s); Bile ( 1988 ) 36 -37 . 27 (C6l); SEG 23 565 (C5 -C4 )). The board of κόσ µ οι appears to consist of three (or four?) members in a lex sacra of C4l ( SEG 23 566 . 11 -12 , with van Effenterre ( 1989 ) 6 ). The term αποκόσ µ ος (' kosmos elect' or 'exkosmos ') occurs in this same inscription ( SEG 23 566 . 14 ; Bile ( 1988 ) 274 ). The term δοκ ˜ εν occurs in one of the Archaic inscriptions ( I.Cret. ii .v. 1 . 2 (C6s)), and what is perhaps part of an enactment formula occurs in the lex sacra of C4l, καιgrave φυλαῖς Γaltα / δόν 'and (the following) decree pleased the tribes' ( SEG 23 566 . 12 -13 , with van Effenterre ( 1989 ) 6 -7 ); but the earliest fully preserved enactment formula is Heltic: έδοξεν Γaltαξίων τοῖς κόσ µ οις καιgrave ταtildeι πόλι ψαφιξα µ ένοις καταgrave τοgraveν νό µ ον ( I.Cret. ii .v. 17 (C3l)). Here πόλις refers to the assembly. The term εκκλησία occurs in this same inscription ( 6 ). The Archaic laws demonstrate that the polis had the authority to fine its magistrates ( I.Cret . ii .v. 9 (C6s)) and to grant individuals tax exemption and sustenance at public expense ( I.Cret . ii .v. 1 . 2 -3 , 14 -15 (C6s)). Free non-citizens, in this case citizens of another polis , may be indicated by the phrase χσένας ηgrave αστάς ('foreigners or citizens'), which occurs in an uncertain context in the lex sacra of C4l ( SEG 23 566 . 7 ). This same text preserves the terms φυλά and εasperταιρηία ( SEG 23 566 . 12 , 17 ). A Heltic inscription preserves part of the name of one of the tribes,[---] τιδαtildeν ( I.Cret. ii .v. 28 (C3l/C2e)). The name is clearly a patronymic, and as such is unparalleled elsewhere on Crete (Jones, POAG 223 ). The name of a second tribe or perhaps of another civic subdivision, Κυδαντεῖοι , occurs in an Archaic lex sacra ( I.Cret. ii .v. 9 (C6s); cf. Guarducci ( 1939 ) 57 , sive festum sunt sive gens ). The polis town occupied the hill above the modern village of Axos and extended north-east toward Livadhia. A residential district (Heltic) and a cemetery (some Archaic graves, but principally Heltic and Roman) lay to the south of the acropolis ( KrEst 4 ( 1991 -93 ) 266 -68 ). The undated acropolis fortifications appear not to have formed a complete circuit, but rather to have been built where the natural defences of the acropolis were inadequate (Taramelli ( 1899 ) 312 ). The masonry is polygonal. Two Archaic temples, one on the acropolis (Temple I) and a second below it to the east (Temple II), were excavated in 1899 (Levi ( 1930 -31 ) 44 -57 ). Some of the Archaic laws of Axos were probably inscribed on their walls (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 48 ; Jeffery ( 1949 -50 ) 34 -36 ). The protecting deity of Axos was probably Apollo, perhaps surnamed Axios (Hsch. Θ 614 : Θόαξος ), whose son the eponymous ancestor of the polis , Oaxos, was said to have been (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 42 -44 ). Temple I may have belonged to him (Perlman ( 2000 ) 73 ). Temple II has been attributed to Aphrodite on the basis of the votive figurine types (Levi ( 1930 -31 ) 50 ; Rizza ( 1967 -68 ) 291 -93 ). Other public buildings include a large cistern located on the acropolis to the north-west of Temple I (Levi ( 1930 -31 ) 48 ) and an andreion which is attested epigraphically ( I.Cret. ii .v. 1 (C6s), 25 (C4 -C3 )). Part of a residential district (Archaic?) was excavated south-west of Temple I (Levi ( 1930 -31 )). Axos struck coins (staters, drachms, hemidrachms, obols), on the Aiginetan standard during the period c. 380 / 370 -280 / 270 . Earlier coins ( c. 380 / 370 -330 ) have obv . head of Apollo; rev . tripod; legend (on some coins only): monogram Α or ΓaltΑΚΣΙΟΝ written retrograde in the epichoric alphabet (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. II. 30 -34 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 197 ). Later coins ( c. 330 -280 / 270 ) have obv . head of Apollo; rev . tripod; legend: ΓaltΑΞΙΩΝ or ΑΞΙΩΝ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pls. II. 38 , III. 1 -3 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 197 )."
951,Biannos (Biannios),Crete,35.05,25.25,540,2979,"951 . *Biannos (Biannios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 05 , long. 25 . 25 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: C. The city-ethnic is Βιάννιος ( I.Cret . i .vi. 1 (C3l), 2 (C2m); I.Cret . iv 179 ( c. 183 )). The toponym must have been the unattested * Βίαννος . Stephanos preserves the spelling Βίεννος (Steph. Byz. 168 . 16 ), perhaps in confusion with the Roman port of this name which was located on the south-west coast of Crete ( Stadiasmus 320 ). NoArchaic or Classical source calls *Biannos a polis . The earliest sources to do so are Heltic ( I.Cret . i .vi. 1 (C3l), 2 (C2m)). The term is used in its political sense in both inscriptions. In so far as *Biannos evidently was not a Heltic foundation, the evidence for its political status, albeit late, suggests that Biannos was a polis during the Classical period as well (for the possibility that Lyktos had absorbed *Biannos as it extended its territory south to the coast, see Viviers ( 1994 ) 255 -56 , whose argument largely depends upon taking the statement of Ps.-Skylax 47 , εν µ εσογείΩsubiotaα δεgrave Λυacuteκτος , καιgrave διήκει αυasperacuteτη α µ φοτέρωθεν , to mean 'reached to either coast (north and south)'). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in the asylia decree for Teos ( I.Cret . i .vi. 1 (C3l)) and in its renewal ( I.Cret . i .vi. 2 (C2m)), and externally in the alliance of *Biannos and the members of the Cretan koinon with Eumenes II ( I.Cret . iv 179 ( c. 183 )). The individual use of the city-ethnic is not attested. The name of the territory is α βιαννία ( I.Cret . iv 174 . 32 (C3l/C2e)). *Biannos probably shared a border with Hierapytna to the east ( I.Cret. iv 174 (C3l/C2e)). The polis town was located on a hill (Chorakia) immediately to the north-west of modern Vianno, where sherds of all periods from Orientalising through Roman have been reported (S. Hood et al . ( 1964 ) 83 ). A Heltic inscription refers to the prytaneion ( I.Cret. i .vi. 2 (C2m)). In so far as the prytaneion is attested elsewhere on Crete during the Classical period (see Lato, infra ), it is possible that also at *Biannos the prytaneion was pre-Heltic. The polis town of *Biannos was the closest urban centre to the important sanctuary of Hermes and Aphrodite at Symi, and communications between the sanctuary and the town were relatively easy. These topographic considerations suggest that the sanctuary was located within the territory of *Biannos, but there is no explicit evidence for this, and the inscriptions, especially the dedications,from Symi suggest that the sanctuary was in some sense 'pan-Cretan' (cf. Chaniotis ( 1988 ) 33 -34 ). The protecting deity of the polis was probably Ares, to whom the Biannioi offered a sacrifice called the εasperκατο µ φόνια (Steph. Byz. 168 . 19 -20 ) and in whose sanctuary the public enactments of the polis were displayed ( I.Cret. i .vi. 1 (C3l), 2 (C2m)). Coins struck by *Biannos are all Heltic (Guarducci ( 1935 ) 29 ; Svoronos ( 1890 ) 43 )."
952,Bionnos,Crete,35.1,24.3,343,1758,"952 . Bionnos Map. 60 . Lat. 35 . 10 , long. 24 . 30 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. The toponym is Βίωννος ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 13 ( c. 230 -210 )). The city-ethnic is not attested. Bionnos is listed between Psycheion and Matala in the catalogue of theorodokoi from Delphi ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 13 ( c. 230 -210 )). The toponym is perhaps to be identified with the remains of a fairly substantial settlement on the high ground (Pyrgos) and slope to the east (Kionia) above the sea 2 km south of the modern village of Kerame in Ag. Vasilios eparchy (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 310 ; Hood and Warren ( 1966 ) 173 -74 no. 8 ). The remains cover 1 . 5 ha and include a massive fortification wall with towers. Surface pottery is principally Classical and Heltic, with smaller amounts of Geometric and Archaic material (Hood and Warren ( 1966 ) 173 -74 ; Coutsinas ( 2001 ) 62 -63 ). No ancient source refers to Bionnos as a polis . However, the discovery at Pyrgi of a fragment of a C4l/C3e treaty ( I.Cret . ii .xxx. 1 ) suggests that Bionnos was perhaps a polis during the late Classical period. The appointment of a theorodokos c. 230 -210 to host the theoroi sent out from Delphi suggests the same for the Heltic period ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 13 ; Perlman ( 1995 b ) 128 -36 ). This evidence in combination with the observation that the settlement near Kerame was already established in the Classical period recommends the inclusion of Bionnos in the Inventory as a possible polis type C. The C4l/C3e text from Pyrgi outlines judicial procedures ( I.Cret . ii .xxx. 1 ). The δικαστήριον is mentioned, as are actions to collect debts ( πράξιν . [ ς ]), but the text is too fragmentary to draw any conclusions about the precise nature of the procedures described."
953,Chersonasos (Chersonasios),Crete,35.2,25.25,766,4053,"953 . *Chersonasos (Chersonasios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 20 , long. 25 . 25 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: B. The toponym Χερρόνησος is attested only in late literary sources (Xenion ( FGrHist 460 ) fr. 14 ; Strabo 10 . 4 . 14 ; Paus. 6 . 16 . 5 ). The local spelling of the toponym was probably Χερσόνασος (Guarducci ( 1935 ) 33 ). The city-ethnic is Χερσονάσιος (coins, C4s-C3e, infra ; IvO 276 (C4s); cf. Χερρονήσιος / Χερρονησῖται at Steph. Byz. 692 . 6 -7 ). The earliest reference to *Chersonasos as a polis occurs in the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 36 ( c. 259 -250 )). The term polis is used in its topographical sense qua totality of territory of *Chersonasos in a treaty (alliance?) between *Chersonasos and Rhodos ( SEG 41 768 (C3l)). The mint of *Chersonasos, which may have begun production as early as c. 330 ( infra ), and the individual use of the city-ethnic around the same time ( IvO 276 (C4s)) strongly suggest that *Chersonasos was a polis in the political sense by the late Classical period (Perlman ( 1996 ) 246 -52 ). Late authors refer to *Chersonasos as a πολισ µ άτιον ( Stadiasmus 349 ; Steph. Byz. 692 . 2 -3 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the coins of C4s-C3f ( infra ), and in Heltic treaties (e.g. SEG 41 768 (C3l)). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 36 ( c. 259 -250 )). For the individual use of the city-ethnic there is Φιλωνίδης Ζωιdieresisacuteτου Κρηgraveς Χερσονάσιος , hemerodromos and bematistes of Asia for Alexander ( IvO 276 (C4s)). The polis town of *Chersonasos was located to the south of a peninsula (Kastri) at the foot of what passes for an acropolis (Sanders ( 1982 ) 144 -46 ( 6 / 7 )). Remains there date no earlier than C4 , but two fragments of a C6 grave stele were discovered 1 km south of the port near the village of Koutoulophari at a place called Hellenika ( LSAG 316 no. 20 ). Little is known about the polis town of Chersonasos.A story preserved in Plutarch about the foundation of Lyktos suggests that the coastal region where the polis was located was called ηasper Χερρόνησος (Plut. Mor . 247 D).Viviers argues that *Chersonasos was in some sense a dependency of Lyktos already in C6 (Viviers ( 1994 ) 252 -54 ). If he is right, Lyktian control did not affect the political status of *Chersonasos, since it thereafter minted coins ( infra ) and joined in international agreements (e.g. Milet . i . 3 140 ( c. 259 -250 )), and its citizens were appointed proxenoi by other Cretan poleis ( I.Cret . iv 387 (C2 ); I.Cret. i .xix. 3 (C2 )). After its sympoliteia with Lyktos ( I.Cret . i .xix. 3 A ( c. 183 )), the two appear together (Lyktos and 'Lyktos by the sea') as signatories in interstate agreements ( SEG 41 770 (C2s); I.Cret. i .xviii. 9 A ( 111 / 10 )). For Strabo, *Chersonasos was the harbour of Lyktos: Λυacuteττου δεgrave . . . επίνειόν εστιν ηasper λεγο µ ένη Χερρόνησος (Strabo 10 . 4 . 14 ). Although attested in a Heltic alliance of Olous and Lyktos ( SEG 41 770 (C2l)), the tribal name ∆ίφυλοι is likely to be early, and so is mentioned here. Strabo mentions a sanctuary of Britomartis at Cherronesos (Strabo 10 . 14 ), and this goddess (or Artemis-Britomartis), if not the protecting deity of the polis , surely enjoyed a state cult there (coin types). *Chersonasos struck two series of staters on the Aiginetan standard during the period c. 330 -280 / 270 (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 197 ). Type 1 : obv . head of a goddess (Svoronos ( 1890 ) 49 , Artemis; Guarducci ( 1935 ) 34 , Britomartis); rev . Apollo kitharoidos seated upon the omphalos , or Herakles striking with uplifed club; legend: ΧΕΡΣΟ written retrograde in the epichoric alphabet, or ΧΕΡΣΟΝΑΣΙΟΝ / ΧΕΡΣΟΝΑΣΙΩΝ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. III. 17 -26 ; SNG Cop.Aeg.Isl. 360 ). Type 2 : obv . head of Zeus; rev . Artemis standing drawing an arrow, or seated; legend: ΧΕΡ (Le Rider ( 1966 ) pl. XXXIV. 13 -15 )."
954,Datala (Datales),Crete,,,1189,6562,"954 . Datala (Datales) Map 60 . Unlocated. Type: A. The toponym is not fully preserved in any ancient source. It has been restored ∆αττ [ άλλα ] ( I.Cret . i .xvi. 5 , l. 64 (C2l)), but is written ∆ΗΤΑΛΛΑ in a facsimile edition of a lost copy of this treaty which was reported to have come from Kydonia (Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 367 no. 61 . 142 ). This same spelling has been restored ∆ητ [ άλ ( λ ) α ] in an Archaic law from Lyktos ( SEG 35 991 B 4 (C6 )). The city-ethnic was written ∆αταλές (nom. sing.) ( Prakt ( 1973 ) 191 (C6 )), ∆αταλευtildeσι (dat. pl.) ( SEG 27 631 (C6l)). These latter two inscriptions are likely to have been written in the dialect of Datala and so preserve the correct spelling without consonantal gemination. Datala was located somewhere in north central Crete between Knosos and Lato, but the precise location remains unknown. Map 60 locates Datala in the Lasithi plain at Pinakiano (Ag. Giorgios Papoura). Viviers ( 1994 ) subsequently identified Datala with the remains of the substantial early settlement at Aphrati (Prophitis Elias). Viviers' case is a strong one, but on present evidence certainty is not possible. The term polis occurs in the enactment formula of the Spensithios decree, Θιοί · έΓaltαδε ∆αταλευtildeσι καιgrave εσπένσα µ ες πόλις ( SEG 27 631 (C6l)). Scholarly opinion remains divided as to whether (i) the Dataleis and the polis should be identified; (ii) the Dataleis represent a sub-unit of the polis , in which case the name of the polis is not known; or (iii) the Dataleis represent an altogether distinct community from the unnamed polis (Viviers ( 1994 )). The first alternative, viz . the polis is Datala, is adopted here. The term is used in its political sense both in the enactment formula quoted above and in the phrase ποινικάζεν καιgrave µ να µ ονευtildeΓaltεν πόλι . Independent of the Spensithios decree, the identification of Datala as a polis in the political sense is supported by the individual use of the ethnic in the artist's signature ∆α µ όθετος εποεσ ' ο ∆αταλές ( Prakt ( 1973 ) 191 (C6 ); Perlman ( 1996 ) 246 -52 ). The collective use occurs in the Spensithios decree ( SEG 27 631 (C6l)). During the Archaic period Datala perhaps shared a border with Lyktos ( SEG 35 991 B 4 (C6 ); van Effenterre and van Effenterre ( 1985 ) 182 -83 ). The polis of Datala disappears from the record following C6 . It seems likely that the community was absorbed by a more powerful neighbour (Viviers ( 1994 )). In C2 the topoynm was apparently still in use to designate an area at the border of Lato and Lyktos, [ κης τ ] αgraveν ∆αττ [ άλλαν ] ( I.Cret . i .xvi. 5 , l. 64 ; van Effenterre ( 1973 ) 35 -37 ). Perhaps α ∆αττάλλα was the name of the territory of the polis during the Archaic period. The Spensithios decree ( SEG 27 631 (C6l)) provides a good deal of information about the public institutions of Datala, but each detail has proved to be controversial (for a review of the scholarly interpretations of this text, see Nomima i 22 ). The enactment formula of the decree ( έΓaltαδε ∆αταλευtildeσι καιgrave εσπένσα µ ες πόλις . . . αποgrave πυλαtildeν πέντε απ ' εκάστας ) indicates that the assembly, identified by both the collective city-ethnic ∆αταλευtildeσι and the term πόλις , perhaps together with a council consisting of five individuals from each of the phylai ( αποgrave πυλαtildeν πέντε απ ' εκάστας ), were responsible for ratifying the public enactments of the community. The κόσ µ ος was apparently the chief official at Datala. He (or they, if the singular κόσ µ ος is here used for a board) enjoyed unspecified procedural rights at law ( δίκα ), which henceforth the ποινικαστάς was to share. The ποινικαστάς served as 'recorder' and 'remembrancer' for the polis , πόλι ποινικάζεν καιgrave µ να µ ονευtildeΓaltην , and was responsible for performing δα µ όσια θυacute µ ατα if there was no priest.The authority of the polis was clearly recognised in several areas. Affairs of state, ταgrave δα µ όσια , included both sacred and secular matters. The polis was authorised to award individuals ατέλεια , and so, presumably, could impose and collect taxes, and judicial immunity ( απλοπία ), and was able to guarantee protection against bodily seizure ( µ ήδ ' επάγραν . . . µ ήδε ' ρυacuteτιον ). Finally, the citizens (presumably) of Datala belonged to ανδρηία , to which they were required to contribute food. If the identification of Datala with the settlement at Aphrati (Prophitis Ilias) is correct, more may be said about the organisation of the polis . At the summit of the acropolis, fortifications with towers enclosed a small area, roughly trapezoidal in shape, supplied with water from a cistern (Levi ( 1927 -29 ) 32 -37 ). Excavations conducted by the Greek Archaeological Service (A. Lebessi) in 1968 and 1969 uncovered on the south-eastern slope of the acropolis what was in C7 a large one-room building ( 12 m × 6 . 8 m) with benches along its interior walls. A scatter of C6material attests the continued use of the area in the Archaic period. The building is probably to be identified as a temple ( ArchDelt 24 ( 1969 ) Chron . 415 -18 ; ArchDelt 25 ( 1970 ) Chron . 455 -60 ; cf. Viviers ( 1994 ) 244 -49 : andreion or bouleuterion ). Residential districts were situated on the protected eastern slopes of the acropolis (Levi ( 1927 -29 ) 38 -57 ), where Lebessi uncovered a building complex (domestic?) of C6 -C5 with a closed deposit of c. 425 -400 ( ArchDelt 25 ( 1970 ) Chron . 458 -60 ). Geometric and Orientalising cemeteries were located on the upper western slopes of Prophitis Ilias (Levi ( 1927 -29 ) 78 -400 ; for a sarcophagus of C6from 'Orthi Petres' , see ArchDelt 30 ( 1975 ) Chron . 341 -42 ). The settlement may have been abandoned for much of C4 (Erickson ( 2000 ) 361 -62 ). A magistral dedication from Aphrati indicates that the κόσ µ οι served as the eponymous officials for the community ( I.Cret. i .v. 4 (C5 )). The dedication is to Athena, and the inference may be drawn that the goddess enjoyed a state cult there. The alternative candidate for the site of Datala, Pinakiano (Ag. Giorgios Papoura), is located to the north of Lasithi on a ridge 70 m above the plain (Watrous ( 1982 ) 39 -40 ). Evidence for habitation dates from the Protogeometric through the Archaic period, when it was the largest settlement in this area. Remains of C5 and C4 (votive terracotta plaques and black glazed pottery) are concentrated on the south-east slope of the ridge and perhaps attest a shrine which survived the abandonment of the settlement."
955,Dragmos (Dragmios),Crete,35.1,26.1,436,2283,"955 . Dragmos (Dragmios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 10 , long. 26 . 10 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. The toponym is ∆ράγ µ ος (Xenion ( FGrHist 460 ) fr. 4 ). The city-ethnic is ∆ράγ µ ιος ( I.Cret . iii .iv. 9 , lines 58 , 68 (rC3f); I.Cret . iii .iv. 10 , l. 12 (C2l)). The only source to identify Dragmos as a polis is Steph. Byz. 238 . 6 quoting Xenion for the toponym (( FGrHist 460 ) fr. 4 ). It is uncertain whether the site-classification polis stems from Xenion's work. Dragmos possessed a territory ( χώρα ) and shared a border with Itanos which was defined in a treaty between the two communities. The border with Itanos followed the course of the river Sedamnos (modern Kokhlakies?, which empties into Karumes Bay about 5 km south of Palaikastro) ( I.Cret . iii .iv. 9 , 59 -61 (rC3f); Faure ( 1963 ) 18 ). In so far as there is very little evidence on Crete for the existence of territorial sub-units of the polis ( komai vel sim. ), the fact that Dragmos had both a territory and borders and that it entered into a treaty in C3f demonstrates that the community was a polis in the political sense in the early Heltic period. The location of the polis town of Dragmos is not known. Map 60 identifies the polis town of Dragmos with the remains of a fortified settlement on Koutsoulopetres (Kastri). Visible remains include sherds from the Geometric through Heltic periods, fortification walls with towers, house walls, cisterns and tombs ( BCH 79 ( 1955 ) Chron . 307 -9 ; Faure ( 1963 ) 18 ; cf. Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 184 , who prefers Epano Zakro on the grounds that Koutsoulopetres is too far north). If this identification is correct, the record of the settlement during the earlier periods suggests that Dragmos may already have been a polis in the political sense by the late Classical period. On the strength of this evidence, Dragmos is included in the Inventory as a possible polis (type C). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested in the arbitration of Magnesia for Itanos and Hierapytna ( I.Cret . iii .iv. 9 , ll. 58 , 68 (rC3f)); the use is probably external. Praisos absorbed Dragmos ( I.Cret . iii .iv. 9 , ll. 61 -65 ). The date of the absorption of Dragmos by Praisos has as its terminus post quem perhaps the period 270 -260 (Perlman ( 1995 a ) 165 )."
956,Dreros (Drerios),Crete,35.15,25.4,1468,7254,"956 . Dreros (Drerios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 15 , long. 25 . 40 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym ∆ρηtildeρος appears only in the grammarian Hdn. iii . 1 190 . 19 . The city-ethnic is ∆ρήριος ( BCH 60 ( 1936 ) 280 -85 (C4 /C3 )). The earliest references to Dreros as a polis in the political sense occur in the enactment formulas of two Archaic laws ( έΓaltαδε πόλι , SEG 27 620 = ML 2 . 1 (C7m), Nomima i 81 (C7m); πόλι έΓaltαδε , BCH 70 ( 1946 ) 590 -97 no. 2 (C7l) = Nomima i 64 ). For a possible Archaic use there is the 'public record of the ancient Drerian land'( υasperπό µ να µ α ταtildeς ∆ρηρίας χώρας ταtildeς αρχαίας ), which refers to the enmity of the Milatioi towards ταtildeι πόλει ταtildeι τῶν ∆ρηρίων ( I.Cret . i .ix. 1 , ll. 147 -48 ; for the date of the υasperπό µ να µ α , see Nomima i 48 (C6l); cf. Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 200 ( c. 220 )). The term is perhaps used in the sense of polis town in the phrase κοι ίκαδι οι ταtildeς πόλιος , 'the 20 of the city' ( Nomima i 81 (C7m)). The collective use of the city-ethnic occurs internally in the υasperπό µ να µ α quoted above ( I.Cret . i .ix.i, ll. 147 -48 (C6l or c. 220 )), and externally in the agreement between Knosos and Miletos which Dreros co-signed ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 38 ( c. 259 -250 )). For the individual use of the city-ethnic there is the immigrant from Dreros to Miletos, Ευacuteξιππο [ ς Μ ] άκ [ ρ ] ιδος ∆ρήριος ( Milet . i . 3 38 p 4 (C3s)). One of the υasperπο µ νά µ ατα of Dreros refers to the territory, χώρα , contested by Dreros and Milatos, her neighbour to the west ( I.Cret . i .ix.i, ll. 149 -52 ). The term πυλά occurs in the enactment formula of an Archaic law, πόλι έΓaltαδε διαλήσασι πυλαtildeσι ( BCH 70 ( 1946 ) 590 -97 no. 2 (C7l) = Nomima i 64 ): 'the polis decided after consultation with the phylai ' or 'the polis decided after dismissing the phylai ' (for the derivation of the term διαλήσασι (pl. part.?) from * είλλω / ίλλω , see van Effenterre ( 1946 ) 592 ). The names of two phylai are preserved in the dating formulas of public enactments: ∆υ µ αtildeνες ( BCH 60 ( 1936 ) 280 -85 (C4 /C3 )); Αιθαλεῖς ( BCH 61 ( 1937 ) 29 -32 (C4 /C3 ); I.Cret . i .ix. 1 , ll. 3 -9 ( c. 220 )). The eponymous κόσ µ οι were organised by phylai . One of the υasperπο µ νά µ ατα of Dreros mentions the citizen αγέλαι ( I.Cret. i .ix. 1 , l. 154 (C6l or c. 220 )), while the Heltic civic oath mentions the εταιρεῖαι ( I.Cret . i .ix. 1 , ll. 124 , 135 ( c. 220 )). Both may be attested as well in an Archaic law ( SEG 23 530 (C7l); but cf. Nomima ii 89 ). An adult male citizen population of c. 7 , 000 for C3 Dreros has been suggested on the basis of the 180 αγέλαοι πανάζωστοι who swore the civic oath ( I.Cret . i .ix. 1 , ll. 10 -14 (C3l); Marinatos ( 1936 ); cf. Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 199 : the 180 is a representative group only, and so is of little use in estimating the size of the population). The public enactments of Dreros were ratified by the πόλις ( SEG 27 620 (C7m); BCH 70 ( 1946 ) 590 -97 no. 2 (C7l)). Whether πόλις in this context refers to the political community or to the assembly cannot be determined. The term δαtilde µ ος is used for the assembly in the enactment formula of a Heltic proxeny decree ( BCH 60 ( 1936 ) 280 -85 (C4 /C3 )). The κόσ µ οι appear to have been the chief officials of the Archaic polis and to have exercised both executive and judicial authority ( SEG 27 620 (C7m)).The board of κόσ µ οι consisted of five members plus the γρα µµ ατευacuteς in a public enactment of c. 220 ( I.Cret. i .ix. 1 ). Whatever the precise motive for the enactment of SEG 27 620 (fear of tyranny, demands on the part of the élite for equal representation, experience of judicial misconduct), the interest of the polis in controlling the authority of the κόσ µ οι is demonstrated by the harsh penalties, including atimia for life, which the polis imposed upon κόσ µ οι who disregarded the law. For other laws of C7 , see SEG 23 530 ; BCH 70 ( 1946 ) 590 -97 no. 2 , 600 -2 no. 4 . During the Heltic period, and no doubt earlier as well, one member of the board of κόσ µ οι served as the eponymous magistrate for the polis ( BCH 60 ( 1936 ) 280 -85 ). In addition to the κόσ µ οι , the Archaic laws of Dreros preserve four terms which may denote public officials: (i) δά µ ιοι ( SEG 27 620 (C7m)), comptrollers (Ehrenberg ( 1943 ) 14 ), or citizen landowners (van Effenterre ( 1985 ) 394 -96 ); (ii) οι ίκατι οι ταtildeς πόλιος , the twenty of the city ( SEG 27 620 (C7m)),a council perhaps of the men of the city who were eligible to serve as κόσ µ ος ( Nomima i 81 : 'dirigeants politiques de l'acropole'); (iii) τοῖς ιθυνταtilde [ σι ], 'les redresseurs' ( Nomima i 27 ( c. 575 ); cf. Bile ( 1988 ) 359 n. 124 : τοῖσι θυσταtildeσι (priests)); and (iv) ο αγρέτας , assembler ( BCH 70 ( 1946 ) 590 -97 no. 2 ), either a political official who convened the assembly or a military officer who called out the troops (van Effenterre ( 1946 ) 590 -97 ). The council ( βουλά ) is not attested before the Heltic period ( BCH 60 ( 1936 ) 280 -85 (C4 /C3 )). The polis townof Dreros occupied a double acropolis and the connecting saddle. There were two circuit walls built in part of polygonal masonry; one protected the entire polis town (two peaks and the saddle), an area of c. 28 ha, and a second the acropolis proper, viz . Ag. Antonios, the eastern summit (Marinatos ( 1936 ) 217 -19 ; Demargne and van Effenterre ( 1937 ) 7 ). An altar and four cisterns were located on the summit of the Ag. Antonios (Marinatos ( 1936 ) 216 ; Demargne and van Effenterre ( 1937 ) 7 ).A large public building ( 24 m × 10 m), probably a temple, was excavated on the western summit (Xanthoudides ( 1918 ) 23 -28 ; cf. Marinatos ( 1936 ) 254 : the building is an andreion ). Residential areas occupied the northern (and southern?) slopes of both acropolises (Xanthoudides ( 1918 ) 28 -29 ; Marinatos ( 1936 ) 216 -17 ). The public centre (agora with plateia and theatral steps, cistern, temple of Apollo Delphinios, and possibly prytaneion ) was located in the saddle (for the temple, see Marinatos ( 1936 ) 219 -83 ; cf. Mazarakis Ainian ( 1997 ) 217 -18 : the temple was not free-standing but part of a building complex; for the agora, see Demargne and van Effenterre ( 1937 ) 10 -32 ). The Archaic laws of Dreros were probably inscribed on the east wall of the temple, and would have been visible from the plateia and theatral steps below and to the east of the temple terrace. It has been suggested that these steps were used for meetings of a political institution (Hansen and Fischer-Hansen ( 1994 ) 62 ). The terracing and construction of the theatral steps of the agora and the construction of the temple appear to be contemporary (C8f: Demargne and van Effenterre ( 1937 ); cf. van Effenterre ( 1992 a ): the plataia and theatral steps were laid out in C6 ). The cistern was built c. 220 (Demargne and van Effenterre ( 1937 ) 27 -32 ; Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 195 -201 ) and the ' prytaneion ' during C4s/C3f (Demargne and van Effenterre ( 1937 ) 15 -18 ). A subMycenaean Geometric cemetery was located to the northeast of the acropolis (van Effenterre ( 1948 a ) esp. 15 -22 ). Apollo Delphinios was probably the protecting deity of the polis ."
957,Eleutherna (Eleuthernaios),Crete,35.2,24.4,1998,10349,"957 . Eleutherna (Eleuthernaios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 20 , long. 24 . 40 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: A. The toponym is ' Ελευθέρνα , ηasper ( IG ix² . 1 17 , ll. 87 -88 (C3f)); cf. ' Ελευθέννα ( SEG 41 742 (C2f)); ' Ελουθέρνα ( I.Cret . ii .xii. 22 (C3s)). Ps.Skylax 47 gives the plural ' Ελευθέρναι , αιasper . Stephanos identifies several toponyms as early names of Eleutherna: Απολλωνία (Steph. Byz. 106 . 13 -14 ), Αacuteωρος ( 154 . 3 -5 ), Σάτρα ( 557 . 16 ), Σάωρος ( 265 . 11 -12 ). There is no further evidence for Apollonia as an early name of Eleutherna. Αacuteωρος , Σάτρα and Σάωρος may all derive ultimately from the toponym preserved in Apollo's cult title Σασθραῖος ( SEG 41 743 (C3e); van Effenterre ( 1991 b ) 28 ). The cityethnic is ' Ελευθερναῖος (coins, C4s-C3f, infra ; I.Cret . ii .xii. 20 (C3s)); cf. ' Ελευθενναῖος (coins, C4s-C3f, infra ; SEG 41 741 (C3m)), ' Ελουθερναῖος ( I.Cret . ii .xii. 22 (C3l)). The earliest evidence for ρν - is the legend ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡ on the C4m coins ( infra ). Later inscriptions and coins from Eleutherna suggest no pattern in the use of the assimilated versus unassimilated form of the group ρν - (cf. Bile ( 1988 ) 121 -22 , which appeared before the publication of SEG 41 739 -55 ). The earliest attestations of the term πόλις in connection with Eleutherna occur in uncertain contexts in two Archaic laws ( I.Cret . ii .xii. 14 a, with κόσ µ ος in the following line; I.Cret . ii .xii. 16 Ab (both C6l)), but the earliest certain refer- ence to Eleutherna as a polis in the political sense occurs in the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 38 ( c. 259 -250 )), in which the Eleuthernaioi are included as one of the πόλεις αι εγ Κρήτηι . The term πόλις is paired with απα µ ία in I.Cret . ii .xii. 16 Ab, µ ηgrave ιν απα µ ίαι µ [ ή ] δ ' ιν πόλι , 'neither in the apamia nor in the polis ' . The term απα µ ία seems to refer to land in the chora , in which case πόλις here is used in the urban sense ( Nomima i 26 ; cf. Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 19 -20 : private land cultivated by serfs). For polis in the urban sense, see also Ps.-Skylax 47 , where Eleuthernai is listed under the heading πόλεις εν Κρήτηι . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the coins of C4m-C3f ( infra ), and externally in the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet 1 . 3 140 . 1 , 38 ( c. 259 -250 )). For the individual use of the city-ethnic, there is the proxeny decree of Gortyn for Κυacuteρτος Ανδροσκυacuteλω ' Ελευθενναῖος ( I.Cret . iv 206 F (C3 /C2 )). AnArchaic law regulating the consumption of wine mentions symposiastic consumption on ∆ῖον άκρον ( SEG 41 739 (C6l)). The toponym refers to a cape on the north coast of Crete between Pantomatrion and Heraklion (Ptol. Geog. 3 . 15 . 5 (from west to east): Cape Lianos, Chondros, Korakias or Bali) which perhaps marked the eastern border of Eleutherna with Axos (van Effenterre ( 1991 c ) 18 -20 ). Wherever its exact location, this inscription indicates that the territory of the Archaic polis extended to the north coast. The inland asty is likely to have been served by one or more harbours on the north coast. A coastal settlement (Archaic and later) has been identified at Stavromenos, 11 km east of Rhethymnon (S. Hood et al . ( 1964 ) 62 -66 ; Schiering ( 1982 ) 17 -47 ). Coins with the legend ΠΑ ( rev .) found (in some quantity?) there suggest that this might be ancient Παντο µ άτριον (Faure ( 1993 ) 72 ). The relatively large number of coins of Eleutherna found there indicate that it was frequented by Eleuthernians, and that it perhaps served as a port for the polis (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 252 -54 ). Whether the settlement at Stavromenos was part of the polis of Eleutherna during the Archaic period cannot be determined. The πολιτήια of the Artemitai ( I.Cret . ii .xii. 22 (C3l)) may represent either a territorial civic subdivision of Eleutherna (Perlman ( 1996 ) 252 -54 ) or a dependent community of Eleutherna (Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 402 -6 : non-citizens, possibly freedmen, settled near a sanctuary of Artemis). The term δρο µ ευacuteς , perhaps referring to citizens of the younger age-grades who enjoyed limited citizen rights, appears in the Archaic law concerning the consumption of wine ( SEG 41 740 ; Tzifopoulos ( 1998 ) 150 -69 ). The compound αλλοπολιάτας , partially restored in an Archaic law ( I.Cret . ii .xii. 3 (C6l)), has been understood to refer to resident aliens (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 148 ) or to expatriates of Eleutherna (van Effenterre and van Effenterre ( 1985 ) 187 -88 ; Nomima i 10 ). The partly preserved [---] τ ˜ ο κσεν [---] ( I.Cret. ii .xii. 4 ) most likely refers to foreigners or to officials or laws pertaining to foreigners.This same text may preserve a reference to δαtilde µ ος or δα µ όσιος ( vel sim. ) in line 1 ([---] µ ηδεgrave δα [ µ ] οσ . [---] or [---] µ ηδεgrave δαtilde [ µ ] ος . [---]). The term απα µ ία ( I.Cret. ii .xii. 16 Ab, l. 2 ), a category of land holding, implies that the community of Eleutherna identified certain of its members as αφα µ ιῶται , a term attested in literary sources (largely lexicographical), where it is defined as a Cretan term for an individual of dependent status (Athenaeus VI 263 f; Hsch. s.v.; Strabo 15 . 1 . 34 ). The kosmate is attested in what is perhaps a reference to the eponymous kosmoi of the current or of a previous year ( I.Cret . ii .xii. 9 , l. 3 ): [---κ ] αιgrave Τί µ αρκος εκόσ µ ιον '[in the year when ο δεῖνος ] and Timarchos were kosmoi '). From this we may deduce that the kosmate was eponymous and was organised as a board (for the kosmate, see also I.Cret . ii .xii. 14 (C6l); I.Cret . ii .xii. 20 -22 (C3 )). The Archaic laws preserve the terms µ ολ ˜ εν 'to bring an action' ( I.Cret. ii .xii. 15 a + b), δικάζοντας 'adjudicate' ( I.Cret . ii .xii. 11 ), and ποινικά [ ζοντας ] 'record (in writing)' (ibid.). Two of the laws refer to witnesses or to the act of testifying: [---µ ] αιτυρ [---] ( I.Cret. ii .xii. 8 ); [---µ ] αιτυρα µ ένο or [--µ ] αίτυρα µ εgraveν ο ( I.Cret. ii .xii. 13 ). Others refer to oaths: the act of taking an oath ( κόρκον τιθέ µ εν , I.Cret. ii .xii. 3 ), denial by oath ( εκ &lt; σ &gt; ο µ νυacuteηι , SEG 23 571 ; απο µ [---]?, I.Cret. ii .xii. 17 ), and perhaps to the oath curse ([--τ ˜ οι δεgrave όρκ ] οι ταgraveν αραgraveν ινή µ ε [ ν ],'the curse shall be included in the oath' , I.Cret . ii .xii. 3 ). Two of the laws guarantee immunity from prosecution: άπατον / απάτος ή µ εν ( I.Cret . ii .xii. 3 , 11 ). The only early documentary evidence for the foreign relations of Eleutherna is the reference to a θιαρός in an Archaic law ( I.Cret. ii .xii. 11 (C6l), with Nomima i 14 ). All other evidence for the foreign relations of Eleutherna dates to the Heltic period. The presence of pottery from Corinth (C7s-C6f), Lakonia and Argos (C6 ), Attika (from C6l), Gortyn (C7 -C4 ), Knosos (C6 -C5 ), and possibly Kydonia and Aphrati (C6 ) attests to Eleutherna's participation in intra-island and Mediterranean trading networks,but is not sufficient to demonstrate direct relations with any one of these places (Erickson ( 2000 ) 237 -56 ). Zeus Polioachos was worshipped by the polis ( SEG 41 744 (C2s); coins, infra ), but it is not clear that Zeus was the protecting deity of Eleutherna (for the cults of Eleutherna, see Stavrianopoulou ( 1991 ), with Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 190 -95 ). The polis town of ancient Eleutherna was built on two neighbouring ridges: Pyrgi to the east (perhaps called Sasthra in Antiquity: van Effenterre ( 1991 b ) 28 ) and Nisi to the west (perhaps called Wilkon in Antiquity: ibid. 28 -30 ). Pyrgi appears to have been the centre of the early settlement. Remains there include the Geometric-Classical cemetery at the western foot of Pyrgi and two (or perhaps three) sanctuaries. Another sanctuary was located on southern Nisi. During the Classical period a large peribolos ( 35 m × 50 m) with a Doric pentastyle propylon was built on Nisi in the location of the earlier sanctuary.Its function remains uncertain. Van Effenterre identifies the peribolos as the sanctuary of Apollo Wilkonios and the meeting place of the Cretan koinon (van Effenterre ( 1991 b ) 28 -30 ). Fortifications of uncertain date are identified on Nisi to the north of the Classical peribolos and enclosing a Heltic residential district further to the north, and on the summit of Pyrgi to the south of Heltic buildings. A terminus ante quem for the fortifications of 221 / 0 is provided by Polyb. 4 . 55 . 4 . For an overview of the settlement history of the polis town of Eleutherna, see Kalpaxis ( 1994 ) with plan 1 ; for the Geometric-Classical cemetery, see Stampolidis ( 1993 ); Erickson ( 2000 ) 156 -228 ; for plans of the Classical peribolos on Nisi and the Heltic buildings on Pyrgi which show the provenance of SEG 41 739 -55 , see Kalpaxis ( 1991 ); for the Heltic residential district on northern Nisi,see Kalpaxis et al . ( 1994 ). The term 'stater'occurs in two inscriptions of C6l ( SEG 2 12 . 13 , 23 571 ). If the term refers to coinage rather than to a unit of weight, these inscriptions provide some of the earliest evidence for the use of coins on Crete. If so, the term most likely refers to Aiginetan staters. Eleutherna's proximity to Kydonia, whence Aiginetan coinage is likely to have been introduced into the island during the final quarter of C6 (Stefanakis ( 1999 )), makes this an attractive possibility. Eleutherna began to strike her own coins (staters) on the Aiginetan standard c. 350 (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 197 ). Types: obv . Apollo holding a stone and a bow, with a dog and flanked by two trees (Svoronos ( 1890 ) 130 , styrax trees?); rev . Artemis the huntress; legend: ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡ written retrograde in the epichoric alphabet (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XI. 4 ). Later coins (staters, drachms, hemidrachms, c. 330 -280 / 270 ) have obv . head of Apollo or head of Zeus; rev . Apollo standing; legend: ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΝΑΙΟΝ or ΕΛΕΥΘΕΝΝΑΙΟΝ and abbreviations down to ΕΛΕΥ , some retrograde (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pls. XI. 5 -6 , 9 -11 , 14 -17 , 22 , 24 , 27 -39 ; XII. 1 -2 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 197 ; SNG Cop.Aeg.Isl . 429 ). Obols of this period have obv . head of Apollo; rev . Apollo standing or E or E ^ in monogram (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XI. 12 -13 , 18 -20 , 25 )."
958,Eltynia (Eltynieus),Crete,35.15,25.1,547,2781,"958 . *Eltynia (Eltynieus) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 15 , long. 25 . 10 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is not attested, but must have been *Eltynia. The city-ethnic is ' Ελτυνιευacuteς ( I.Cret . i .x. 2 (C5e), ' Ελτυνιουtildeσι ( I.Cret . iv 206 G (C3 /C2 ); Milet . i . 3 140 . 36 ( c. 259 -250 )). For the early use on Crete of -ου - for ευ -, see Bile ( 1988 ) 111 -12 . Cf. also / Ελτυναιεῖς ( I.Cret . iv 179 ( c. 183 )). In the Heltic period the form ' Ελτυacuteνιος occurs in inscriptions from sites outside the island ( SB 5273 (C3f); I.Magnesia 21 (C2e)). The earliest reference to Eltynia as a polis in the political sense occurs in a law concerning damages for personal injury which requires that fines be paid ες πόλιν ( I.Cret . i .x. 2 (C5e)). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in the law concerning personal injury ( I.Cret . i .x. 2 (C5e)), and externally in the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 36 ( c. 259 -250 )). For the individual use of the city-ethnic, there is the proxeny decree of Gortyn for Πόλλος Φαιστιόννα ' Ελτυνιευacuteς ( I.Cret . iv 206 G (C3 /C2 )). The chief public official of Eltynia appears to have been the κόσ µ ος (or board of κόσ µ οι ), who served both executive ( πραδεgraveν ταgraveν ες πόλιν τι µ άν , 'exact the fine for the polis ') and judicial ( γ [ ι ] γνόσκεν ο µ νυacuteντας , 'decide having sworn the oath') functions ( I.Cret . i .x. 2 (C5e)). The board perhaps consisted of just two members ( κόσ µ ον . . . ότερον , I.Cret . i .x. 2 , l. 3 , with Bile ( 1997 ) 116 ). Line 2 of this same text probably preserves part of an enactment formula: [ θίοι · τάδ ' έΓaltαδε ] τοῖς ' Ελτυνιουtildeσι . If so, τοῖς ' Ελτυνιουtildeσι in this context refers to the assembly. The terms πηιdieresisacuteσκος and αγέλαος occur in the law concerning bodily injury ( I.Cret . ii .x. 2 (C5e)) and refer to age-grades ('child' and 'youth' respectively) of the citizen class of the polis . Almost nothing is known archaeologically about Eltynia apart from the chance discovery of the membra disiecta (capital and wall blocks including the one bearing I.Cret. i .x. 2 ) of an Archaic? Doric temple (Xanthoudides ( 1920 ) 75 -81 ). Four terms, probably referring to public areas in the polis town, occur in a provision of the law concerning personal injury,which details where the injury takes place (ibid. ll. 6 -7 (C5e)): (i) ανδρήιον ; (ii) αγέλα ; (iii) συνβολήτρα , place where contracts are made (Bile ( 1988 ) 179 ) or 'combat zone' or refectory ( Nomima ii 80 ); (iv) κορός , agora (Bile ( 1988 ) 344 n. 84 ) or dance floor ( Nomima ii 80 ). Certainly the ανδρήιον was defined architecturally. Whether or not the others were cannot be determined."
959,Elyros (Elyrios),Crete,35.15,23.5,777,3940,"959 . Elyros (Elyrios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 15 , long. 23 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is /acuteΕλυρος (Ps.-Skylax 47 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ελυacuteριος (coins, C4s-C3f, see infra ; I.Cret . iv 185 (C3l/C2e)). There is one example each of the toponym and the city-ethnic spelled with initial iota (see Bile ( 1988 ) 86 n. 45 ): εν ' Ιλυacuteρωι ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 106 ( c. 230 -210 )); ' Ιλυρίοις ( SEG 9 2 . 54 ; cf. SEG 42 1663 (C4s)). The earliest reference to Elyros as a polis occurs in Ps.Skylax 47 , who uses the term in its urban sense. The term is used in its political sense in the enactment formulas of Heltic proxeny decrees (e.g. I.Cret . ii .xiii. 1 (C3 /C2 )). There is little doubt that Elyros was a polis in the political sense in the late Classical period. The evidence for this is: (i) inclusion among the poleis given grain by Cyrene in the 320 s ( SEG 9 2 ); (ii) participation in the C4l federation of the Oreioi ( infra ); and (iii) striking coins as early as c. 330 ( infra ). Grave stelai of C5 /C4 indicate that the polis townwas already settled during the Classical period ( CretChron 9 ( 1955 ) Chron . 569 ; Ergon 1964 ( 1965 ) Chron . 150 -51 ). It would seem probable,then,that Elyros was already a polis in the political sense by the end of the Classical period. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the coins ( infra ) and externally in the list of recipients of grain from Kyrene during the grain crisis of the 320 s ( SEG 9 2 ). For the individual use of the city-ethnic there is Σηρίων ∆εξίω ' Ελυacuteριος ( SEG 45 1315 (Heltic)) from Lisos. The terrritory of Elyros is called α τῶν ' Ελυρίων χώρα ( I.Cret . iv 185 ( c. 200 -189 )). Stephanos identifies Souïa as the harbour ( επίνειον ) of Elyros (Steph. Byz. 590 . 8 ). This may mean nothing more than that Souïa was the most convenient harbour for Elyros (Perlman ( 1995 b ) 132 -34 ); but some level of co-operation between the two communities is suggested by the aqueduct (date?) which brought water from a source near the village of Livadha to Elyros ( c. 4 . 5 km to the south-east) and thence to Souïa (Savignoni and de Sanctis ( 1901 ) 424 ). Elyros was a member of the C4l-C3federation οιasper /acuteΟρειοι (van Effenterre ( 1948 a ) 119 -27 ; Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 106 -8 , 421 -22 ; cf. Sekunda ( 2000 ) 337 -38 : league founded C3f). Elyros is little known archaeologically, although there is no question that it was settled already in C5 if not earlier (see e.g. Baldwin Bowsky ( 1997 ) for C5l atticising grave stelai from Elyros). Cf. Barr . HRL only. The hill on which the polis town was built was protected by a circuit wall approximately 3 km long. The summit of the hill was perhaps fortified with a second defence wall, and so may be regarded as the acropolis proper (Pashley ( 1837 ) ii. 104 -9 ). Early travellers report the remains of a theatre (Savignoni and de Sanctis ( 1901 ) 424 ) and a temple (Pashley ( 1837 ) ii. 104 -9 ) near the church of the Panaghia. There is no reason to identify this temple as that of Apollo (cf. Pashley ( 1837 ) ii. 104 -9 ), although Elyros did maintain particularly close ties with Delphi,appointing theorodokoi at home to entertain the theoroi sent out from Delphi ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 106 ( c. 230 -210 )) and a theorodokos at Delphi to entertain her own theoria to the festival there ( I.Cret. ii .xiii. 1 A (C3 /C2 )). Pausanias describes a bronze goat dedicated by the Elyrioi to Apollo at Delphi (Paus. 10 . 16 . 5 ). The story which Pausanias tells concerning this dedication suggests that the mythic founders of Elyros were the twin sons of Apollo and the nymph Akakallis, Philandros and Philakides (Frost ( 1996 )).

960,Gorty(n)s (Gortynios),Crete,35.05,24.55,4299,22703,"960 . Gorty(n)s (Gortynios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 05 , long. 24 . 55 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Γόρτυ ( ν ) ς ( Γόρτυνς , I.Cret. iv 64 (C5e), coins, C5m, infra ; Γόρτυς , Il . 2 . 646 ) or Γόρτυνα (Ps.-Skylax 47 ). Bile suggests that of the two inflections (theme in ν and theme in α ), the theme in α perhaps originated from the accusative of the theme in -ν (Bile ( 1988 ) 201 -2 ). The city-ethnic is Γορτυacuteνιος ( I.Cret. iv 23 (C6s); coins, C5m, infra ; Simon. Anth. Pal. 7 . 254 bis (C6 /C5 )). Gortyn is called a polis in a fragment of an Archaic law, [---] | πόλι πάνσαι πρά [---] ( I.Cret . iv 13 e 2 (C7l)), where the use is probably political ( Nomima i 1 ). The earliest certain instances of the use of πόλις in the political sense occur in the enactment formula of an early decree: έδοκαν α πόλις ( I.Cret . iv 43 Ba 3 (C5e)) and in a provision of a law of the same period which requires that fines be paid 'to the polis ' ( I.Cret iv 78 (C5e)). For similar clauses in slightly later laws, see e.g. I.Cret . iv 41 .iii. 16 -17 (C5f), I.Cret . iv 79 (C5m). Cf. also the law concerning mortuary practices, εν Γaltίδαι α πόλις θυacuteωνται ( I.Cret . iv 146 (C5s-C4e)). Polis in the urban sense occurs in two provisions in the Gortyn Law Code which distinguish houses located in the polis from those in the chora ( I.Cret . iv 72 .iv. 31 -33 , viii. 1 -2 (C5m)). For polis in the urban sense,see also Ps.-Skylax 47 , where Gortyn is listed under the heading πόλεις πολλαιgrave εν Κρήτηsubiotaη . The broader topographical use of polis to mean the totality of territory occurs in two laws, the later perhaps a reformulation of the earlier, which concern wages paid to non-citizens (metics and slaves) who live in the polis . In both examples, the relevant clauses are restored τοῖς ε µ πόλι Γaltοικίονσι τοῖς τ ' ελευθέροις καιgrave τοῖς δόλοις ( I.Cret . iv 79 (C5m), 144 (C5s/C4e)). The collective use of the city-ethnic is first attested internally in an Archaic law ( I.Cret . iv 23 (C6s)) and externally in a late Classical inscription ( SEG 9 2 . 33 (C4s)) and in Ephor. fr. 149 ). For the individual use of the city-ethnic, there are the early epitaphs of the merchant Βρόταρχος Γορτυacuteνιος Κρής (Simon. Anth. Pal. 7 . 254 bis (C6 /C5 )) and the copper smelter Σωσῖνος Γορτυacuteνιος ( IG i³ 1349 bis (C5s)), and the reference to the proxenos of Athens, Νικίας Γορτυacuteνιος Κρής (Thuc. 2 . 85 . 5 ). Little is known about the organisation of the polis town during the Archaic and Classical periods (for an overview, see Perlman ( 2000 )). The inhabitants of three Geometric settlements,Ag.Ioannis,Prophitis Ilias and Charkià Pervoli, appear to have abandoned their hill-top villages around 700 , most likely to resettle ( καταgrave κώ µ ας or in a single settlement?) at the foot of the ridge of hills which marks the northern edge of the Mesara (Allegro ( 1991 ); Di Vita ( 1991 ); La Torre ( 1988 -89 ); Perlman ( 2000 )). This resettlement probably marks an important step in the formation of the polis of Gortyn. Ag. Ioannis ( 275 m) probably served as the acropolis. In C7f ( c. 675 -650 ) an open-air sanctuary on the acropolis was monumentalised by the construction of a temple, perhaps in part open-air (Scrinari ( 1968 ) 23 -56 ). The form of the cella (tripartite?) has been understood to imply that the temple originally belonged to three deities, but votive figurine types indicate that by the Classical period the temple belonged to Athena (Rizza ( 1968 ) 191 -93 , 249 -50 ), who is called Poliouchos in Heltic documents ( I.Cret. iv 171 (C3 ), 183 ( c. C3l/C2e)). Archaeological exploration of Gortyn has to date yielded few other traces of the Archaic and Classical polis town. The most significant of these remains are the following. (i) The temple of Apollo Pythios (C7s) built on the plain 700 m south-east of the foot of the acropolis (Ricciardi ( 1986 -87 )), within which one or two generations after the construction of the Pythion (C7l-C6e), the Gortynians began to inscribe their laws upon its walls ( I.Cret. iv 1 -27 , 29 -38 , 40 ; Perlman ( 2002 )). (ii) The Gortyn Law Code ( I.Cret. iv 72 (C5m)) was inscribed boustrophedon in columns on the inner face of the walls of a curved structure whose blocks were reused in the Roman Odeion located below Ag. Ioannis on the east bank of the river Metropolianos. (iii) A second group of similarly inscribed blocks ( I.Cret. iv 41 -49 , 51 (C5f)) was reused in a rectangular structure of the Heltic period (Guarducci ( 1950 ) 87 -90 ). This Heltic building, parts of which were incorporated into the Odeion, has been interpreted as a bouleuterion (Meinel ( 1980 ) 597 ). Halbherr identified some Geometric material beneath the Odeion and traces of Archaic walls, perhaps belonging to a stoa, to its south-west (Pernier ( 1925 -26 )). It is assumed that the buildings on which the Great and Second Codes were inscribed were located in the same vicinity; but to date no suitable foundations have been found (Halbherr ( 1887 ); cf. Di Vita in Blackman ( 1997 ) 104 ). (iv) A third group of blocks bearing inscriptions dating to C5f were reused in the walls of the early Byzantine church at Mavropapas, located 200 m south-west of the Pythion. These blocks probably belong to a late Archaic building located in the vicinity of, if not directly under, the church (Halbherr ( 1897 ) 170 -219 ; Perlman ( 2000 ) 61 -62 : blocks came from a public building associated with the εσπράτται 'collectors of fines'?). (v) A sanctuary (C6l) was established about 700 m north-east of the Pythion (Di Vita ( 1984 ) 71 : a sanctuary of Demeter and Kore?). Several public buildings (or open-air meeting places) are attested in early inscriptions: (i) agora ( I.Cret. iv 43 Bb (C6e); I.Cret. iv 80 (C5e); I.Cret. iv 72 .vii. 11 , x. 35 -36 , xi. 10 -14 (C5m); I.Cret. iv 75 A, 81 (C5m); for the location of the agora in the vicinity of the later Roman Odeion, see Perlman ( 2000 ) 72 -73 ); (ii) αγρηtildeιον ( I.Cret. iv 9 a-b (C7l); Guarducci ( 1950 ) 32 , 55 : where the army assembled?; Koerner ( 1993 ) 367 : where homicide trials took place?); (iii) δικαστέριον ( I.Cret. iv 72 .xi. 15 -16 (C5m);Guarducci ( 1950 ) 169 : building used by the δικασταί in the agora? [or the institution?, ed.]). A stretch of wall contemporary with the early phases of the settlement on Ag. Ioannis ( c. 1190 -970 ) has been identified as a defence wall (Hom. Il. 2 . 646 : Γόρτυς τειχιόεσσα ; Rizza and Scrinari ( 1968 ) 21 -22 ; cf. Hayden ( 1988 ) 12 -13 ), but Strabo's claim that the polis was unfortified until Ptolemy (IV) paid for the construction of a circuit wall is supported archaeologically (Strabo 10 . 4 . 11 ; Allegro and Ricciardi ( 1988 )). Two toponyms, Aulon and Latosion, have been identified as suburbs of the polis town of Gortyn. For Aulon, see supra no. 949 . Guarducci suggests that Latosion supra 1146 was located in the vicinity of the modern village of Mitropolis, 1 km west of Gortyn, and that it was a district of the polis town where metics and freedmen were allowed to reside (Guarducci ( 1950 ) 181 ; Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 162 -63 ; cf. van Effenterre and van Effenterre ( 1985 ) 187 -88 ). The name of the territory was ηasper Γορτυνία (Strabo 10 . 4 . 7 ). There is no evidence for territorial subdivisions, but Gortyn may have controlled dependent poleis from as early as C5e ( infra ), whose citizens were called υasperπόβοικοι (Perlman ( 1996 ) 239 -42 ). For settlement patterns in the Mesara during the first millennium, see La Torre ( 1988 -89 ); Sanders ( 1976 ); Simpson et al . ( 1995 ); Watrous et al . ( 1993 ). Gortyn's neighbour to the west was Phaistos. The two poleis were joined together in a sympoliteia during the period C5m-C4m (coins, infra ; Cucuzza ( 1997 )) and again in the Heltic period ( I.Cret. iv 165 ; SEG 23 563 (both C3s); Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 104 -8 , 422 -28 ). Amykalion, a dependent community ( polis ?) of Gortyn ( I.Cret. iv 172 (C3l); Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 399 ; cf. Perlman ( 1996 ) 260 -61 ), was probably located in the vicinity of modern Kommos (Cucuzza ( 1997 ) 66 -72 ). If so, it would appear that Gortyn had extended her influence, if not her control, to the western Mesara by C5m ( I.Cret. iv 72 .iii. 5 -9 (C5m)).Mt.Ida formed the border of Gortyn to the north-west. Gortyn may have controlled the cave sanctuary of Zeus on Mt. Ida in the Classical period ( I.Cret. iv 80 (C5e), 146 (C4f)). Patela Prinias commanded the principal north-south route east of Mt. Ida. The Archaic community there appears to have been abandoned c. 550 (Rizza ( 1991 )), perhaps a victim of Gortynian expansion to the north. Henceforth, Patela Prinias occupied the frontier between Gortyn and her northern neighbour(s). One of these neighbours was Rhaukos (modern Ag. Myron?). Gortyn and Knosos destroyed Rhaukos (C2m) and divided her territory between themselves. Thereafter they shared a border which appears to have cut through what had been the polis town of Rhaukos (Polyb. 30 . 23 . 1 ; I.Cret. IV 182 (C2m)). Pyranthos and Rhytion were perhaps dependent poleis located within the territory of Gortyn at the eastern edge of the Mesara (for Pyranthos, see Perlman ( 1996 ) 241 , 268 -70 ; for Rhytion, see ibid. 241 , 256 -57 , 268 -70 ). Further east were the poleis Arkades and Priansos. A Heltic alliance of Gortyn and Hierapytna with Priansos describes the Heltic border of Priansos and Gortyn ( I.Cret. iv 174 (C3l)). Several small communities were located at the southern edge of the Mesara. The evidence for two of these, Boibe and Pyloros, is not sufficient to draw any conclusions concerning their political status (for Boibe, see Perlman ( 1996 ) 261 -62 , 268 -70 ; for Pyloros, see ibid. 262 , 269 ). *Rhitten may have been located in the southern Mesara (no. 988 ). The largely uninhabited Asterousia mountains separated the Mesara from several small communities located on the south coast of Crete (Faure ( 1965 ) 37 -40 ). They are (from east to west) Einatos, the harbour of Priansos (no. 985 ); Lebena (no. 972 ); Lassoia (see supra ); and Matala (no. 976 ). The toponyms Keskora and Pala occur together in a Gortynian decree concerning the lease of public lands located ε [ ν ] Κεσκόραι καιgrave ε µ Πάλαι ( I.Cret. iv 43 Ba (C5e)). Keskora and Pala were probably located in the Mesara,but nothing further about them is known (Perlman ( 1996 ) 242 -43 ). The terms πολιάτας ('citizen') and πολιατευacuteειν ('to exercise the rights of a citizen') occur in the early laws of Gortyn ( πολιάτας , I.Cret. iv 72 .x. 35 -36 , xi. 14 (C5m); πολιατευacuteειν , I.Cret. iv 51 (C5f); I.Cret. iv 72 .ix. 31 -33 (C5m); cf. Lévy ( 1997 ) 26 : 's'il exerce effectivement ses droits de citoyen' , that is, 's'il est présent dans le pays'). Three other terms are associated with the status of citizen: (i) ελευacuteθερος (e.g. I.Cret. iv 72 .i. 1 -7 (C5m)) 'citizen' (Lévy ( 1997 ) 26 -30 ) or 'potential citizen' (Bile ( 1988 ) 343 ); (ii) δρο µ ευacuteς (e.g. I.Cret. iv 72 .v. 40 -42 ), new citizen who enjoys limited citizen rights (Tzifopoulos ( 1998 ) 150 -69 ); (iii) Γaltαστία ( δίκα ) ( I.Cret. iv 64 (C5e)), legal procedures for citizens. Male citizens belonged to hetaireiai ( I.Cret . iv 42 B. 11 -14 (C5f), 72 .x. 37 -39 ; cf. απέταιρος , infra ). The only civic subdivision attested is the phyle ( πυλά ) ( I.Cret. iv 19 , 104 (C7 /C6 ); I.Cret. iv 72 .vii. 40 -viii. 36 (C5m)). The Gortynian phylai appear to have been personal rather than territorial organisations (Jones, POAG 224 -25 ). The names of seven phylai are attested in the dating formulas of public texts (decrees, magistral dedications, manumissions): (i) Αιθαλεῖς or Αιθελεῖς ( I.Cret . iv 72 .v. 5 (C5m); I.Cret. iv 142 (C5m/C4e)); (ii) Αινάωνες ( I.Cret. iv 196 (C2f)); (iii) Απ [. . .] υ µ α [---] ( I.Cret. iv 236 (C4s/C3f)); (iv) Αχρήια ( I.Cret. iv 186 B + 187 (C3l/C2e)); (v) Αυτοληtildeται ( I.Cret. iv 261 (C2s/C1f)); (vi) ∆εκ [---] ( I.Cret. iv 171 (C3f)); (vii) ∆υ µ αtildeνες ( I.Cret. iv 197 (C2f)). Marriage within the phyle was recommended when possible ( I.Cret. iv 72 .vii. 40 -viii. 36 (C5m); cf. Morris ( 1990 )). The σταρτός , attested in the Gortyn Law Code ( I.Cret. iv 72 .v. 5 (C5m)) and in the treaty of Gortyn and *Rhitten ( I.Cret. iv 80 (C5e)), may represent a sub-unit of the phyle , perhaps the γένος (Willetts ( 1955 ) 111 -13 ; cf. Guarducci ( 1950 ) 159 , 185 ; Jones, POAG 225 -26 ; Nomima i 7 ). Terms for various categories of free non-citizens or that attest the presence of free non-citizens in the polis include (i) κσένιος / κσήνιος ( κόσ µ ος ) ( I.Cret. iv 14 g-p. 1 -2 (C6 ), 30 (C6 ), 78 (C5e), 72 .xi. 16 -17 (C5m)), official responsible for foreigners; κσενείαι δίκαι ( I.Cret. iv 80 (C5e)), suits pertaining to foreigners; (iii) υπόβοικος ( I.Cret. i .xvi. 1 (C3l)), citizen of a dependent polis of Gortyn (Perlman ( 1996 ) 239 -42 ); (iv) απέταιρος ( I.Cret. iv 72 .ii. 5 (C5m), 84 (C5 )), a free man denied citizen status-bastard, disenfranchised citizen vel sim . (Willetts ( 1967 ) 103 -9 ; Lévy ( 1997 ) 26 -28 ); (v) απελευacute [ θερο ---] ( I.Cret. iv 78 (C5e)), manumitted slave (Guarducci ( 1950 ) 181 ; Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 162 -63 ; cf. van Effenterre and van Effenterre ( 1985 ) 187 -88 ; Nomima i 16 : απελευ [ σα µ ένον ---] vel sim . ('expatriate')). The terms δ ˜ ολος and Γaltοικευacuteς / Γaltοικέα (e.g. I.Cret. iv 72 passim ) designate categories of the unfree (Lévy ( 1997 ) 30 -40 ). The public enactments of Gortyn use the collective cityethnic οιasper Γορτυacuteνιοι (e.g. θιοί . τάδ ´ έΓaltαδε τοῖς Γορτυνίοις πσαπίδονσ [ ι ], I.Cret . iv 78 (C5e)) and the term πόλις (e.g. [ τάδ ´ έΓaltαδ ] ε ταtildeι πόλ [ ι ψαφίδδονσι or ψαφίξανσι ], I.Cret . iv 378 C (C3 )) to refer to the assembly. The legislative function of the assembly is attested first in C5e: τάδ ' έΓaltαδε τοῖς Γορτυνίοις πσαπίδονσ [ ι ] ( I.Cret . iv 78 ). The term πλεθυacuteς may refer to the assembly in an early law or decree ( I.Cret . iv 87 (C5m); Nomima i 97 ). A quasi-judicial role as corporate witness is suggested by the requirement that both adoptions and the renunciation of adoptions be declared in the agora when the citizens are assembled, καταΓaltελ µ ένον τ ˜ ο µ πολιαταtildeν ( I.Cret . iv 72 .x. 35 , xi. 14 (C5m)). The boule is not securely attested at Gortyn. ΕΣΒΟΛΑΝ occurs in an Archaic law and has been interpreted as either ες βολάν ('to the council) or εκβολή ('ejectment, divorce') ( I.Cret . iv 23 . 4 (C6l); Bile ( 1988 ) 156 n. 356 ). One member of the annual board of κόσ µ οι (also /Koppaόσ µ ος / κόρ µ ος ) was eponymous (e.g. I.Cret. iv 72 .v. 6 (C5m), 142 (C5m/C4e), 236 (C4s/C3f)). The size of the board of κόσ µ οι is not known (cf. I.Cret. iv 259 (C2f): ten κόσ µ οι plus a ιasperαροργός ). The kosmate was organised by tribe ( I.Cret. iv72 .v. 6 (C5m), 236 (C4s/C3f)).An Archaic law on iteration restricted service to once every three years ( I.Cret. iv 14 g-p (C6 )). There is no reason to conclude that the κσένιος κόσ µ ος (' kosmos for non-citizens') was a member of the board of κόσ µ οι ( I.Cret. iv 14 g-p (C6 ), 30 (C5e), 78 (C5e), 79 (C5m)). Iteration was restricted to once every five years ( I.Cret. iv 14 g-p 2 (C6 )), and a special 'recorder' , the µ νά µ ον ο τ ˜ ο κσενίο , was attached to the office ( I.Cret. iv 72 .xi. 6 -23 (C5m)). Other public officials attested in the early inscriptions from Gortyn include (i) τίτας ( I.Cret. iv 15 a-b (C7l), 14 g-p (C6 ), 78 (C5e), 79 (C5m)),'magistrate who fines'or 'comptroller'(Bile ( 1988 ) 327 ). The term occurs in the plural in two inscriptions ( I.Cret. iv 78 (C5e), 79 (C5m)). They were chiefly responsible for the collection of fines assessed by the polis against private individuals ( I.Cret. iv 78 (C5e)) and officials ( I.Cret. iv 79 (C5m)). (ii) γνό µ ον , 'supervisor' vel sim . ( Nomima i 82 ) or 'councillor' (Bile ( 1988 ) 339 ). Iteration was restricted to once every ten years ( I.Cret. iv 14 g-p (C6 )). (iii) εσπράτται ( I.Cret. iv 75 D (C5m), 87 (C5m), 91 (C5m)), 'collectors of fines' . The term is associated with the verb πράζω , 'to pay' (Bile ( 1988 ) 327 ; Nomima i 97 ), and occurs only in the plural in conjunction with δικασταί . They seem to have been responsible primarily for the collection of fines assessed in judicial proceedings. A special µ νά µ ον τ ˜ ον εσπρατταtildeν was attached to the office ( I.Cret. iv 87 (C5m)). (iv) ο επόττας ( I.Cret. iv 84 (C5 )),'overseer'?,'inspector'? (Guarducci ( 1950 ) 193 ). The function of this official is not known (Bile ( 1988 ) 331 n. 54 : fiduciary official?). (v) καρποδαῖσται ( I.Cret. iv 77 (C5e)) were probably responsible for the collection and redistribution of produce tithed for the syssitia (Guarducci ( 1950 ) 179 ; Willetts ( 1967 ); Bile ( 1988 ) 323 ; Nomima i 49 ). (vi) πρείγιστος . The term occurs in two agreements of Gortyn and dependent communities: ( 1 ) for the dependent polis of *Rhitten ( I.Cret. iv 80 (C5e)) and ( 2 ) for 'those living on Kaudos'( I.Cret. iv 184 + SEG 23 589 (C3l/C2e)); for the political status of this community, see Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 411 -17 ). This suggests that the Gortynian πρείγιστος was an official involved in the administration of dependent communities (cf. Guarducci ( 1950 ) 186 -87 ; Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 419 -20 ). (vii) σταρταγέτας ( I.Cret. iv 80 (C5e)), 'leader of the startos ' ( supra ) or military commander? (Guarducci ( 1950 ) 185 ). (viii) δικαστάς . The term does not occur in the earliest laws of Gortyn (see Perlman ( 2001 ) 197 ), but is common in the inscriptions of C5 ( I.Cret. iv 41 (C5f), 42 B (C5f), 45 (C5f), 72 passim (C5m), 76 (C5m), 106 (C5m)). An unknown number of δικασταί , at least some of whom enjoyed specialised duties, served the polis (e.g. the δικαστάς for the hetaireiai and for cases concerning security deposits ( I.Cret. iv 42 B (C5f)); the ορπανοδικασταί ( I.Cret. iv 72 .xii. 6 -19 (C5m)); cf. µ ολ ˜ εν οπ ˜ ε κ ' επιβάλλει , παgraveρ τ ˜ οι δικασταtildeι /tilde ε Γaltεκάστο έγρατται ( I.Cret. iv 72 .vi. 25 -31 , ix. 18 -24 (C5m)). The simple term always occurs in the singular (cf. the compound ορπανοδικασταί , I.Cret. iv 72 .xii. 6 -19 (C5m)),and it seems likely that all cases were heard by a single δικαστάς . The δικαστάς either 'applied the law' , δικάζειν (e.g. I.Cret. iv 72 .iii. 5 -9 , v. 28 -39 , ix. 43 -54 (C5m)),or 'determined the facts under oath' , ο µ νυacuteντα κρίνεν (e.g. I.Cret. iv 42 B (C5f), 72 .ix. 24 -40 , xi. 46 -55 (C5m)).Both procedures are described in a law from the Gortyn Law Code ( I.Cret. iv 72 .xi. 26 -31 (C5m)). A µ νά µ ον sometimes assisted the δικαστάς when he 'applied the law' . Decisions of the δικαστάς could not be appealed. Nothing is known about the qualifications, appointment, tenure or pay of the δικασταί . Citizenship may not have been a requirement for the µ νά µ ον ( I.Cret. iv 72 .ix. 24 -40 (C5m);cf.Lévy ( 1997 ) 26 ). For the δικαστάς , see in general Willetts ( 1967 ) 127 -34 ; Bile ( 1988 ) 348 -51 . The legendary founder of Gortyn was Γόρτυς , the son of either Tegeates according to the Tegeans or Rhadamanthys according to the Cretans (Paus. 8 . 53 . 4 -5 ). Conon preserved a tradition that in the third generation after the conquest of Amyklai by Sparta (C8e), the Spartans Pollis and Delphos led a group of Imbrian and Lemnian immigrants from Lakonian Amyklai to Gortyn, where they settled together with some Cretan perioikoi (Conon ( FGrHist 26 ) fr. 1 .xxxvi; Malkin ( 1994 ) 111 -13 ). An early association with Sparta is suggested as well by the tradition concerning the Gortynian poet and lawgiver Thaletas, who taught Lykourgos and resided in Sparta for some time (Paus. 1 . 14 . 4 ; doubted by Arist. Pol. 2 . 9 , 1274 a 25 -31 ). Plato's Cretan, Kleinias, however, identifed the Gortynians as Argive in origin (Pl. Leg. 4 . 708 A; Bürchner ( 1912 ) 1667 ). For the ethnic composition of the early polis , see Perlman ( 2000 ). The early inscriptions of Gortyn tell us very little about its foreign relations. According to Strabo, Gortyn and Lyktos temporarily superseded Knosos as the foremost cities of Crete (Strabo 10 . 4 . 7 ). If Strabo's account is historical, a likely time for the emergence of Gortyn as a leading power on the island is C6 -C5 (Hood and Smyth ( 1981 ) 18 -19 ). During the Archaic and Classical periods Gortyn may have formulated agreements with four poleis whose territories bordered the Mesara: (i) with Lebena ( I.Cret. iv 63 (C6l/C5e)); (ii) with the dependent polis *Rhitten ( I.Cret. iv 80 (C5e)); (iii) a sympoliteia or alliance with Phaistos (coins, infra ); (iv) a sympoliteia or alliance with Sybrita? (coins, infra ). For aspects of Gortyn's consolidation of the Mesara, see Perlman ( 1996 ) 258 -70 ; Cucuzza ( 1997 ). The Cretan polis Polichne, located west of Kydonia (at Vryses?), may have been an ally of Gortyn. In 429 the Gortynian Νικίας , proxenos of Athens, contriving to support Polichne, arranged for an Athenian naval squadron to attack Kydonia (Thuc. 2 . 85 ; Figueira ( 1988 ) 538 -42 ; cf. Sekunda ( 2000 ) 327 -37 : Polichnitai was the name of a federation of small nonDorian communities in west Crete). During the grain crisis of the 320 s, Gortyn received 10 , 000 medimnoi of grain from Kyrene ( SEG 9 2 ). Gortyn struck coins on the Aiginetan standard from c. 470 (Price ( 1981 )). Types on the earliest staters (C5f-C4m) attest a sympoliteia or alliance with Phaistos (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 161 ). Types: obv . Europa riding the bull, facing r.; rev . lion's scalp (Le Rider ( 1966 ) pl. XI. 8 -19 ). The beginning of local coinage at Gortyn (staters and drachms with same types as above) is indicated by the legend ( rev .) ΓΟΡΤΥΝΟΣΤΟΠΑΙΜΑ ( Γόρτυνος τοgrave παῖ µ α ) written retrograde in the epichoric alphabet (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XII. 21 , 28 ) and somewhat later ΓΟΡΤΥΝΙΟΝ (Le Rider ( 1966 ) pl. XI. 11 -13 ). The earliest drachms, hemidrachms and obols have obv . recumbent bull; rev . lion's scalp; legend (drachm obv .): ΓΟΡΤΥΝΣ written retrograde in the epichoric alphabet (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XII. 27 -33 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl . 439 ). Staters of C4s ( c. 360 / 350 -300 ) have obv . female figure (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 14 n. 1 , Europa or Britomartis?) seated in a tree; rev . standing bull; legend: ΓΟΡΤΥΝΙΟΝ , sometimes retrograde in the epichoric alphabet (Le Rider ( 1966 ) pls. XI. 20 -XVIII. 18 ). Drachms and obols of this period (C4s) have: obv . head of a bull; rev . head of Europa? (Le Rider ( 1966 ) pls. XIX. 11 -26 , XX. 13 -14 ). Sybrita minted coins with the same types in C4s and may have been joined with Gortyn in a sympoliteia or alliance (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 160 -62 ). SNG Cop.Aeg.Isl. 438 -45 ."

The toponym is ' Ηράκλειον , τό (Strabo 10 . 4 . 7 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ηρακλειώτας ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 37 ( c. 259 -250 ); SB 4272 (C3f)). The earliest reference to Herakleion as a polis in the political sense occurs in a C3m agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εν Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 37 ). The Stadiasmus 348 refers to Herakleion as a polis in the urban sense, ' Ηράκλειον . . . πόλις εστίν . έχει λι µ ένα καιgrave υasperacuteδωρ . The ancient city was located under the modern one; the combined evidence from chance finds and salvage excavations indicates the existence of a settlement there already in the Classical period, although continuous occupation since Antiquity has made it impossible to reconstruct its organisation (for remains from the Classical period, see e.g. Vallianou ( 1987 ); cf. Barr ., H only). The traces of Classical habitation and the fact that there is no doubt that Herakleion was a polis in the political sense during the Heltic period recommend its inclusion in the Inventory as a possible polis (type C). For Strabo, Herakleion was the harbour of Knosos, έχει δ ' επίνειον τοgrave ' Ηράκλειον ηasper Κνωσσός (Strabo 10 . 4 . 7 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the C3m agreement between Knosos and Miletos ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 37 ). For the individual use of the city-ethnic there is the graffito of Φιλῖνος ' Ηρακλειώτας ( SB 4272 (C3f)) and the proxeny decree of Aptara for [ ∆α ] µ άτριος καιgrave ' Ορθόννας Ευacuteφρονος [ καιgrave ] Νέαρχος Ευνοιdieresisacuteδα καιgrave Φίλων Παρ µ εν [---' Ηρακλ ] ειῶται ( I.Cret. ii .iii. 11 C (C2 ))."
962,Hierapytna (Hierapytnios),Crete,35.0,25.45,769,4205,"962 . Hierapytna (Hierapytnios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 00 , long. 25 . 45 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: B. The toponym is ' Ιεράπυντνα , ηasper ( I.Cret. iii .iii. 1 B (C3l); IG xii . 5 840 (C3m)). Stephanos records three earlier names: ηasper πρότερον Κυacuteρβα , εῖτα Πυacuteτνα , εῖτα Κά µ ιρος (Steph. Byz. 328 . 4 -5 ). For Κά µ ιρος , cf. the tribal name Κα µ ιρίς infra . The city-ethnic is ' Ιεραπυacuteτνιος ( I.Cret. iii .iii. 1 A (C3s), iv. 3 (C3e)). Probably the earliest ancient sources to call Hierapytna a polis in the political sense are the decree of isopoliteia with Arkades ( I.Cret. iii .iii. 1 B 10 (C3l)) and the alliance between Hierapytna and Rhodos ( I.Cret. iii .iii. 3 A (C3l)). Hierapytna is included in the Inventory as a probable polis (type B) largely on the strength of its mint, which began to strike coins in C4f ( infra ). The collective and internal use of the city-ethnic occurs in the alliance with Antigonos Doson ( I.Cret. iii .iii. 1 A (C3s)). For the individual use of the city-ethnic there is the decree of Lilaia in honour of Ευρυκάρτης Αρισταγόρου ' Ιεραπυacuteτνιος ( FD iii . 4 134 (C3l)). The polis -town of Hierapytna was more than likely located in the vicinity of the modern city of Ierapetra. To date almost nothing from the Archaic and Classical periods has come to light (for a description of the Archaic and Classical material from these periods on display in the Archaeological Museum of Ierapetra, see Papadakis ( 1986 ) 77 -80 ). On current evidence it would seem that Hierapytna was a foundation of C5f at the earliest. Several public buildings and open-air meeting places are attested epigraphically: prytaneion ( I.Cret. iii .iii. 3 C (C3l/C2e)); χορός ( I.Cret. iii .iv. 1 (C3e)); τοgrave ανδρήιον ( I.Cret. iii .iii. 4 (C3l/C2e)). In so far as these buildings/open-air meeting places are attested at other Cretan poleis during the Archaic and Classical periods ( prytaneion : see Lato (no. 971 ); choros : see *Eltynia (no. 958 ) supra ; Lyktos (no. 974 ); andreion : see Axos (no. 950 ), Datala (no. 954 ) and *Eltynia, no. 958 ), it is possible that also at Hierapytna (no. 962 ) they were pre-Heltic. The protecting deity of the polis was probably Athene Polias, in whose sanctuary public enactments were displayed ( I.Cret. iii .iii. 3 C, ll. 9 -10 (C3l/C2e), 4 ll. 78 -79 (C3l/C2e), 5 ll. 5 -6 (C2 )). Strabo indicates that the polis of Larisa (see Introduction) joined with Hierapytna in a synoecism (Strabo 9 . 5 . 19 ). Larisa has been identified with the substantial LM iii CClassical settlement on Prophitis Elias (Watrous and Blitzer ( 1995 )). Surface remains indicate that this settlement was abandoned by c. 325 . If the identification is correct, the settlement history of Larisa suggests that her synoecism with Hierapytna occurred late in the Classical period. The borders of Hierapytna are attested only in documents of the Heltic period (Hierapytna and Priansos: I.Cret. iv 174 ll. 30 -32 (C3l/C2e); Hierapytna and Praisos: I.Cret . iii .iv. 9 ll. 65 -67 (rC3l/C2f)). At some time before C2l Hierapytna may have made the Archaic and Classical settlement at Oleros (see Introduction) a dependent polis whose territory either lay within or shared a border with the territory of Hierapytna (Perlman ( 1995 b ) 131 -35 , 138 -39 ). The names of three tribes, attested in the dating formulas of C2magistral dedications but likely to be early and so included here, have been identified as Hierapytnian: ∆υ µ αtildeνες ( I.Cret. iii .iii. 9 ), Πά µ φυλοι ( I.Cret. iii .v. 1 with Guarducci ( 1942 ) 133 , from Oleros) and Κα µ ιρίς ( I.Cret. iii .ii. 1 with Jones, POAG 231 : an unusual feminine adjectival form in ις perhaps comprising a stratum of the population claiming descent from Rhodian colonists; from the sanctuary of Zeus Diktaios at Palaikastro). Hierapytna struck coins (staters) on the Aiginetan standard from C4f. Types: obv . ΙΡ ΑΠ Υ between the limbs of a triskeles ; rev . boar protome (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XVII. 6 , with Head, HN ² 468 ). Later issues ( c. 330 -280 / 270 ) have obv . head of Zeus; rev . palm tree and eagle; legend: ΙΕΡΑ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XVII. 7 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 190 , 197 -98 )."
963,Hyrtakina (Hyrtakinios),Crete,35.15,23.45,675,3519,"963 . Hyrtakina (Hyrtakinios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 15 , long. 23 . 45 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: [A]. The toponym is preserved in literary sources, where it is variously spelled ' Υρτακίνα (Ps.-Skylax 47 ), ' Υρτακός (Steph. Byz. 652 . 20 ) and ' Υρτακῖνος (Steph. Byz. 652 . 20 ). The city-ethnic is either ' Υρτακίνιος ( SEG 9 2 (C4s); coins, C4s-C3f, infra ; I.Cret . ii .xv. 2 (C2f)) or ' Υρτακῖνος ( Milet . i . 3 38 .frg.ll, 5 -6 (C3s)). In Ps.-Skylax 47 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Hyrtakina is one of the toponyms listed under the heading πόλεις πολλαιgrave εν Κρήτηι . The earliest explicit reference to Hyrtakina as a polis , and here in the political sense, occurs in the renewal of asylia for Teos ( I.Cret . ii .xv. 2 (C2m)).There is little doubt that Hyrtakina was a polis in the political sense during the late Classical period. The evidence for this is: (i) striking coins as early as c. 330 ( infra ); (ii) forming an alliance with Lisos in C4s/C3s (coins, see infra ); (iii) inclusion among the communities given grain by Kyrene in the 320 s ( SEG 9 2 . 49 ); (iv) membership in the C4l-C3federation of the Oreioi (van Effenterre ( 1948 a ) 119 -27 ; Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 106 -8 , 421 -22 ; cf. Sekunda ( 2000 ) 337 -38 : league founded C3f). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the coins ( infra ), and externally in the list of recipients of grain from Kyrene during the grain crisis of the 320 s ( SEG 9 2 . 49 ). For the individual use of the city-ethnic there is the grave stele of ∆ιόδοτος Πάτρωνος ' Υρτακῖνος from Sidon ( Rev. Bib. ( 1904 ) 552 (C2 )). The polis town of Hyrtakina occupied a fortified hill (Kastri), but archaeological investigation of the settlement has been minimal. On current evidence the principal phases of occupation date to the Classical and Heltic periods. Early explorers describe two sectors of the city in some detail: (i) along the southern sector of the fortification wall, where there is a gate with a road which can be traced from the south (perhaps from Lisos,Niniou-Kindeli ( 1990 )) leading into the city; and (ii) inside the city to the west near the fortification wall, where there is a large building and a public? cistern (Savignoni and de Sanctis ( 1901 ) 408 -24 ). An open-air sanctuary of Pan (C4 -C3 ) was located at the eastern edge of the acropolis (Theophanides ( 1942 -44 b )). The late Classical or Heltic circuit wall is built of polygonal masonry (Savignoni and de Sanctis ( 1901 ) 408 -24 ). Tombs (C5 -C4 ) are numerous on the southern and northern slopes of the acropolis and on the hill Ag. Ioannis to the east. The existence of a prytaneion called the ∆ελφίνιον may be inferred from the offer of ξενία επιgrave ταgraveν κοιναgraveν εasperστίαν ες τοgrave ∆ελφίνιον ( I.Cret. ii .xv. 2 (C2m)). If so, in so far as the prytaneion is attested elsewhere on Crete during the Classical period (see Lato (no. 971 )), it is possible that also at Hyrtakina it was pre-Heltic. Hyrtakina struck coins (drachms) during the period c. 330 -280 / 270 . Types: obv . Goat's head, legend: ΥΡ , ΥΡΤΑ or ΥΡΤΑΚΙΝΙΩΝ ; rev. bee (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XVIII. 7 -11 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 197 -98 ). In C4s-C3f (cf. Sekunda ( 2000 ) 337 , c. C3m), Lisos and Hyrtakina produced an alliance coinage of small denominations in silver and gold. Types: obv ./ rev . dove (or eagle?), or dolphin, or star; legend ( obv ./ rev .): Λ -Υ , ΥΡ -ΛΙ or ΥΡ -ΛΙΣΙΩΝ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XVIII. 12 -20 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl . 469 )."
964,Istron (Istronios),Crete,35.1,27.15,404,2010,"964 . Istron (Istronios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 10 , long. 27 . 15 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: C. The toponym is /acuteΙστρων ( I.Cret. i .xiv. 1 (C3l)). The city-ethnic is ' Ιστρώνιος ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 38 ( c. 259 -250 ); IG xii . 5 suppl. 304 (C3m)). The earliest reference to Istron as a polis in the political sense occurs in an agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 38 ( c. 259 -250 )). Istron was located in the vicinity of the modern village of Kalo Khorio on Mirabello Bay. The ancient settlement on the small promontory of Nisi Pandeleimon seems the most likely candidate for its urban centre. The surface remains are Archaic and later (Hayden et al . ( 1992 ) 298 , 330 -32 , 343 /NP 1 ; cf. Barr . H and later). This and the fact that there is no doubt that Istron was a polis in the political sense during the Heltic period recommend its inclusion in the Inventory as a possible polis (type C). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in the agreement between Knosos and Miletos ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 38 ( c. 259 -250 )) and in an asylia decree for Teos ( I.Cret. i .xiv. 1 (C3l)). For the individual use of the city-ethnic there is the proxeny? decree for Απολλώνιος Νίκωνος ' Ιστρώνιος ( IG xii . 5 suppl. 304 (C3m)). The largest buildings on Nisi Pandeleimon are on the south-eastern knob of the promontory and on its southern slopes. A stretch of circuit wall ( c. 1 . 5 m thick) is preserved just above sea level on the north-western side of the promontory (Hayden et al . ( 1992 ) 330 -32 , 343 /NP 1 ). In treaties of C2l the eastern border of Lato seems to encompass the territory of ancient Istron, suggesting that by then the polis had been absorbed by Lato (Faure ( 1967 ) 111 ; van Effenterre and Bougrat ( 1969 ) 38 ; Hayden et al . ( 1992 ) 299 with fig. 3 ). The protecting deity of Istron was Athene Polias,in whose sanctuary the public enactments of the polis were displayed ( I.Cret . i .xiv. 1 (C3l))."
965,Itanos (Itanios),Crete,35.15,26.15,998,5379,"965 . Itanos (Itanios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 15 , long. 26 . 15 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: A. The toponym is /acuteΙτανος , οasper (Hdt. 4 . 151 . 2 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ιτάνιος ( I.Cret . iii .vii. 3 (C6 ?); coins, C4s-C3f, infra ). The earliest reference to Itanos as a polis in the urban sense occurs in Herodotos' narrative of the foundation of Kyrene (Hdt. 4 . 151 . 2 (rC7 )). Messengers from Thera arrived ες /acuteΙτανον πόλιν . The earliest uses of the term in its political sense occur in Heltic inscriptions ( I.Cret . iii .iv. 2 -3 ( c. 266 / 5 -263 / 2 ), 8 (C3f)). The city-ethnic ΙΤΑΝΙΟΝ is attested in an Archaic rupestral inscription written boustrophedon in the epichoric alphabet ( I.Cret . iii .vii. 3 (C6 ?)). It is unclear whether the use is individual or collective. The first certain example of the collective use of the city-ethnic internally occurs on the coins (C4s-C3f, infra ) and externally in an Archaic law of Lyktos ( SEG 35 991 A (C6l); cf. Faure ( 1993 ) 69 -70 ). For the individual use of the city-ethnic there is the signature of the sculptor ∆α µ οκράτης Αριστο µ ήδεος ' Ιτάνιος ( I.Cret . iii .iii. 31 (C3 /C2 )). Apart from a possible reference to hostilities with Lyktos ( SEG 35 991 A (C6l); cf. Faure ( 1993 ) 69 -70 ), all evidence for the foreign relations of Itanos is Heltic. Apart from the story of the participation of the Itanian purple-fisher, Korobios, in Thera's colonisation of Kyrene (Hdt. 4 . 151 -53 (rC7 )) and the possible reference to hostilities with Lyktos ( supra ), evidence for the foreign relations of Itanos is Heltic. The presence of pottery from Corinth (C7e-C6e), Attika (C6f-C4 , but nothing from c. 470 -420 ), Ionia, Paros(?), Knosos (Orientalising and Heltic), Eleutherna (Orientalising and Heltic) and Aphrati attests Itanos' participation in intra-island and Mediterranean trading networks, but is not sufficient to demonstrate direct relations with any one of these places (Greco et al . ( 1999 ); Tsingarida ( 2001 )). The Itanians distinguished between their territory on Crete itself ( χώρα ) and several small islands which they claimed,the most important of which was Λευacuteκη (probably modern Kouphonisi) ( I.Cret . iii .iv. 8 ll. 9 -11 (C3f), 9 ll. 37 -39 and passim (C2l)). The Magnesian arbitration of the dispute between Itanos and Hierapytna describes the southern border of Itanos ( I.Cret . iii .iv. 9 ll. 59 -67 (C2l)). The sanctuary of Zeus Diktaios at Palaikastro was located near this border (Chaniotis ( 1988 ); cf. Perlman ( 1995 a )). For the extent of the territory of Itanos (from the sanctuary of Zeus Diktaios in the south to the sanctuary of Athena Samonia on Cape Sideros to the north), see Kalpaxis et al . ( 1995 ). The polis townof Itanos was built on two small acropolises, the eastern acropolis (altitude 24 . 35 m) and the western acropolis (altitude 17 . 45 m). A large hill (altitude 61 m) delimits the plain of Itanos to the south.Public buildings are likely to have been located on the two small acropolises. The east acropolis may have been fortified. A monumental terrace on the west acropolis was probably built to accommodate a temple. A rectangular basin of roughly 80 -90 m (east-west) by 50 -60 m (north-south), possibly an ancient harbour,has been identified immediately to the south of the two acropolises. The agora may have been just to the north of the harbour more or less between the two acropolises. The southern hill was protected by a fortification wall with towers. The western line of this fortification may have extended north beyond the hill to defend the harbour and the two acropolises. The polis town is estimated to have covered roughly 40 ha.A large, roughly trapezoidal building with a central hearth in the main room, tentatively identified as an andreion , was built in the Archaic period (abandoned C5f) in the area of a Geometric cemetery on a low hill to the north of the acropolises (Viviers ( 2001 )). During the late Classical period a cemetery was established on a terrace east of the Archaic building. Apart from the Archaic building, all other walls in the polis town (fortification, building and terrace) appear to be Heltic and later, but pottery from the Archaic and Classical periods is reported from the east acropolis, the Heltic and later residential quarter in the saddle between the two akropolises, and the rural sanctuary and temple (of Demeter?) at Βά µ ιες . See Gallett de Santerre ( 1951 ); Deschayes ( 1951 ); Kalpaxis et al . ( 1995 ); Greco et al . ( 1996 ), ( 1997 ), ( 1998 a ), ( 1998 b ), ( 1999 ). Itanos began to strike coins on the Aiginetan standard c. 380 . Subsequent issues are sporadic (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 196 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) 53 -54 ). The earliest coins (staters and obols, c. 380 -320 ) have obv . marine deity; rev . star (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XVIII. 21 -36 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 196 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl . 470 -71 ), later opposing sea monsters; legend: ΙΤΑ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XVIII. 37 ). Itanos continued to mint this latter type ( obv . marine deity; rev . opposing sea monsters; legend: ΙΤΑΝΙΟΝ or ΙΤΑΝΙΩΝ ) during the period c. 320 -280 / 270 (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XIX. 1 -9 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 196 ) and introduced a new series with obv . head of Athena; rev . eagle or star; legend: ΙΤΑΝΙΟΝ / ΙΤΑΝΙΩΝ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XIX. 10 -24 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 196 )."
966,Keraia (Keraïtas),Crete,35.25,24.0,361,1853,"966 . Keraia (Keraïtas) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 25 , long. 24 . 00 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. The toponym is Κεραία ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 111 ( c. 230 -210 )). The city-ethnic is Κεραιdieresisacuteτας (coins, infra ); cf. Κεραιίται ( I.Magnesia 21 (C2e)), Κερέται (Polyb. 4 . 53 . 6 ), Κερεάτης (Steph. Byz. 167 . 4 -5 ). No ancient source identifies Keraia as a polis . But there is no question that Keraia was a polis in the political sense during the Heltic period (Polyb. 4 . 55 . 2 ; I.Magnesia 21 (C2e); I.Cret . iv 179 ( c. 183 )). Keraia is included in the Inventory as a probable polis (type B) on the strength of its mint, which may have begun production as early as c. 330 ( infra ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the coins ( infra ), and externally in the alliance of Keraia and the members of the Cretan koinon with Eumenes II ( I.Cret . iv 179 ( c. 183 )). For the individual use there is the proxeny decree of Gortyn for Βωλαγόρας Νεοκουacuteδιος Κεραιdieresisacuteτας ( I.Cret . iv 206 K (C3 /C2 )). The remains of the polis town at Meskla occupied at least two and possibly three hills: (i) Τειχίδια with stretches of fortification walls built of large blocks without mortar; (ii) Πουλέ with a C4 rampart and a bastion; and (iii) Ζαγρέ or Ζαγροπαπουacuteρα with Roman villas. Surface remains date from the Archaic through the Byzantine period. The southern frontier of Keraia was defended by a guard-post at Βουσσαλόπορος . A second guard-post was located to the south of Meskla at ' Ελληνικό (Faure ( 1962 ) 49 -54 ). Keraia struck coins (drachms) during the period c. 330 -280 / 270 . Types: obv . head of Artemis wearing a crown of goat horns; rev . heads of a javeline and an arrow; legend: ΚΕΡΑΙΤΑΝ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl.

967,Knosos (Knosios),Crete,35.2,25.1,1803,9198,"967 . Knosos (Knosios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 20 , long. 25 . 10 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: A. The toponym is Κνωσός , ηasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 646 ; Pl. Leg . 753 A), in Linear B, ko-no-so (McArthur ( 1993 ) 21 -23 ). According to Strabo, Knosos was formerly called Καίρατος , the ancient name (now revived) of the river and river valley wherein Knosos is located (Strabo 10 . 4 . 8 ). The city-ethnic is Κνώσιος (coins, C4f, see infra ; SEG 9 2 . 31 , 59 (C4s)). Literary sources use both these and geminated forms of the toponym ( Κνωσσός , Diod. 16 . 62 . 3 ) and the city-ethnic ( Κνώσσιος , Hdt. 3 . 122 . 2 ). Geminated forms do not appear in the inscriptions. Knosos is called a polis in the political sense in the agreement of Knosos, Tylisos and Argos which provides for the division of booty αι δεgrave συ µ πλέονες πόλιες . . . έλοιεν (ML 42 B. 31 -32 (C5m) = Nomima i 54 . ii ). It is most likely that Knosos should be understood as one of the poleis . In literary sources Knosos is called a polis both in the political sense (Pl. Leg . 702 C, 752 E) and in the urban sense ( Hymn. Hom. Ap. 477 ; Bacchyl. 1 . 123 , in both cases in a mythological context). The phrase Κνωσία πα ´ τρα occurs in Pind. Ol . 12 . 16 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the coins ( infra ) and externally in the agreement of Knosos, Tylisos and Argos (ML 42 B. 8 (C5m)), in the proxeny decree of Mausolos and Artemisia for the Knosioi ( I.Labraunda 40 (C4m)),and in the list of recipients of grain from Kyrene during the grain crisis of the 320 s ( SEG 9 2 . 31 , 59 ). For the individual use there is the sculptor Α µ φίων Ακέστορος Κνώσσιος who made the statue of Battos and Libya riding in a chariot which Pausanias saw at Delphi (Paus. 10 . 15 . 7 (rC5 )). The individual use is not attested epigraphically before C4 ( Γλυκέρα Αντιόχο Κνωσίο , IG ii² 9044 (C4f)). Very little is known about the Archaic and Classical (preC4m) history of Knosos.According to Strabo, in the time of Homer and for a long while thereafter Knosos was the most illustrious polis on Crete. She later lost her leading position to Gortyn and Lyktos, but managed to recover her former status as the metropolis of Crete (Strabo 10 . 4 . 7 ). Pindar indicates that Knosos suffered a period of stasis in C5e, which resulted in the exile or immigration to Himera of the long-distance runner ' Εργοτέλης Φιλάνορος , twice victor at the Pythian Games and once at the Olympian (Pind. Ol . 12 . 16 (C5f)). Knosos is not known to have produced other Panhellenic victors, but Knosos and Tylisos agreed to dedicate jointly at Delphi a tithe of the booty they captured together (ML 42 B. 7 -10 (C5m)). Knosos and Tylisos formed an alliance in C5m (ML 42 ). The assembly of Argos ( τοgrave πλ ˜ εθος ) served as the mediator in the resolution of disputes between the two poleis concerning questions of war and peace (ML 42 A. 6 -17 ; Merrill ( 1991 ); cf. ML: the text implies a federal structure with a federal assembly called τοgrave πλ ˜ εθος which decided questions of war and peace; members included Knosos, Tylisos and Argos, and perhaps other states as well ( συ µ πλέονες πολίες , ML 42 B. 31 -32 ); cf. Gschnitzer ( 1958 ) 44 -47 : ML 42 is an alliance between Knosos and Argos; Tylisos is a dependency of Argos). The border between Knosos and Tylisos ( οtildeροι ταtildeς γαtildeς ) is described in this alliance ( 26 -29 , infra ), and regulations concerning property and trade are stipulated: (i) both poleis are prohibited from absorbing territory ( χόρα ) belonging to the other ( 25 -26 ); (ii) Knosioi are prohibited from owning land in Tylisos ( µ εgrave ' νπιπασκέσθο ), although a Tylisios may own land in Knosos ( 23 -25 ); (iii) export from Tylisos to Knosos and from Knosos to Tylisos is tax-free; (iv) Tylisioi pay the same taxes as citizens of Knosos for trans-shipment from Knosos ( 11 -14 ). After a gap in the historical record of almost a century,evidence for the history of Knosos resumes in C4m, when Mausolos and Artemisia issue a proxeny decree for the Knosioi ( I.Labraunda 40 ( c. 357 )), and Knosos hires mercenaries of Phalaikos for a campaign against Lyktos (Diod. 16 . 62 ( 346 )), and honours the Athenians with a gold crown ( IG ii² 1443 . ii . 121 -22 ( 345 / 4 )). The κόσ µ οι appear to have been the chief magistrates of the polis already in the Classical period. They were responsible for providing foreign envoys with ξένια . The βολά oversaw the κόσ µ οι (ML 42 B. 40 -42 (C5m)). Although the phylai appear only in Heltic sources,they are likely to be early and so are mentioned here.Five tribal names are attested: (i) Αρχήια or Αρχεία ( I.Cret. i .viii. 10 (C2e); SEG 33 729 (C1 ); cf. the sanctuary of the hero Αρχός at Archanes, ML 42 B. 27 , 35 -36 (C5m)); (ii) Πά µ φυλοι ( I.Cret. iv 181 (C2f)); (iii) Ε [---c. 8 ---] ( I.Cret. iv 182 (C2f)); (iv) Αιθαλεῖς ( I.Cret. iv 197 (C2 )); (v) ' Υλλεῖς ( SEG 33 728 (C1 )). The territory of Knosos is called (in Argolic) ταgrave Κνο h ία γά (ML 42 A. 21 -22 (C5m)). If the river mentioned in the C5m description of the border of Knosos and Tylisos is the Platyperama (ML 42 B. 28 ), the territory of Knosos reached the north coast between Herakleion and Apellonia. To the east her territory encompassed the sanctuary of Zeus Thenatas at Amnisos (Chaniotis ( 1992 )), while to the south it extended towards modern Archanes (ML 42 B. 2 -4 ; see Huxley ( 1994 ) 126 -27 for a brief discussion of the territory; cf. also I.Cret. i .ix. 1 B. 52 for a C3 reference to the borders ( ουρεία ) of Knosos, and I.Cret. iv 182 and Polyb. 22 . 15 . 1 for the C2f border of Knosos and Gortyn). Strabo identifies Herakleion and earlier (in the time of Minos) Amnisos as the harbours ( επίνειον ) of Knosos (Strabo 10 . 4 . 7 -8 ). The so-called cave of Eleithyia was located within the territory of Knosos (see e.g. Paus. 1 . 18 . 5 ; Strabo 10 . 4 . 8 ). The polis town of Knosos seems to have enjoyed nearly continuous habitation from prehistoric times and always to have been settled as an urban centre with the important exception of the period c. 630 -525 , when on current evidence the settlement appears to have been largely abandoned (Coldstream ( 1984 ); Coldstream and Huxley ( 1999 )). Very little is known about the polis town of Archaic and Classical Knosos (for the Archaic and Classical remains within the urban centre of Knosos, see Hood and Smyth ( 1981 ); Coldstream and Macdonald ( 1997 ); Coldstream ( 1999 ), ( 2000 )). According to Strabo, the circuit of the ancient city was 30 stadia (Strabo 10 . 4 . 7 ), but there is no archaeological evidence that a circuit wall protected the polis town. For a Classical fort (C4 ) on Kefala ridge north of the Minoan Palace, see Hood and Boardman ( 1957 ). The public centre of the polis town is suspected to have been in the region of the Roman Civil Basilica, c. 0 . 5 km to the north-west of the Minoan palace, where architectural blocks bearing the text (painted) of a law were found ( I.Cret . i .viii. 5 (C3 )). Three early sanctuaries have been excavated: (i) of Rhea? (C5 and earlier?) above the ruins of the South Propylaion of the Minoan palace (Evans ( 1928 ) 3 -5 ; Coldstream ( 2000 ) 284 -88 ); (ii) of Demeter (from C8 onwards) south of the Minoan palace on Lower Gipsades Hill (Coldstream ( 1973 )); (iii) of Glaukos? (from c. 500 ) west of the Minoan palace (Callaghan ( 1978 )). Deposits of Archaic (with the C6 gap) and Classical material, but no architecture, have been found in the Stratigraphical Museum excavations (Warren ( 1984 -85 )), above the Unexplored Mansion (Sackett ( 1992 ) 6 -8 ), to the south-west of the Minoan palace (Coldstream and Macdonald ( 1997 )), and on both sides of the Royal Road (Coldstream ( 1973 )). There is almost no burial evidence from Knosos later than c. 630 (Coldstream and Huxley ( 1999 ) 294 -96 ). Knosos struck coins on the Aiginetan standard from c. C5m (Price ( 1981 ), c. 450 -425 ; Le Rider ( 1966 ) 175 -80 , 195 , c. 425 ). The earliest ( c. C5m-C4m) coins (staters, drachms, hemidrachms) have obv . Minotaur; rev . labyrinth (cruciform), or rarely the head of a youth (Svoronos ( 1890 ) 66 no. 11 : Theseus or Apollo?); obols have obv . Minotaur; rev . star; legend (on staters only): none at first, later ΚΝΟΣ written retrograde in the epichoric alphabet (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. IV. 23 -32 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 175 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl. 368 ). The next series of staters ( c. 340 / 330 -320 ) has obv . female head (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 15 n. 5 : Pasiphaï, Britomartis or Ariadne?); rev . seated male figure (Zeus or Minos), or a bull's head within the labyrinth; legend: ΚΝΩΣΙΩΝ , or in one case ΜΙΝΩΣ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pls. IV . 33 -35 , V. 1 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 175 -76 ). Staters struck during the period c. 320 -280 / 270 have: obv . head of Hera; rev . labyrinth. Drachms of this period have (i) obv . head of Hera; rev . labyrinth; (ii) head of Apollo; rev . Zeus Nikephoros seated inside the labyrinth.Hemidrachms and obols have obv . head of Apollo; rev . labyrinth (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pls. V. 2 -22 , VI. 1 -9 , 15 -16 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 176 -80 ; SNG Cop.Aeg.Isl . 369 -70 , 373 )."

The toponym is Κυδωνία , ηasper (Thuc. 2 . 85 . 5 ; IG ii² 399 (C4s)), in Linear B, ku-do-ni-ja (McArthur ( 1993 ) 21 -23 ). The city-ethnic is Κυδωνιάτας ( IG iv 683 (C5m); Thuc. 2 . 85 . 5 ). On the assertion of Stephanos that Κυδωνία was formerly called Απολλωνία (Steph. Byz. 390 . 17 ), see Guarducci ( 1939 ) 105 . The term πόλις occurs in a dedication to Apollo,Artemis and Lato from Chania ( SEG 33 735 ; cf. SEG 40775 = CEG 846 (C4f)). The polis in question is probably Kydonia, and the use of the term is probably political. Polis in the urban sense is attested in Ephor. fr. 29 , in Ps.-Skylax 47 ( πόλις implied; see Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ), and in Diod. 16 . 63 . 3 (r 343 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins C4s-C3e ( infra ), and externally in Thucydides' account of the Athenian expedition to Crete in 429 (Thuc. 2 . 85 . 5 ) and in the list of recipients of grain from Kyrene during the grain crisis of the 320 s ( SEG 9 2 . 26 ). For the individual use of the city-ethnic there are the two signatures of sculptors, Αριστοκληtildeς Κυδωνιάτης from Olympia (Paus. 5 . 25 . 11 (rC6 , not properly retrospective if Pausanias here quotes the inscription)) and Κρησίλας Κυδωνιάτας from Hermione ( IG iv 683 (C5m)) and the graffito of ' Ονάσανδρος Κυδωνιάτας from Abydos ( IGA 3 405 (C4 )). According to legend, Kydonia was founded by Minos or Kydas ( IG xii . 5 104 . 21 -22 ; Diod. 5 . 78 . 2 ; Paus. 8 . 53 . 4 ). In light of the continuous settlement of Chania from C8s ( infra ), the story told by Herodotos about the foundation of Kydonia by Samian exiles ( αυτοιgrave [Samians] δεgrave Κυδωνίην τηgraveν εν Κρήτηsubiotaη έκτισεν ) probably refers to a refoundation or resettlement of the polis (Hdt. 3 . 44 . 1 , 59 . 1 -3 (r 524 ); for the meaning of κτίζω in Herodotos, see Casewitz ( 1985 )). The Samians remained there for five years, but in the sixth year ( 519 ), Aiginetans and Cretans defeated them in a sea battle, and the Aiginetans resettled Kydonia as a colony (Strabo 8 . 6 . 16 ; for the possible economic motives behind Samian and Aiginetan interest in Kydonia, see Stefanakis ( 1999 ) 250 -57 ; for the identification of the Κυδῶνες as the descendants of the pre-Greek inhabitants of west Crete and for their fate following Aigina's colonisation of Kydonia, see Sekunda ( 2000 ) 330 -37 ). In 429 the Athenians responded to the request of Nikias, the Gortynian proxenos of Athens,and ravaged the territory of Kydonia (Thuc. 2 . 85 . 5 -86 . 1 ). The attack may have been motivated in part by pro-Spartan sympathies if not outright support for Sparta on the part of the descendants of the Aiginetan settlers, together perhaps with more recent arrivals from Aigina following the Athenian expulsions in 457 / 6 and 431 (Figueira ( 1988 ) 538 -42 ). Phalaikos was killed during his unsuccessful siege of Kydonia in 343 (Diod. 16 . 63 ; Paus. 10 . 2 . 7 ). The list of leases of land and houses to seven proxenoi ( I.Cret. ii .x. 1 (C3 )) provides precious information about the organisation of the territory of Kydonia.Combined with the archaeological evidence, it can be used retrospectively for the Archaic and Classical periods. The leases refer to vineyards ε µ Μολοχαtildeντι εν τῶι πεδίωι , εν τῶι πεδίωι καταgrave Βάθειαν , εν Μινώιαι ποιgrave τῶι πόρωι εσχάτωι , εν ταtildeι νάσωι (Marangou-Lerat ( 1995 ) 11 -13 : Akrotiri peninsula), επιgrave Λίπαραι , and εν Σχινουacuteρι ; houses εν ταtildeι ' Ηραιdieresisacuteδι and εν ταtildeι Λαχανίαι κ ( ώ ) µ αι ; and fallow land ποιgrave ταtildeι Κω µ ίκου . The κώ µ η Laxania has been identified with the substantial fortified site (Archaic through Byzantine) on Kastellos Varypetro about 7 km south-west of Chania (Faure ( 1988 ) 90 ; Erickson ( 2000 ) 260 ). Minoa has been identified with the remains (Archaic through Roman) of a large coastal settlement at modern Marathi on Akrotiri peninsula (Blackman ( 1976 d )). The settlement possessed an important cult (of Diktynna?) at Marathospelios (Faure ( 1964 ) 186 -87 ) and territory extending north-west to the isthmus of the peninsula (Marangou-Lerat ( 1995 ) 10 -13 ). Lipara has been identified with one of the small islands located in Souda Bay opposite Marathi (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 117 ). For a discussion of these toponyms, see Perlman ( 1996 ) 243 -44 , where I distinguish between two types of sub-unit of the polis : (i) villages like Laxania and Heraïs which were not political units, and (ii) a second category of community of which Minoa, Molokas, Vatheia, Lipara and Schinouris are examples.These latter consisted of a settlement and agricultural lands, including some state-owned parcels, and may have been political units dependent upon or part of Kydonia. The continuous occupation of the city of Chania since C8 , coupled with the building activity of the Venetians, who dismantled many of the earlier structures for building material to reuse in their own buildings,has made it difficult to reconstruct the organisation of the Greek polis . Rescue excavations have provided most of what is known archaeologically about the Archaic and Classical periods (see e.g. KrEst 7 ( 1999 ) 143 -66 , describing eighteen rescue excavations conducted in Chania during the period 1995 -97 ). Late Geometric material from Kastelli Hill suggests that the Greek settlement was established there in C8 (Andreadaki-Vlasaki ( 1997 ) 239 ; for Archaic and Classical deposits on Kastelli, see Hallager et al . ( 1997 ) 202 -4 ; Hahn ( 1997 ) 209 ; ArchDelt 45 ( 1990 ) Chron . 433 -35 ). Kastelli perhaps served as the acropolis for the community. Literary testimonia indicate that the urban centre was fortified during the late Classical and Heltic periods (Diod. 16 . 63 . 3 (r 343 ); Polyb. 4 . 55 . 4 (r 220 -219 )). It is likely, though not certain, that these fortifications protected the acropolis. The extent of the Classical and Heltic urban centre is suggested by the location of graves dating to these periods within the limits of the modern city in the areas of Ag. Ioannis, the law courts, the public park and the stadium (Pologiorgi ( 1985 )). No public buildings of the Greek polis have been discovered, although it seems likely that there was a temple near Plataia in 1866 , where the fragment of an Archaic limestone frieze now on display in the Archaeological Museum of Chania (Inv. no. 92 ) was found (Theophanides ( 1956 )). Herodotos records that the Samian exiles who refounded or resettled Kydonia built the temples which were still there in his day, as well as the temple of Diktynna on Rhodopou Peninsula ( ταgrave ιasperραgrave ταgrave εν Κυδωνίηsubiotaη εόντα νυtildeν ουaspertildeτοι εισιgrave οιasper ποιήσαντες καιgrave τοgraveν τηtildeς ∆ικτυacuteνης νηόν , Hdt. 3 . 59 . 1 -3 (r 524 )). Onorio Belli reported having seen a temple with a Doric portico, a theatre and an aqueduct, although both the locations and the dates of these structures are today unknown (Falkener ( 1854 ) 27 -28 ). It seems likely that the ancient harbour was in the same place as the Venetian harbour to the north of Kastelli, and that the Venetian mole was built on an earlier mole. Skylax reports that the harbour of Kydonia could be closed (Ps.-Skylax 47 ). Kydonia struck pseudo-Aiginetan hemidrachms and obols ( c. 475 -280 ), distinguished from Aiginetan coins by fabric, style and the frequent representation of a crescent on either obverse or reverse. Types: obv . tortoise; rev . incuse square (Robinson ( 1928 ); Le Rider ( 1966 ) 173 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl. 402 -5 ). During the period c. 320 -280 / 270 , Kydonia struck coins (staters, drachms, obols), also on the Aiginetan standard but with different types (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 194 ). Staters have obv . head of a nymph or goddess (Frost ( 1996 ): Akakallis?); rev . youthful naked archer stringing his bow, or hound suckling an infant (Kydon). Drachms have (i) obv . head of a nymph or goddess; rev . naked hunter, or dog feeding Kydon; (ii) obv . head of Athene; rev . dog feeding Kydon. Obols have (i) obv . head of a youth with horns; rev . dog; (ii) obv . head of a nymph or goddess; rev . head of a bull, or Κ , or dot within three crescent moons, or dot within three dotted crescent moons; (iii) obv . head of nymph or goddess; rev . amphora. Legend (on some coins of all denominations): ΚΥ∆ΩΝ or further abbreviations down to Κ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. IX. 1 -9 , 13 -18 , 22 -30 ; SNG Cop.Aeg.Isl. 406 -11 )."

Geog. 3 . 17 . 6 ; Steph.Byz. 399 . 3 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on the coins of C4m ( infra ). Ancient Kytaion has not been securely located. The ancient geographers place Kytaion to the west of Apellonia (Plin. HN 4 . 59 ; Ptol. Geog . 3 . 17 . 6 ). Stefanakis suggests a location on the small bay just north of the modern village of Sisses at Almyrida, where remains dating to the Neolithic, Minoan, Heltic and Roman periods have been identified as well as traces of an ancient harbour (Stefanakis ( 1998 )). Alexiou identifies the settlement at Almyrida as an otherwise unattested ancient toponym *Sisa on the basis of the discovery there of an altar which bears the inscription Σισαίων ( ArchDelt 21 ( 1966 ) Chron . 407 -8 ; cf. Stefanakis ( 1998 ) 99 -100 : a tribal name or a neighbouring minor settlement). The only ancient source to identify Kytaion as a polis is Stephanos (Steph. Byz. 399 . 3 ). Nonnos Dion . 13 . 238 calls Kytaion a town, άστεα καλαgrave Κυταίου . A small issue (only three known examples) of overstruck silver staters dating to the period c. 350 -325 has been attributed to Kytaion (Hill ( 1927 ) 46 pl. VI. 4 , with Stefanakis ( 1998 )). Types: obv . wreathed male head facing r.; rev . tripod; legend: ΚΥ (Hill ( 1927 ) 46 pl. VI. 4 ). The coins, which may begin as early as c. 350 , suggest that Kytaion was a polis in the late Classical period and so recommend her inclusion in the Inventory as a probable polis (type B). They share the obverse and reverse types of Axos. Stefanakis interprets this as evidence of an alliance between the two poleis (ibid.). Almyrida provides the most convenient coastal access for Axos.If Kytaion was indeed located at Almyrida, it seems likely that not long after the minting of these coins Axos absorbed this small polis (ibid.)."
970,Lappa (Lappaios),Crete,35.15,24.2,815,4178,"970 . Lappa (Lappaios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 15 ; long. 24 . 20 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: B. The toponym is Λάππα , ηasper ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 115 ( c. 230 -210 ); I.Cret . iv 186 B + 187 (C3l/C2e)). For the spelling Λά µ πη / Λά µ παι in the geographers and lexicographers, see Guarducci ( 1939 ) 191 . The city-ethnic is Λαππαῖος (coins, C4s-C3f, infra ; I.Cret . ii .xvi. 2 (C3f)). The earliest attestation of Lappa as a polis in the political sense occurs in an asylia decree of Lappa for Teos ( I.Cret . ii .xvi. 3 (C3l)). For the earliest reference to Lappa as a polis in the topographical sense, see Polyb. 4 . 54 . 4 -5 (r 221 -219 ). Lappa is included in the Inventory as a probable polis (type B) because (i) the earliest coins of Lappa may date to c. 330 ( infra ), and (ii) there was a territory called ηasper Λαππαία already in C4 (Ps.-Skylax 47 ; Theophr. Hist. pl. 2 . 6 . 9 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the coins ( infra ), and externally in the asylia decree for Tenos ( I.Cret . ii .xvi. 2 (C3f)). For the individual use, there is the decree of Tenos honouring Απελληtildeς Α µ φικλέους Λαππαῖος and other Cretans ( IG xii . 5 suppl. 304 (C3m)). A fragment of an Archaic inscription from Lappa may preserve the only documentary evidence from Crete for the basileus , ΒΑΣΙΛΙ [---] ( I.Cret . ii .xvi. 1 (C5e)). Otherwise all evidence for the political institutions of Lappa is Heltic. The territory of Lappa, the only polis situated at the narrow isthmus ( 18 km wide) of west Crete, may have extended from the north coast to the south coast, as suggested by Ps.Skylax 47 : εῖτα ηasper Λα µ παία ( sc . χώρα ) καιgrave διήκει αυasperacuteτη α µ φοτέρωθεν . Two settlements on the north coast probably lay within the territory of Lappa: (i) ' Υδρα µ ία , probably located near the modern village of Dramia at the mouth of the river Mousella (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 183 ), and (ii) Α µ φί µ αλα , located in the vicinity of the modern village of Giorgioupoli at the mouth of the river Almyros (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 183 ). Stephanos ( 90 . 9 -11 ), quoting Xenion (( FGrHist 460 ) fr. 12 ; cf. Stadiasmus 346 ) identified Amphimala as a polis , whereas Strabo called it a κατοικία (Strabo 10 . 4 . 3 ). According to Strabo, Phoinix was located within the territory of Lappa on the south coast of Crete (Strabo 10 . 4 . 3 ). Guarducci locates Phoinix a few kilometres to the west of modern Sellia (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 192 ). This Phoinix is not to be confused with the homonymous port at modern Loutro, some 26 km to the west. Finally, it is worth noting that the only freshwater lake on the island of Crete, Lake Kournas (the ancient λί µ νη Κορησία ), probably lay within the territory of Lappa (Steph. Byz. 374 . 12 -15 ; Guarducci ( 1939 ) 192 ). The archaeological remains of ancient Lappa extend chiefly over the hill that is bounded by the rivers Mousella and Petre, on the site of modern Argyropoli. The earliest evidence of habitation dates to the early Geometric period. Apart from stretches of the pseudo-isodomic Heltic fortification walls, very little of the ancient settlement is visible today (Sanders ( 1982 ) 163 ( 14 / 1 )). The agora may have been located at 'Lephou' , where three marble statues of the Roman period were found ( ArchDelt 15 ( 1933 -35 ) 66 -70 ). Lappa struck coins (staters, drachms, obols) on the Aiginetan standard during the period c. 330 -280 / 270 . Types (stater): obv . head of a nymph or goddess (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 194 , Artemis?); legend: ΛΑΠΠΑΙΟΝ written retrograde; rev . Apollo kitharodos , seated; legend: ΑΠΟΛΛΟΝ (Brett ( 1974 ) no. 1282 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 190 , 198 ). Types (drachm and obol): obv . same as stater, or frontal bull's head with one horn curving down; rev . frontal bull's head with one horn curving down, or Λ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XIX. 28 -30 , 33 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl. 479 ). Early travellers to Crete noted the existence of silver mines (and gold and lead?) in the vicinity of Lappa, from which probably derives the name of the modern village on the site of ancient Lappa, Argyropoli or 'Silverado' (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 260 ; cf. Markoe ( 1998 ) 238 )."
971,Lato (Latios),Crete,35.1,25.4,1274,6563,"971 . Lato (Latios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 10 , long. 25 . 40 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: B. The toponym is Λατώ ( I.Cret . i .xvi. 1 (C3l)); Λατῶς on the coins is genitive (Svoronos ( 1890 ) 220 . 5 , 7 ). The city-ethnic Λάτιος ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 38 ( c. 259 -250 )) suggests an alternative thematic stem for the toponym (Bile ( 1988 ) 202 n. 185 ). A second community of Latioi , called Λάτιοι οιasper προgraveς / επιgrave Κα µ άραι , was established on the coast in the vicinity of Ag. Nikolaos by C3l ( I.Cret . i .xvi. 15 (C3l), 19 (C2e)). The precise political nature of this community and its relationship to 'upper'Lato, 5 km to the south-west, remain uncertain (Perlman ( 1995 b ) 133 -35 ; Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 104 -8 , 428 -29 : sympoliteia ). I.Cret . i .xvi. 15 and i .xvi. 2 seem to preserve identical asylia decrees for Teos save that the former has as its heading Λατίων τῶν προgraveς Κα µ άραι while the latter has Λατίων . I.Cret . i .xvi. 19 is too fragmentary to draw any conclusions about its contents. All other inscriptions pertaining to Lato refer only to οιasper Λάτιοι without drawing any distinction between two different groups of Latioi . Stephanos provides an entry for Κα µ άρα but not for Λατώ (Steph. Byz. 351 . 1 -2 ). Xenion, Stephanos' source, identifies Κα µ άρα as a Cretan polis which was also called Lato, ηasperacuteτις Λατωgrave ελεγέτω (Xenion ( FGrHist 460 ) fr. 7 ). The earliest reference to Lato as a polis in the political sense occurs in the first line of the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 38 ( 259 -250 )). The prytaneion has been dated to C4s ( infra ), as have several other public buildings at Lato. This suggests that Lato should be numbered among the Classical, if not the Archaic, poleis (type B) of Crete despite the fact that the evidence for the political status of the community dates no earlier than C3 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in the treaty between Lato and Hierapytna ( I.Cret . i .xvi. 16 (C3l)) and externally in Milet . i . 3 140 . 38 ( c. 259 -250 ). It is worth noting that the individual use of the city-ethnic is not attested for Lato, with the possible exception of an entry of Stephanos, who adduces Νέαρχος Ληταῖος , Alexander's commander, as an example of the ethnic of Makedonian Λητή (Steph. Byz. 413 . 21 ). Nearchos was a Cretan (Arr. Ind . 10 , 18 . 4 ), perhaps from Lato if we may so interpret the passage from Stephanos. Although the phylai appear only in Heltic sources, they are likely to be early and so are mentioned here. Four tribal names are attested (all in inscriptions of C2s): (i) Αισχεῖς ( BCH 62 ( 1938 ) 405 -8 no. 4 ; I.Cret i .xvi. 29 , 30 ); (ii) ' Εχανορεῖς ( I.Cret . i .xvi. 25 , 31 , 34 ); (iii) Συνανεῖς ( BCH 62 ( 1938 ) 390 no. 1 ); (iv) ' Υλλεῖς ( I.Cret i .xvi. 26 , 32 ; SEG 32 895 ). Several treaties (all C2l) describe the Heltic borders (a circuit of c. 66 km) of Lato and her neighbours ( I.Cret. i .xvi. 18 ; REA 44 ( 1942 ) 35 -36 C. 49 -56 ; SEG 26 1049 . 52 -82 ; I.Cret. i .xvi. 5 . 51 -72 ; for discussion, see Faure ( 1972 ); van Effenterre and Bougrat ( 1969 ); for the context, see Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 318 -32 ). The borders are twice described as 'old' ( SEG 26 1049 . 60 -62 : [ κα ] θωgraveς καιgrave π [ ά ] λαι επιγέ [ γραπται ]; REA 44 ( 1942 ) 35 -36 C. 51 -52 : οasperacuteπως αυτοῖς οιasper οasperacuteροι έσονται οιasper αρχαῖοι ). One of the landmarks on the border between Lato and Olous was τοgrave αρχαῖον Αφροδίσιον ( I.Cret. i .xvi. 18 . 7 -8 ; SEG 26 1049 . 63 -64 ; I.Cret. i .xvi. 5 . 70 ), identified with the early sanctuary (Protogeometric?, Geometric?) at Sta Lenika (Bousquet ( 1938 ); Mazarakis Ainian ( 1997 ) 215 -16 ). The polis town of Lato was built on a double acropolis ( 300 -400 m).Residential areas were located on the terraced slopes of both hills. The public buildings were located in the saddle between the two. This area has come to be called the agora, although the term is not attested epigraphically at Lato.In the centre of the agora at the lowest point of the saddle there is a cistern and a small shrine. A Doric stoa delimits the agora to the west, and a rectangular exedra marks the boundary to the south. A broad flight of steps to the north leads up to the prytaneion complex (Ducrey and Picard ( 1972 )). The steps accommodate c. 180 standing or c. 80 seated persons and may have been used as, e.g., a dikasterion (Hansen and Fischer-Hansen ( 1994 ) 63 ). To the south-east of the central area and at a higher elevation there is a theatre or theatral area (Ducrey and Picard ( 1971 )) accommodating c. 350 persons and sometimes interpreted as an ekklesiasterion (cf. Hansen and Fischer-Hansen ( 1994 ) 65 ). The main temple of the polis townis located on a terrace above the theatral area (Ducrey and Picard ( 1970 )). The identity of the deity worshipped there is not known. The protecting deity of Lato seems to have been Eleuthyia, in whose sanctuary public documents were displayed (e.g. I.Cret. i .xvi. 2 , 15 (C3l)). The location of her sanctuary is not known.The polis town was defended by the terrain, by defence walls and by 'fortress-houses' (J. Demargne ( 1901 ); Hadjimichali ( 1971 ); Ducrey and Picard ( 1996 )). Water was supplied by public and private cisterns (Hadjimichali ( 1971 )). The principal entrance to the polis town was from the south-west, where a road passes through the main gate and then branches to the west and to the east. The eastern branch leads to the agora and then continues along the edge of the saddle to the north-east (Tiré and van Effenterre ( 1978 )). The buildings described above appear to date to C4s-C3e. Evidence for earlier occupation includes the east terrace of the agora (C7 ),Archaic figurines from beneath the shrine in the agora, and a potter's workshop ( c. 650 -625 ) located beneath the terrace of the main temple (Ducrey and Picard ( 1969 )). Also Archaic is the extra-urban sanctuary (C8m-C3 ) on Mt. Thilakas, located 1 . 5 km south-east of the polis town (Reinach ( 1913 )). For general descriptions, see Tiré and van Effenterre ( 1978 ) 98 -105 ; Ducrey and Picard ( 1976 ); Picard ( 1992 ); for a plan of the remains, see J. Demargne ( 1901 ) pl. XX. The settlement of Λάτιοι προgraveς / επιgrave Κα µ άραι at Ag. Nikolaos remains largely unknown archaeologically save for its cemeteries (Davaras ( 1978 )). Lato struck coins on the Attic standard in C3l (Picard ( 1990 ); Guarducci ( 1935 ) 108 ; SNG Cop.Aeg.Isl. 484 -86 )."
972,Lebena (Lebenaios),Crete,34.55,24.55,498,2625,"972 . Lebena (Lebenaios) Map 60 . Lat. 34 . 55 , long. 24 . 55 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: C. The toponym was probably originally * Λεβήν (Bile ( 1988 ) 167 -68 ), later Λεβήνα ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 8 ( c. 230 -210 )). The city-ethnic is Λεβεναῖος ( I.Cret . iv 63 (C6l/C5e)), later Λεβηναῖος ( I.Cret . ii .xvii. 7 (C2 )). No ancient source identifies Lebena as a polis . According to Strabo 10 . 4 . 11 , Lebena was the emporion of Gortyn, and we should perhaps understand Lebena as the limen held by the Gortynian νεώτεροι during the stasis which erupted in Gortyn at the time of the Lyktian War (Polyb. 4 . 55 . 6 (r 221 -219 )). However, an Archaic inscription seems to preserve an agreement, perhaps a commercial agreement, between οι Γορτυacuteνιοι and οι Λεβεναῖοι ( I.Cret . iv 63 (C6l/C5e)). Not only is the collective use of the ethnic good evidence for polis status on Crete (Perlman ( 1996 ) 246 -52 ), but there is no indication from what survives of the text that ο Λεβεναῖος was politically or legally inferior to ο Γορτυacuteνιος . On the basis of this text, it seems possible that Lebena was a polis (type C) in the political sense in the late Archaic period. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a lex sacra ( I.Cret . i .xvii. 7 (C2 )) and externally in the agreement between Gortyn and Lebena ( I.Cret . iv 63 (C6l/C5e)). Lebena is the only Cretan community where the individual use of the city-ethnic occurs internally, in three cure inscriptions from the sanctuary of Asklepios ( I.Cret . i .xvii. 8 , 9 , 15 (C2 -C1 )). For the individual use of the city-ethnic externally, there is the Heltic graffito of the Cretan mercenary Σωτάδας Λεβηναῖος , who scratched his name on a noble's tomb in the Thebaid ( Syringes 816 ( = Baillet ( 1920 -26 ))). Lebena is best known for her Asklepieion, the excavated remains of which are principally late Heltic and Roman (Bultrighini ( 1993 ) 81 -99 ; Kritzas ( 1992 -93 )). Apart from the theorodokos appointed by Lebena c. 230 -210 to entertain the Delphic theoroi ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 8 ; Rigsby ( 1986 ) 353 n. 13 ), there is no evidence that after c. C5m Lebena had her own officials or the authority to pass public enactments. When and under what circumstances this came about and the nature of her political status and relationship with Gortyn thereafter remain uncertain. The personal use of the city-ethnic is a good indication of polis status on Crete (Perlman ( 1996 ) 250 -52 ), and Lebena should perhaps be regarded as one of the dependent poleis of Gortyn during the late Classical and Heltic periods (ibid. 269 -70 )."
973,Lisos (Lisios),Crete,35.15,23.5,759,4014,"973 . Lisos (Lisios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 15 , long. 23 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: A. The toponym is Λισός ( I.Cret . ii .xvii. 1 (C3f); BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 105 ( c. 230 -210 )). For Λίσσα (Ps.-Skylax 47 ), see Guarducci ( 1939 ) 210 . The city-ethnic is Λίσιος (coins, infra ; SEG 45 1314 (C3 /C2 )). A bronze fraction has the legend ΛΙΣΣΙΤΑΝ on the reverse (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XX. 34 ). Guarducci (( 1939 ) 211 ) suggested Λισσί ( ων ) ΤΑΝ , with ΤΑΝ the first three letters of a magistrate's name. Neither the city-ethnic Λισσίτης nor geminated forms are otherwise attested epigraphically (for the use of such forms by the geographers, see Guarducci ( 1939 ) 210 ). For a connection with Homeric λισσηgrave πέτρη see Guarducci ( 1939 ) 110 ; Bile ( 1988 ) 181 . Ps.-Skylax 47 provides the earliest reference to Lisos as a polis , in this case in the urban sense. The earliest secure references to Lisos as a polis in the political sense occur in enactment formulas of the Heltic period ( SEG 45 1314 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic occurs internally on the C4s-C3f coins ( infra ) and in the enactment formulas of Heltic inscriptions ( SEG 45 1314 ). For a possible example of the collective use externally ([ Λισ ( σ )?] ιοι ), see I.Cret . iv 179 . 8 ( c. 183 ). For a possible example of the individual use of the city-ethnic there is the proxenos ? of Gortyn [ Μ ] ενοίτιος Τυχα µ ένους Λ [ ίσιος ?] ( I.Cret . iv 387 (C2 )). Lisos formedanalliancewithHyrtakina(coins, infra ) and was a member of the C4l-C3federation οιasper /acuteΟρειοι (van Effenterre ( 1948 a ) 119 -27 ; Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 106 -8 , 421 -22 ; cf. Sekunda( 2000 ) 337 -38 : league foundedC3f).Lisosmayhave been at one time the federation's capital (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 211 ) or its religious centre (Bultrighini ( 1993 ) 107 -13 ). The remains of the polis town of Lisos occupy the floor and slopes of a small valley on Ag. Kyrkos Bay. The earliest remains appear to date to C5l or C4f. Rock cuttings on the slopes to the east of the valley floor indicate the presence there of a residential quarter (personal observation). Terraces on these same slopes may be ancient. The Roman cemetery with its barrel-vaulted tombs was located on the western slopes above the valley floor (Sanders ( 1982 ) 42 ). The location of the earlier cemetery is unknown. The valley floor was most likely the location of the harbour. Tectonic uplift, probably in ad 438 (Thommeret et al . ( 1981 )), raised this part of the Cretan coast. A sea wall protected the shore from marine erosion (observation of E. Hadjidaki). The protecting deity of Lisos was probably Diktynna (coins, C4s-C3f, infra ; I.Cret . ii .xvii. 1 (C3f)). Her sanctuary is attested epigraphically, but has not been located ( I.Cret . ii .xvii. 1 (C3f)). A sanctuary in honour of Asklepios and Hygieia ( peribolos wall, Doric limestone temple and auxiliary buildings) was located near a spring below the cliffs to the north of the valley floor. The sanctuary was excavated during the period 1957 -60 and appears to date primarily to the Heltic and Roman periods. For a brief overview with references to the interim excavation reports, see Platon ( 1992 ); for the cult, see Bultrighini ( 1993 ) 102 -13 . A small theatre (internal diameter of the cavea approximately 15 m) was located in the valley to the south-west of the sanctuary of Asklepios and Hygieia (Sanders ( 1982 ) 171 -72 ( 19 / 18 )). The visible remains are Roman. Traces of an ancient road (communicating with Hyrtakina?) are visible on the western slopes above the valley floor (Niniou-Kindeli ( 1990 )). Lisos and Hyrtakina produced an alliance coinage of small denominations in silver and gold (C4s-C3f; cf. Sekunda ( 2000 ) 337 : c. C3m). Types: obv ./ rev . dove (or eagle?), or dolphin, or star. Legend ( obv ., rev .): Λ -Υ , ΥΡ -ΛΙ , or ΥΡ -ΛΙΣΙΩΝ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XVIII. 12 -20 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl . 469 ). Lisos struck her own coinage (bronze) in C3s (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XVIII. 12 -20 )."
974,Lyktos (Lyktios),Crete,35.15,25.2,1842,9869,"974 . Lyktos (Lyktios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 15 , long. 25 . 20 . Size of territory: 4 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Λυacuteκτος (Hom. Il . 2 . 647 , 17 . 611 ; Hes. Th . 477 ). The city-ethnic is Λυacuteκτιος ( I.Cret . i .xviii. 4 (C6 ); SEG 35 991 (C6l)). The earliest coins have ΛΥΤΙΟΝ (C5s, infra ). Later issues have at first ΛΥΚΤΙΟΝ and later the assimilated form ΛΥΤΤΙΟΝ ( infra ).Assimilated forms of both the toponym Λυacuteττος and the city-ethnic Λυacuteττιος begin to appear in the inscriptions from Crete in C3m (e.g. I.Cret . iii .vi. 11 -12 ; I.Cret . i .xviii. 8 ) and outside Crete already in C5s ( I.Lindos 13 ; cf. Bile ( 1988 ) 156 n. 345 ); but the unassimilated forms continue in use (e.g. Arist. Pol . 1271 b 28 ). Polybios claimed that Lyktos was the oldest of the Cretan poleis (Polyb. 4 . 54 . 6 ), but the earliest unquestionable attestations of Lyktos as a polis occur in the enactment formula of the alliance of Lyktos with Antiochos II ( I.Cret . i .xviii. 8 . 5 (C3m)) and in the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι including Lyktos ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 ( c. 259 -250 )). The use in both is political. For polis in the urban sense, see Ps.-Skylax 47 , where Lyktos is listed under the heading πόλεις πολλαιgrave εν Κρήτηsubiotaη . Diodoros calls Lyktos a polis in the urban sense in his account of the destruction of Lyktos in C4m (Diod. 16 . 62 . 3 ). There is no question that Lyktos was an Archaic and Classical polis , but without an early attestation of the term in reference to the community, Lyktos is included in the Inventory as a probable polis (type B). The collective use of the city-ethnic occurs internally in three Archaic laws, once in an uncertain context in the singular ( I.Cret . i .xviii. 4 . 5 -6 (C6l)) and twice in enactment formulas ( SEG 35 . 991 A. 1 and B. 1 (C6l/C5e)). It occurs externally in the treaty between Lyktos and Lindos ( I.Lindos 13 . 1 -2 (C5s)). For the individual use there are, e.g., the proxenos of Gortyn, ∆α µ όχαρις Φαλακρία Λυacuteττιος ( I.Cret . iv 206 (C3 /C2 )) and the mercenary Ανδροκάδης Χαιρωνίδος Κρηgraveς Λυacuteττιος who died at Pagasai ( IG ix² 365 (C3 )). In Greek epic, Lyktos was the home of Koiranos,the charioteer of Meriones (Hom. Il. 17 . 611 ). Later tradition, first attested in Ephorus and Aristotle, maintained that the Spartans had colonised Lyktos (Ephor.frr. 147 -49 ; Arist. Pol . 1271 b 28 -30 ; Malkin ( 1994 ) 73 -83 ). Plutarch preserved a story which synchronised the colonisation of Lyktos with that of Melos in C8 , and identified the Spartan oecist of Lyktos as Pollis (Plut. Mor . 247 E). Archers from Lyktos fought with the Spartans in the Second Messenian War (Paus. 4 . 19 . 4 (rC7 )).According to Spartan tradition,Lykourgos modelled his reforms on the laws of Minos, which were still used by the descendants of the pre-Spartan inhabitants of the region (Arist. Pol . 1271 b 28 -30 ; cf. Ephor. frr. 147 -49 ; Perlman ( 1992 )). Several Archaic public inscriptions of Lyktos (all laws?) survive ( I.Cret. i .xviii. 1 -6 ; SEG 35 991 A, B (C6m-C5e)). According to Strabo, Lyktos and Gortyn for a time superseded Knosos as the foremost cities of Crete (Strabo 10 . 4 . 7 ). Both the late Archaic period (Viviers ( 1994 ) 252 -59 ; Coldstream and Huxley ( 1999 ) 301 -4 ) and C4e (Erickson ( 2000 ) 331 -65 ) have been proposed as periods of Lyktian expansion. In C5Lyktos and Lindos concluded a treaty, perhaps ending a period of hostilities ( I.Lindos 13 (C5s)). Knosos twice conquered Lyktos: in C4m the Lyktians were expelled with the aid of the Phokian general Phalaikos (Diod. 16 . 62 . 3 -4 (rC4m));and the city was destroyed during the Lyktian War (Polyb. 4 . 53 -54 (r 221 -219 )). Lyktos was resettled both times, in the first instance with the help of King Archidamos of Sparta (Diod. 16 . 62 . 4 ). Two of the Archaic laws of Lyktos preserve the enactment formula /acuteΕΓaltαδε Λυκτίοισι ( SEG 35 991 A. 1 and B. 1 (C6l/C5e)). SEG 35 991 A concerns the exclusion of αλοπολιάται , non-citizens, foreigners, or expatriates (van Effenterre and van Effenterre ( 1985 ) 179 -88 ), and assesses fines against those who harbour them. The same term may be restored in another of the Archaic laws ([ αλο ] πολιαταν in I.Cret. i .xviii. 2 (C6l)); on the other hand, this text may preserve the term for citizen, πολιάτας . The only social status term that occurs in the early inscriptions from Lyktos is Γaltοικευacuteς ( I.Cret. i .xviii. 5 (C6l)). The occurrence of the terms µ αιτυρ [---] ('witness') and [--ο ] µ ο µ οτας ('coswearer') in the lines immediately preceding Γaltοικευacuteς indicate that the context of the reference is a law concerning judicial procedure. The kosmate is referred to in two laws ( I.Cret. i .xviii. 2 (C6l); SEG 35 991 A 4 -5 (C6l/C5e)); in neither case is the context certain. The term απόκοσ µ ος (for the meaning,' kosmos elect' or 'exkosmos ' , see Bile ( 1988 ) 274 ) occurs together with kosmos in SEG 35 991 A. Other public officials mentioned in the Archaic laws, again in uncertain contexts, are dikastai ([---δ ] ικασταί , I.Cret. i .xviii. 3 (C6l)) and οι εσζικαιωτηtildeρες ( SEG 35 991 A. 8 (C6l/C5e); van Effenterre and van Effenterre ( 1985 ) 176 : 'supervisors'; Chadwick ( 1987 ) 332 -33 : officials who collect fines). The collective use of the city-ethnic in the Archaic enactment formula έΓaltαδε Λυκτίοισι probably refers to the assembly ( SEG 35 991 A. 1 and B. 1 (C6l/C5e)), as does the term πόλις in a Heltic enactment formula, δεδόχθαι Λυττίων τοῖς κόσ µ οις καιgrave τηtildeι πόλει ( I.Cret. i .xviii. 8 (C3m)). The council ( Γaltωλά ) may be referred to in the Archaic law concerning αλοπολιάται and may have enjoyed legislative powers, [ υπεgrave ] ρ Γaltωλαtildeς Γaltαδαtildeς ( SEG 35 991 A. 6 (C6l); Chadwick ( 1987 ) 331 -32 : '[on account of]? the decree of the Council'; cf. van Effenterre and van Effenterre ( 1985 ) 167 -68 , 175 : ε ] /Koppa Γaltωλαtildeς Γaltαδαtildeς , 'par l'application de la loi de exoulé '). Although the phylai appear only in Heltic and later sources,they are likely to be early and so are mentioned here. Four tribal names are attested: (i) Αρχήια ( I.Cret. i .xviii. 12 (Imperial)); (ii) ∆ίφυλοι ( IG ii² 1135 ( 111 / 10 )); (iii) ∆υ µ αtildeνες ( I.Cret. i .xviii. 8 (C3m)); (iv) Λασυacuteνθιοι ( I.Cret. i .xviii. 13 (Imperial)). De Sanctis in Guarducci ( 1935 ) 192 restored [ ' Υ ] α ( κ ) υacuteνθιων , but the tribal name Λασυacuteνθιοι is attested in a C2l inscription from the sanctuary of Hermes and Aphrodite at Kato Syme Biannou (Kritzas ( 2000 )). AnArchaic decree of Lyktos describes the border of public(?) grazing lands within the polis of Lyktos ( SEG 35 991 B. 4 -14 (C6l/C5e)). This text has been understood to indicate the existence of state-owned livestock (van Effenterre and van Effenterre ( 1985 ) 182 -85 ; cf. Chaniotis ( 1995 ) 46 -48 ). Late in the Archaic period Lyktos perhaps shared a border with Datala (no. 954 ). A Heltic treaty between Hierapytna and Lato mentions an earlier written description of the ancient border between Lyktos and Lato, καθωgraveς καιgrave πάλαι επιγέγραπται ( SEG 26 1049 . 60 -62 (C3 /C2 )). *Chersonasos and Lyktos are known to have joined in a sympoliteia some time after c. 183 (Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 104 -8 , 430 -32 ). Henceforth the official name of *Chersonasos was 'Lyktos by the sea' , to distinguish it from the upper ( άνω ) polis (e.g. I.Cret. i .xix. 3 A ( c. 183 )). A reference to 'those up above' ( όζοι άνοθεν ) in an Archaic law from Lyktos ( I.Cret. i .xviii. 1 ( c. 550 -525 )) has been understood to distinguish the upper city (Lyktos) from the coastal city (*Chersonasos) and so to indicate that the sympoliteia (or some other form of political arrangement) was much earlier (Viviers ( 1994 ) 252 -54 ). Lyktos is largely unknown archaeologically. The polis town occupied the summit of a ridge overlooking the upland plain of Pediadha (cf. van Effenterre and Gondiccas ( 1999 ): the Archaic and Classical polis did not have an urban centre but was settled κω µ ηδόν ). The ridge has three peaks, the tallest of which should perhaps be regarded as the acropolis. The earliest evidence for occupation seems to date to the late Geometric or early Archaic period. Buildings of the Archaic (C7l-C6e: CretChron 11 ( 1957 ) 336 ) and Classical (C5s: CretChron 23 ( 1971 ) 496 -97 ) periods have been excavated, although later phases (Heltic and Roman) of Lyktos are better attested archaeologically. A substantial building, perhaps a temple, once occupied the summit of the acropolis. The protecting deity of Lyktos was probably Athene Polias ( I.Cret. iii .iii. 3 B (C3l/C2e); SEG 33 638 (C2l)). The earlier of these two texts was to be displayed in the sanctuary of Athena ε µ πόλει , perhaps a reference to the temple on the acropolis.A choros ([---] οι | /Koppaοροι , dat. sing. or nom. pl.?) is attested epigraphically ( I.Cret. i .xviii. 4 (C6l); Bile ( 1988 ) 344 n. 84 : agora; Kritzas ( 1992 -93 ) 282 -89 : dance floor). The theatre (date?), which was described and drawn by Onorio Belli in 1586 , was probably located at the foot of the acropolis (Falkener ( 1854 ) 17 -19 ; Branigan ( 1979 c )). An Archaic cemetery has been partly excavated at 'these Alonas' near the village of Xida ( ArchDelt 41 ( 1986 ) Chron . 407 ). The extent of the polis town is estimated to have been c. 100 ha (Rhethemiotaki ( 1984 )). Lyktos struck coins (staters, drachms, hemidrachms) on the Aiginetan standard from C5f onwards (Price ( 1981 ): c. 470 -450 ; cf. Le Rider ( 1966 ) 174 , 195 -96 : c. 425 ). All denominations use the same types: obv . eagle, flying or standing; rev . boar's head within square frame; legend, in the epichoric alphabet until C4l: ΛΥΤΙΟΝ , ΛΥΚΤΙΟΝ , or ΛΥΤΤΙΟΝ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXI. 1 -20 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl . 489 -97 )."
975,Malla (Mallaios),Crete,35.05,25.35,506,2679,"975 . Malla (Mallaios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 05 , long. 25 . 35 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: C. The toponym is Μάλλα ( I.Cret . i .xix. 1 (C3m)). The city-ethnic is Μαλλαῖος ( I.Cret . i .xix. 1 (C3m); IG xii suppl. 304 (C3m)). It is worth noting that none of the ancient geographers or lexicographers mentions Malla. The earliest attestation of Malla as a polis in the political sense occurs in the agreement between Malla and Lyktos, which provides that fines are to be paid ταtildeι πόλι ( I.Cret. i .xix. 1 (C3m)).There is no doubt that Malla was a polis in the political sense during the Heltic period. Moreover, although the polis town of Malla has not been identified with certainty, it seems likely that it was located in the vicinity of modern Malles on the eastern slopes of Mt. Dikte, either 'under the now deserted lower village . . . around the church of Ay. Georgios' (Sanders ( 1982 ) 138 ( 2 / 2 )) or between the villages of Malles and Christos, close to the spring of Ag. Paraskevi, with its rocky acropolis 'Skistra' (Nowicki ( 2000 ) 134 -35 no. 55 : surface remains include Archaic and Classical (and earlier) material).Malla was thus an inland and upland settlement, and such settlements were for the most part established well before the end of C5 . For these reasons, Malla is included in the Inventory as a possible polis (type C). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in the agreement between Malla and Lyktos ( I.Cret . i .xix. 1 . 6 (C3m)) and externally in the renewal of asylia for Teos ( I.Cret . i .xix. 2 . 1 (C2f)). For the individual use of the cityethnic there is the honorand of Tenos, Πυacuteθεος Αθήνικος Μαλλαῖος ( IG xii suppl. 304 (C3m)). Although the phylai are attested only in Heltic sources,they are likely to be early and so are mentioned here. The tribal name Αιθαλεῖς is preserved in the dating formula of a public enactment ( I.Cret. i .xix. 3 A ( c. 183 )). Heltic inscriptions refer to the prytaneion ( I.Cret. i .xix. 3 A 38 ( c. 183 )) and the agora ( I.Cret. i .xix. 3 A 50 -51 ( c. 183 )). In so far as both are attested elsewhere on Crete during the Archaic and Classical periods ( prytaneion : see Lato, supra ; agora: see Gortyn, supra ; Phaistos, infra ), it is possible that also at Malla they are pre-Heltic. The protecting deity of Malla was perhaps Zeus Monnitios (public enactments displayed in his sanctuary ( I.Cret. i .xix. 2 (C2m)); coin types, infra ). The location of his temple ( I.Cret . i .xix. 1 (C3m)) is not known. Malla struck a very limited bronze coinage during C3 -C2 . Types: obv . head of Zeus; rev . eagle or thunderbolt; legend: ΜΑΛ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXII. 18 -19 )."
976,Matala (Matalios),Crete,35.0,24.45,608,3086,"976 . Matala (Matalios) Map. 60 . Lat. 35 . 00 ; long. 24 . 45 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. The toponym was Μάταλα , τά ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 14 ( c. 230 -210 ); Stadiasmus 323 ). Cf. Μάταλον (Strabo 10 . 4 . 11 ). The city-ethnic was Ματάλιος ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 67 ( 259 -250 )). The only reference to Matala as a polis in the political sense occurs in the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 67 ( c. 259 -250 )). Matala probably served as the harbour of Phaistos during the Heltic period (Polyb. 4 . 55 . 6 (r 221 -219 ); Cucuzza ( 1997 ) 85 ), although the political ramifications, if any, of this are unclear (Perlman ( 1995 b ) 132 -35 , 138 ). Matala was clearly a polis in the political sense in the early Heltic period when it co-signed the treaty between Phaistos and Miletos ( Milet . i . 3 140 ( c. 259 -250 )) and appointed at least one theorodokos to host theoroi from Delphi ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 14 ( c. 230 -210 )). The archaeological evidence indicates that settlement on Kastri was established during the Classical period ( infra ). Although no public buildings of the Classical period have been identified, the combined evidence of her Classical foundation and early Heltic political status warrants her inclusion in the Inventory as a possible polis (type C). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Milet . i . 3 140 . 67 ( c. 259 -250 ). For the individual use there is the grave stele from Hadra,Egypt,of Αacuteρι &lt; σ &gt; τις Ματάλιος ( SB 5860 + ZPE 14 ( 1974 ) 182 (C3 )). The polis town of ancient Matala was located on a small bay of the Gulf of Matala where the modern village of Matala is situated. The earliest evidence for occupation in the vicinity of the polis town, as well as in its hinterland, is Classical, although it is not until C3 that the ceramic evidence is plentiful (Simpson et al . ( 1995 ) 397 -99 ). No public buildings of the Classical (or even Heltic) period have yet been identified in the polis town, which is estimated to have covered an area of at least 1 ha. A high limestone promontory (Kastri) to the south of the modern village served as the acropolis. It was fortified during the early Byzantine period. Ashlar blocks visible beneath the rubble and concrete construction of the Byzantine wall may belong to an earlier phase (ibid. 329 , 335 ). Rock-cut cisterns (at least thirteen) and traces of walls on the acropolis may attest the presence of houses (ibid. 335 -37 ). The discovery of a kiln (possibly one of several) on the acropolis, which produced good-quality trade amphoras,indicates commercial activity there as well (ibid. 336 ). A ship shed ( 38 m × 5 . 85 m), fish tanks and houses were carved into the cliffs on the south side of Matala Bay (Blackman ( 1973 )). Sea-level changes indicate a terminus ante quem of C1for the ship shed (Gifford ( 1995 ) 75 -79 ). A large structure ( 21 . 40 m × 13 . 80 m) located c. 3 km south-east of Matala at Orthes Petres may be a heroon of C4 -C2 (Simpson et al . ( 1995 ) 342 -43 )."
977,Milatos (Milatios),Crete,35.2,25.35,407,2039,"977 . Milatos (Milatios) Map 59 . Lat. 35 . 20 ; long. 25 . 35 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: C. The toponym is not attested epigraphically and not at all in Doric. In literary sources it is Μίλητος (Hom. Il. 2 . 647 ; Ephor.fr. 127 ). The city-ethnic was Μιλάτιος ( BCH 70 ( 1946 ) 588 -90 no. 1 (C6e); I.Cret. i .ix. 1 . 144 -52 (C6l); cf. Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 200 : c. 220 ). The earliest reference to Milatos as a polis in the political sense occurs in the first line of the agreement of Ionian Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εν Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 36 ( c. 259 -250 )). Strabo 10 . 4 . 14 described Milatos as a polis found in Homer ( Il. 2 . 647 ) which no longer existed because Lyktos destroyed the polis ( κατασκάψαντες τηgraveν πόλιν ) and occupied its chora ( τηgraveν χώραν ενεί µ αντο ) (Strabo 10 . 4 . 14 ). Here the use is probably urban. Milatos is included in the Inventory as a possible polis (type C) principally on the strength of a (possibly) Archaic text embedded in the Heltic Drerian 'oath of the 180 panazostoi agelaoi ' that describes οιasper Μιλάτιοι as having waged war against Dreros ( I.Cret. i .ix. 1 . 137 -64 (C6l) = Nomima i 48 ; cf. Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 200 ). For an earlier attestation of the collective use of the city-ethnic, also external, see BCH 70 ( 1946 ) 588 -90 no. 1 (C6e)). Both the context (border war) and the collective use of the city-ethnic suggest that Milatos was a polis (but cf. Perlman ( 1996 ) 252 -58 ). The polis townof Milatos was located on the peak and the steeply terraced west slopes of Kastellos, directly on the north coast 1 . 5 km north-east of the modern village of Milatos (Nowicki ( 2000 ) 170 -71 ). According to a legend first attested in Ephor. fr. 127 , colonists from Milatos founded Miletos in Asia Minor. During the Archaic period Milatos most likely shared a border with Dreros, with whom she perhaps contended for the possession of some territory ( I.Cret. i .ix. 1 . 137 -64 = Nomima i 48 (C6l); cf. Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 200 ( c. 220 ))."
978,Olous (Olontios),Crete,35.15,25.45,1110,5651,"978 . Olous (Olontios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 15 ; long. 25 . 45 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: B. The toponym is ' Ολουtildeς (Ps.-Skylax 47 ; I.Cret . i .xvi. 3 . 3 (C2 )). The city-ethnic is ' Ολόντιος (coins, C4s-C3f, infra ; I.Cret . i .xxii. 4 A. 21 -22 (C3m)).Forms with an initial Β - (for Γalt -) are common (e.g. I.Cret . i .xviii. 9 . 6 (C2l)); for the retention of Γalt - before a short ο - on Crete, see Bile ( 1988 ) 115 -16 ). Ps.-Skylax 47 identifies Olous as a λι µ ήν . Two inscriptions of C3m provide the earliest references to Olous as a polis in the political sense ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 38 ( c. 259 -250 ); I.Cret . i .xxii. 4 A ii, vii). The earliest attestation of the term in the urban sense occurs in SEG 23 . 547 (C3l/C2e). There is no doubt that Olous was a polis in the political sense by the early Heltic period. The archaeological evidence indicates that settlement on the isthmus of Poros was established perhaps as early as the Archaic period ( infra ). Although no public buildings of the Classical period have been identified, the combined evidence of her Archaic foundation, the possibility that her mint began to strike coins as early as c. 330 and her status as a polis at the beginning of the Heltic period warrants her inclusion in the Inventory as a probable polis (type B) . The collective use of the city-ethnic occurs internally on the coins ( infra ) and in proxeny decrees (e.g. I.Cret . i .xxii. 4 A. 21 -22 (C3m)).The earliest attestation of the collective use of the city-ethnic externally occurs in Milet . i . 3 140 . 38 ( c. 259 -250 ). For the individual use of the city-ethnic there is the graffito of ∆εῖνις Τι µ αγένους [ ' Ο ] λόντιος from the Memnonion at Abydos ( Memnonion 125 , 298 (C3 )). The Heltic borders of Olous are described in several treaties (all C2l) between Olous and her neighbour Lato ( I.Cret. i .xvi. 18 ; RÉA 44 ( 1942 ) 35 -36 C. 51 -56 ; SEG 26 1049 . 62 -66 ; I.Cret. i .xvi. 5 . 69 -72 ; for discussions of these descriptions, see Faure ( 1972 ); van Effenterre and Bougrat ( 1969 ); for the historical context, see Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 318 -32 ). The border with Lato was described as 'old'( SEG 26 1049 . 60 -62 : [ κα ] θωgraveς καιgrave π [ ά ] λαι επιγέ [ γραπται ]; RÉA 44 ( 1942 ) 35 -36 C. 51 -52 : οasperacuteπως αυτοῖς οιasper οasperacuteροι έσονται οιasper αρχαῖοι ). One of the landmarks on the border between Lato and Olous was τοgrave αρχαῖον Αφροδίσιον ( I.Cret. i .xvi. 18 . 7 -8 ; SEG 26 1049 . 63 -64 ; I.Cret. i .xvi. 5 . 70 ), identified with the early sanctuary (Protogeometric?, Geometric?) at Sta Lenika (Bousquet ( 1938 ); Mazarakis Ainian ( 1997 ) 215 -16 ). The size of the territory of Olous in the Heltic period is estimated to have been c. 26 km ² (van Effenterre ( 1992 b )). The polis town of Olous, which was located on the isthmus of Poros (van Effenterre ( 1992 b ); for a map of the region of Olous, see van Effenterre ( 1948 c ) pl. XXVIII), is today largely submerged. The earliest evidence for the settlement on the isthmus is Archaic (Favissa 'votive pit' with Archaic and Classical terracotta figurines, van Effenterre ( 1992 b )). A Submycenaean cemetery was excavated at stous Traphous to the south-west of Poros (van Effenterre ( 1948 c )). A fort ( φρουacuteριον , SEG 23 548 (C2 ); van Effenterre ( 1948 b )) and the sanctuary of Britomartis (van Effenterre ( 1992 b )) were probably situated to the east of Poros on the Spinalonga peninsula. The protecting deity of Olous seems to have been Zeus Tallaios (coins, infra ; oath god, e.g. SEG 23 547 (C3l/C2e); public enactments displayed in his sanctuary, e.g. I.Cret. i .xxii. 4 C (C2 )). The location of this sanctuary and of the prytaneion ( I.Cret. i .xvi. 5 (C2l)) are not known. In so far as a prytaneion is attested elsewhere on Crete during the Classical period (see Lato, infra ), it is possible that also at Olous it was pre-Heltic. A single C6 tholos tomb was found to the north of Poros at Ammoudoplaka ( ArchDelt 21 ( 1966 ) Chron . 407 ), and tombs and grave stelai of C4 and later have been found to the north-west of Poros in the vicinity of the village of Schisma ( ArchDelt 33 ( 1978 ) Chron . 389 -90 ; 43 ( 1988 ) Chron . 567 -70 ) and at Chardaloupas ( ArchDelt 38 ( 1978 ) Chron . 3376 ). Guard-posts (date?) pro- tecting the urban centre of Olous from the west (direction of Dreros), the north (direction of Milatos) and south (direction of Lato) were located on the north slope and summit of Mt. Oxa and to the north at stis Pinès (van Effenterre ( 1948 b )). Surface remains on the summit of Mt. Oxa (perhaps used as a place of refuge by the inhabitants of the polis ?) indicate continuous human presence there from LM iii C to the Byzantine period (Nowicki ( 2000 ) 173 -74 ). A graffito at stis Pinès (date?) records that the spot is 28 stades from the polis , στάδια εκ πόλιος ∆∆ΠΙΙΙ , the correct distance from the guard-post to the isthmus of Poros (van Effenterre ( 1948 b ); cf. SEG 45 1407 bis ). Although the phylai are attested only in Heltic sources,they are likely to be early and so are mentioned here. Two tribal names are preserved in the dating formulas of a public enactments: (i) Πά µ φυλοι Π [ α µ φυacuteλων ] ( I.Cret. i .xxii. 8 (C2 )); (ii) ∆υ µ αtildeνες ( SEG 41 770 (C2l)). Olous struck coins (staters, hemidrachms, obols) on the Aiginetan standard during the period c. 330 -280 / 270 . Types: obv . (all denominations) head of Artemis; rev . (stater): Zeus aetophoros ; (hemidrachm): ΟΛ inside a wreath; (obol): star or tripod. Legend (stater): ΟΛΟΝΤΙΩΝ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXII. 23 -26 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 179 -80 )."
979,Petra (Petraios),Crete,35.15,26.0,256,1355,"979 . *Petra (Petraios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 15 ; long. 26 . 00 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. The toponym is not attested. The city-ethnic is Πετραῖος ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 37 ( c. 259 -250 )). The urban centre of the community of the Petraioi has been identified with the fortified acropolis site (Archaic-Classical) on the north coast of Crete west of Siteia at Liopetra (Faure ( 1963 ) 20 -21 ; for description, see Nowicki ( 2000 ) 101 -2 ). The only ancient reference to the community of the Petraioi as a polis occurs in the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 37 ( c. 259 -250 )). The Petraioi are included in the Inventory as a possible polis (type C) on the strength of this reference-which assures that their community was a polis in the political sense in the early Heltic period-combined with the archaeological evidence for the Archaic-Classical settlement with its fortified acropolis. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Milet . i . 3 140 . 37 . It is worth noting the Gortynian, Μοστυλίων Πετραίω , who was made proxenos and polites of Olous ( I.Cret . i .xxii. 4 A (C3f)). His patronym may attest some association between his family and Petra. Bronze coins (date?) with trident and dolphin have been attributed to the Petraioi (Faure ( 1963 ) 20 -21 )."
980,Phaistos (Phaistios),Crete,35.05,24.5,1305,6738,"980 . Phaistos (Phaistios) Map. 60 . Lat. 35 . 05 , long. 24 . 50 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Φαιστός (Hom. Il . 2 . 648 ; Ps.-Skylax 47 ; Milet . i . 3 140 ( c. 259 -250 )), in Linear B, pa-i-to (McArthur ( 1993 ) 21 -23 ). The city-ethnic is Φαίστιος (coins, from C5m, infra ; the ktetikon ΠΑΙΣΤΙΚΟΝ , written retrograde in epichoric script, occurs on staters of C4s (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 195 pl. XXI. 7 -10 ). For polis in the urban sense, see Ps.-Skylax 47 , where Phaistos is listed under the heading πόλεις πολλαιgrave εν Κρήτηsubiotaη . The earliest reference to Phaistos as a polis in the political sense occurs in the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 51 ( c. 259 -250 )). An Archaic law concerning the renunciation of an adoption ( SEG 32 908 (C6 )) and the mint, which commences C5f ( infra ), provide the best evidence that Phaistos was a polis in the political sense already in the Archaic and Classical periods. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the coins ( infra ) and externally in the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 51 ( c. 259 -250 )). For the individual use there are the two benefactors of Kydonia, Θα µ υκληtildeς Φαίστιος and Φαινοκληtildeς Φαίστιος ( I.Cret . i .x. 1 (C3 )). Phaistos shared a border with Gortyn to the east. The Asterousia mountains formed the frontier between Phaistos and the coastal community of Lassoia, probably a polis during the Heltic period (see Introduction), to the south. To the west, Kommos (perhaps ancient Amyklaion, see Introduction; s.v. Gortyn (no. 960 )) may have served as a harbour for Phaistos, as did Matala (no. 976 ), at least during the Heltic period (Cucuzza ( 1997 ) 85 ). T o the north lay Mt.Ida. The earliest coinage of Phaistos and Gortyn indicates that the two poleis had arranged a sympoliteia by C5m ( infra ), as do Heltic references to Phaistos as the κάτω πόλις and Gortyn as the άνω πόλις ( I.Cret. iv 165 ; SEG 23 563 (both C3s); Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 104 -8 , 422 -28 ). I.Cret. iv 165 , a law enacted by Phaistos and Gortyn ( τάδ έαδε ταῖς πόλιθι ), refers to Phaistos both by name and by the phrase κάτω πόλις . SEG 23 563 , an alliance with Axos, refers to the two communities as οιasper Γορτυacuteνιοι αasper άνω πόλι καιgrave αasper κάτω (Phaistos is not referred to by name in what survives of the text). Gortyn destroyed Phaistos and incorporated her territory c. 150 (Strabo 10 . 4 . 14 ; Cucuzza ( 1997 ) 87 -90 ). Apart from the Archaic law which requires that the renunciation of an adoption take place εν αγορ [ αtildeι ---] ( SEG 32 908 (C6l)), the remaining evidence for the political institutions of the polis is Heltic. During C8 -C7 a substantial settlement occupied the same ridge with its three low hills (from west to east: Christos Efendis, Middle Hill and Palace Hill) as the Minoan palace and town (Cucuzza ( 1998 ); La Rosa ( 1992 ); Levi ( 1964 ), ( 1967 -68 ); Palermo ( 1992 )). Remains of the Archaic and Classical periods are scanty (for the Archaic period,see La Rosa ( 1996 )). It may be that early in C6 the settlement moved down from the hills on to the plain where no excavations have taken place. If so, Middle Hill, the highest of the three hills (altitude 110 m) and fortified during the Subminoan/Protogeometric-Geometric periods, probably served as the acropolis of the polis town. The only public building securely identified as Archaic is the C7l-C6 temple located near a Geometric residential district west of the Palace (La Rosa ( 1996 ) 68 -82 ). The temple, traditionally assigned to Rhea or the 'Magna Mater' , may have belonged to Leto (Cucuzza ( 1993 )). The identification of a second C7 -C6 building, located at Phalandra, 300 m to the west of the Minoan palace, as a temple remains uncertain (Levi ( 1961 -62 ) 462 -67 ; cf. Mazarakis Ainian ( 1997 ) 229 -30 ). The phrase εν αγορ [ αtildeι ---] occurs in an Archaic law inscribed on a building block ( SEG 32 908 (C6l)). If it refers to the meeting place,and not to the meeting,the location of its discovery in the plain 80 m west of Chalara may indicate where the public centre of the Archaic polis lay. For other Archaic remains from Phaistos (architectural fragments in poros, walls and deposits), see La Rosa ( 1996 ). A Heltic inscription mentions τοgrave δικαστήριον τοgrave πολιτικόν (the adjective suggesting more than one court at Phaistos?) and the prytaneion ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 61 -62 , 66 ( c. 259 -250 ); for the prytaneion , see Viviers ( 1994 ) 244 ). In so far as both terms are attested elsewhere on Crete during the Archaic and Classical periods ( dikasterion : see Bionnos? (no. 952 ) and Gortyn (no. 960 ), supra ; prytaneion : see Lato, supra ) it is possible that also at Phaistos they were pre-Heltic. Phaistos struck coins on the Aiginetan standard from c. 470 (Price ( 1981 )). Types on the earliest staters (C5f-C4m) attest a sympoliteia or alliance with Gortyn (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 161 ). Types: obv . Europa riding a bull, facing l.; rev . lion's scalp (Le Rider ( 1966 ) pl. XX. 19 -24 ). The beginning of local coinage at Phaistos (stater with same types as above) is indicated by the legend ( rev .) ΠΑΙΣΤΙΟΝΤΟΠΑΙΜΑ ( Φαιστίων τοgrave παῖ µ α ) written retrograde in the epichoric alphabet (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXII. 34 ; Wroth and Poole ( 1963 ) pl. XIV. 14 ). A rarer early stater has obv . Europa riding a bull; rev . head of Hermes (Le Rider ( 1966 ) pl. XX. 23 ). In the next phase ( c. 360 -340 / 30 ) Phaistos adopts new types for its staters (no legend): (i) obv . seated Europa with bull; rev . seated Hermes; (ii) obv . head of Europa; rev . bull protome (drachms also, Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXIII. 1 ); (iii) obv . winged Talos; rev . head of Europa; (iv) obv . winged Talos; rev . bull protome (Le Rider ( 1966 ) pls. XX. 25 -29 , XXI. 1 -6 ). Staters of the following period ( 340 / 330 -322 ) have obv . Herakles standing, holding his bow and club; rev . bull or a frontal bull's head; legend: ΠΑΙΣΤΙΚΟΝ written retrograde in the epichoric alphabet on some (Le Rider ( 1966 ) pls. XXI. 7 -25 , XXII. 1 -19 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl . 510 -12 ). At the end of C4 ( c. 322 -300 ) new types for the stater appear: (i) obv . Zeus Welchanos seated, with the legend ΓaltΕΛΧΑΝΟΣ , or Herakles (seated, or with a serpent, or attacking the hydra); rev . bull; legend ( obv . or rev .): ΦΑΙΣ , ΦΑΙΣΤΙ or ΦΑΙΣΤΙΩΝ (Le Rider ( 1966 ) pls. XXII. 20 -31 , XXIII. 1 -22 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl . 515 -18 ). Fractions (drachm, hemidrachm) of this period have obv . head of Herakles; rev . frontal bull's head (Le Rider ( 1966 ) pl. XXIV. 5 -23 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl . 513 -14 , 519 )."
981,Phalasarna (Phalasarnios),Crete,35.3,23.35,778,4174,"981 . Phalasarna (Phalasarnios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 30 ; long. 23 . 35 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: A. The toponym is Φαλάσαρνα , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 47 ; BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 102 ( c. 230 -210 )). The city-ethnic is Φαλασάρνιος ( I.Cret . ii .xi. 1 (C3e)). Ps.-Skylax 47 provides the earliest reference to Phalasarna as a polis , in this case in the urban sense. The earliest reference to Phalasarna as a polis in the political sense occurs in the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 39 ( c. 259 -250 )). The Stadiasmus describes Phalasarna as a πόλις παλαιά ( 336 ). Phalasarna was clearly a polis in the early Heltic period. Ps.-Skylax's attestation of polis status in the urban sense is confirmed by the Archaic and Classical remains of the town (especially the temples and fortifications, infra ), and that Phalarsarna was a polis in the political sense as well can be inferred from her mint, which may have commenced as early as c. 330 ( infra ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in a dedication of ηasper πόλις Φαλασαρνίων ( I.Cret . ii .xix. 2 (C3s)), and externally in an enactment formula of the alliance between Phalasarna and Polyrhen ( I.Cret . ii .xi. 1 (C3e); Markoulaki ( 2000 )). For the individual use of the city-ethnic there is the proxenos of Epidauros and theorodokos of Apollo and Asklepios Ανδροκληtildeς ' Επιγένους Φαλασάρνιος ( IG iv² . 1 96 . 12 -13 and SB 1368 (C3m)). The territory of Phalasarna, αasper γαtilde Φαλασαρνία (Markoulaki ( 2000 ) l. 21 (C3e)), included the Grambousa peninsula and the coastal plain known today as Livadhia. The polis shared a border with Polyrhen, with whom she fought in C4l or C3e. Copies of the C3e treaty of peace and alliance that concluded these hostilities were found at the sanctuary of Diktynna on the Rhodopou peninsula ( I.Cret. ii .xi. 1 ) and at a sanctuary at Τυacuteλιφος near Kaliviani (Markoulaki ( 2000 )); the latter was perhaps located on the frontier between Phalasarna and Polyrhen. The polis town of Phalasarna was located on Cape Koutri ( 90 m) and in the plain to its east. The total area occupied by the polis townis estimated to have been c. 60 ha (E.Hadjidaki ( 1992 )). The east and north flanks of the acropolis were fortified, C5 -C4 (Gondiccas ( 1988 ) 86 -92 ; E. Hadjidaki ( 1992 ), ( 1996 )). Public buildings, including at least two temples, were located on the summit of the acropolis (Gondiccas ( 1988 ) 86 -92 ; E. Hadjidaki ( 1992 ), ( 1996 )). One of the two temples probably belonged to the protecting deity of the polis , Artemis Diktynna (Dion. Calliphon., GGM i 119 -22 ). Cisterns and house platforms cut into the rock on the slopes of the acropolis indicate the location of residential areas (Gondiccas ( 1988 ) 86 -92 ; E. Hadjidaki ( 1992 )). The fortifications of the closed harbour, a λι µ ηgraveν κλειστός (Ps.-Skylax 47 ; Dion. Calliphon., GGM i 118 -21 ), located at the foot of the acropolis to the south-east, date to C4s (Frost and Hadjidaki ( 1990 ); E. Hadjidaki ( 1992 ), ( 1996 )). An industrial area of the late Heltic period has been identified near the north-west corner of the harbour (E. Hadjidaki ( 1996 )). The cemetery with pithos burials of C6e-C5m and Heltic cist graves has been partially excavated to the south-east of the harbour (Gondiccas ( 1988 ) 97 -116 ). Quarries were located along the shore to the south of the cemetery (Gondiccas ( 1988 ) 95 ). Three rock-cut 'thrones' (C5 -C3e) located near the cemetery and the quarries may be Phoenician (or Punic); if so, they attest the participation of Phalasarna in the east-west trade of Phoenician mariners (Di Vita ( 1992 -93 )). Phalasarna struck coins (staters) on the Aiginetan standard during the period c. 330 -280 / 270 (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 190 , 198 ; IGCH no. 109 ). Types: obv . head of a female (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 220 : Aphrodite or Phalasarne?); rev . trident-head; legend: ΦΑ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXV. 4 -6 ; SNG Cop.Aeg.Isl . 522 ). Drachms and hemidrachms begin c. 280 with the same types (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXV. 7 -9 , 11 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 188 ; SNG Cop.Aeg.Isl . 523 -25 )."

Stephanos ( 532 . 4 -5 ) lists a Cretan Πολίχνη , ηasper , but there may have been two Cretan communities with this name (Faure ( 1993 ) 67 -68 ), and it cannot be determined to which community the entry in Stephanos refers. The city-ethnic was Πολιχνίτης (Thuc. 2 . 85 . 5 ; cf. Sekunda ( 2000 ) 330 -37 : the term Polichnitai is not a cityethnic but rather the name of a league of small communities of west Crete whose population consisted largely of the descendants of the pre-Greek Κυδῶνες ). The identification of the toponym Polichne with the ancient remains near the modern village of Vryses, Kydonia (Faure ( 1988 ) 91 ; cf. Guarducci ( 1939 ) 233 : Polichna was located at Meskla) is supported by (i) bronze coins with reverse types similar to those of Kydonia which bear the legend ΠΟ ( infra ), and (ii) the story related by Thucydides which suggests that Polichne and Kydonia were neighbours (Thuc. 2 . 85 . 5 ). Polichne is included in the Inventory as a possible polis (type C) chiefly on the evidence of Thucydides ( 2 . 85 . 5 -86 . 1 ). In 429 the Athenians responded to a request of Nikias, the Gortynian proxenos of Athens, and ravaged the territory of Kydonia. Nikias hoped in this way to win for Gortyn the gratitude of the Polichnitai (Figueira ( 1988 ) 538 -42 ). The context and the collective use of the city-ethnic suggest that Polichne was a political community, rather than a sub-unit of another polis (cf. Perlman ( 1996 ) 252 -58 ). The passage further suggests that the relations between Polichne and Kydonia were at times hostile and that other Cretan poleis , in this case Gortyn, took advantage of this. The reverse type (dog) on the bronze coins of Polichne which resembles the reverse type of a series of bronze fractions from Kydonia suggests that Kydonia and Polichne were allies at the time (Stefanakis ( 1996 )). The ancient settlement south of the modern village of Vryses, Kydonia, extends across the two peaks of Ag. Giorgios to the west and Kastellos to the east.Excavations on a modest scale and chance finds suggest that the area was continuously occupied since the Middle Minoan period. The ancient road up to the double acropolis followed a ravine from the north. A wall along the saddle between the two peaks protected the community from the south (Faure ( 1958 ) 499 -501 , ( 1963 ) 21 -22 , ( 1988 ) 91 ; Zoïs ( 1976 ); Nowicki ( 2000 ) 214 -15 ). An Archaic-Classical sanctuary (of Demeter?, Diktynna?, a nymph?) was located on the southern slope of Kastellos (Mortzos ( 1985 )). Polichne produced a small issue of bronze fractions (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. Il. 7 , with Stefanakis ( 1996 ) (C2e)). Types: obv . head of a woman (Diktynna?); rev . dog; legend: ΠΟ ."
983,Polyrhen (Polyrhenios),Crete,35.3,23.4,1023,5521,"983 . Polyrhen (Polyrhenios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 30 , long. 23 . 40 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: [A]. The toponym is either Πολυρήν or Πολυρρήνια . The athematic form (in ην ) is attested epigraphically ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 103 ( c. 230 -210 ); I.Cret . ii .xxiii. 2 (C3 ); IG ii² 844 (C3s)); the thematic form (in -α ) occurs in the geographers (e.g. Ps.-Skylax 47 ). On the athematic toponyms in ην and their recharacterisation as feminine nouns in α , see Bile ( 1988 ) 167 -68 . The city-ethnic was Πολυρήνιος (coins, C4s-C3f, infra ; I.Cret . ii .xi. 1 (C3e)) or Πολυρρήνιος ( SEG 11 414 . 8 (C3s); I.Cret . ii .xxiii. 4 (C2 )). As was recognised in Antiquity, the name means 'rich in lambs'(Steph. Byz. 532 . 13 -14 ). The earliest reference to Polyrhen as a polis in the political sense occurs in the dedication of αasper πόλις αasper Πολυρηνίων to King Areus of Sparta ( I.Cret . ii .xxiii. 12 A (C3f)). Cf. the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 67 ( c. 259 -250 )). For polis in the urban sense, see Ps.-Skylax 47 , where Polyrhen is listed under the heading πόλεις πολλαιgrave εν Κρήτηsubiotaη . Polyrhen was certainly a polis in the political sense by the early Heltic period. That it was a polis in the late Classical period too is indicated by the mint, which may be as early as c. 330 ( infra ). The collective use of the city-ethnic occurs internally on the coins ( infra ) and in the dedication in honour of King Areus of Sparta ( I.Cret . ii .xxiii. 12 A (C3f)), and externally in the agreement with Miletos ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 67 ( c. 259 -250 )). For the individual use there is the proxenos of Oropos Πασῖνος [ Θ ] αρ [ συacute ] νοντος Πολυρήνιος ( IG vii 307 (C3s)). Little is known about the history of the polis prior to the Heltic period. According to Strabo 10 . 4 . 13 , Polyrhen was originally settled in villages ( κω µ ηδοgraveν δ ' Ωsubiotaώκουν ); Achaians and Lakonians subsequently fortified the acropolis at Polyrhen and synoecised the villages (Gondiccas ( 1988 ) 222 -24 ). Malkin, who does not dismiss a priori the tradition of Spartan involvement in the foundation of Polyrhen, argues for a period of Spartan colonisation in C8 (Malkin ( 1994 ) 73 -83 ).Apart from traces of LH iii pottery,the earliest material at Polyrhen appears to be C6l/C5e (Blackman ( 1976 c ); Gondiccas ( 1988 ) 208 ). Ps.-Skylax recorded that the territory of Polyrhen extended from the north toward the south, διήκει αποgrave βορέου προgraveς νότον (Ps.-Skylax 47 ). Gondiccas defines the territory of Polyrhen, αasper γαtilde αasper Πολυρηνία (Markoulaki ( 2000 ) l. 20 (C3e)) as follows: west to the Mesogheia mountains, north to the coast and the port at Kissamos (itself a dependency of Polyrhen, Gondiccas ( 1988 ) 169 -70 ), south to the mountains Kytroulès and Kolymbos (with the small communities beyond the Typhlos gorge-Kantanos, Katre, Pelkisfriendly, but politically insignificant and geographically remote), and east to the Rhodopou peninsula including Pergamon (ibid. 277 -85 ) and the sanctuary of Diktynna on Rhodopou peninsula (ibid. 224 -31 ). Polyrhen shared borders with Kydonia to the east and Phalasarna to the west (Strabo 10 . 4 . 13 ) and fought with the latter in C4l or C3e. Copies of the treaty of peace and alliance that concluded these hostilities were found at the sanctuary of Diktynna ( I.Cret. ii .xi. 1 (C3e)) and at a sanctuary at Τυacuteλιφος , near Kaliviani (Markoulaki ( 2000 )); the latter was perhaps located on the frontier between Polyrhen and Phalasarna. The polis town of Polyrhen was built on the summit and slopes of a steep hill in the mountain range of Prophitis Elias, with the lower town to the south-west of the acropolis ( 418 m). The remains of the polis town cover an area of roughly 30 ha, including the cemetery (C4 and later) to the north-west (Niniou-Kindeli ( 1992 )). Both the lower town and the acropolis were fortified.Ancient walls (C4l/C3e) are traceable on the north and north-west sides of the acropolis and on the north-west (with two towers) and south-east (with gate) sides of the lower town (Blackman ( 1976 c ); Gondiccas ( 1988 ) 175 -77 ; Markoulaki ( 1988 )). Two rock-cut aqueducts supplied water to the city (Blackman ( 1976 c )). Cisterns on the acropolis and in the lower city may be no earlier than the second Byzantine period (ibid.).Apart from a small extra-mural temple (C3 ) located at sto Yero Kolymbo in the gorge to the east of the polis town (Gondiccas ( 1988 ) 183 -85 ) and the cemetery, all remaining traces of the community are intramural (ibid. 173 -83 ). Walls of the early Heltic period attributed to a monumental temple with an altar or stoa along its north side were excavated within the fortification walls in the centre of the lower town, just north of the Church of the Ninety-nine Fathers (Theophanides ( 1942 -44 a ); Gondiccas ( 1988 ) 178 -82 ). Traces of walls and rock cuttings on the south and southeast slopes of the hill and in the village indicate the location of residential areas (Gondiccas ( 1988 ) 182 -83 ; Markoulaki ( 1996 )). Polyrhen minted coins (staters) on the Aiginetan standard during the period c. 330 -280 / 270 . Types: obv . head of Zeus; rev . filleted frontal bull's head; legend: ΠΟΛΥΡΗΝΙΟΝ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXV. 21 -25 , 28 -30 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 190 , 198 ; IGCH no. 109 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl . 528 ). Smaller denominations in silver (drachm, hemidrachm,obol) began c. 280 (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 188 )."
984,Praisos (Praisios),Crete,35.1,26.05,1142,6159,"984 . Praisos (Praisios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 10 , long. 26 . 05 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Πραισός ( I.Cret . iii .iv. 1 (C3e)). The city-ethnic is Πραίσιος (coins, C4s-C3f, infra ; I.Cret . iii .iv. 1 (C3e)). For Πραtildeσος / Πράσιος , see Guarducci ( 1942 ) 135 . In Ps.-Skylax 47 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Praisos is one of the toponyms listed under the heading πόλεις πολλαιgrave εν Κρήτηι . The earliest explicit uses of the term πόλις for Praisos occur in Heltic documents ( I.Cret . iii .iv. 1 (C3e), vi. 7 (C3f)).Although there is no explicit Archaic or Classical reference to Praisos as a polis , her mint, which perhaps began as early as c. 350 , strongly suggests her inclusion in the Inventory as a polis . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the coins ( infra ) and in a decree of Praisos for the Stalitai ( I.Cret . iii .vi. 7 (C4s-C3f, C3f)). The collective use is attested externally in Herodotos'account of the expedition of Minos to Sicily (Hdt. 7 . 170 . 1 ). The Praisioi maintained that they were descendants of the autochthonous Eteocretans (Hdt. 7 . 170 -71 ; Staphylos ( FGrHist 269 ) fr. 12 ; Whitley ( 1998 )). The tradition is supported by the discovery at Praisos of five Eteocretan inscriptions, the earliest of which ( I.Cret . iii .vi. 1 ; cf. 4 ) may date to C6 (Jeffery ( 1990 ) 316 nos. 19 a and b ( 550 -525 ?)). If so, it considerably antedates the earliest identifiably Greek inscription from Praisos ( I.Cret . III.vi. 7 (C3e); Guarducci ( 1942 ) 137 ; Duhoux ( 1982 ) 63 -85 ). Apart from the role of the Praisioi in the Cretan refusal to join the Greek cause against Xerxes, which is suggested by the narrative of Herodotos (Hdt. 7 . 170 -71 ), our evidence for the history of the polis is Heltic. The phrase οasperacuteς κα ηtilde ένφυλος was used to denote a citizen ( I.Cret. iii .iv. 1 (C3e)). The name of one phyle , Φαρκαρίς , preserved in the dating formula of an honorary decree ( I.Cret. iii .vi. 8 (C3 )), is a rare feminine adjectival form of unknown derivation (Jones, POAG 231 ). The territory of Praisos was called ηasper Πραισία ( χώρα ) (Theophr. Hist. pl. 3 . 3 . 4 ; I.Cret . iii .iv. 1 (C3e)). The statement of Ps.-Skylax 47 that 'Praisos reached in both directions' ( Πραισοgraveς διήκει α µ φοτέρωθεν ) has been understood to mean to the north and the south coasts (e.g.Whitley ( 1998 )). Such an interpretation is supported by the decree of Praisos for the Stalitai (and Setaetai ) which suggests that these two coastal communities (the Stalitai on the south coast and Setaetai on the north coast) were dependencies of Praisos during the Heltic period ( I.Cret . iii .vi. 7 (C3f); Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 385 -94 ; Perlman ( 1996 ) 257 -58 ). The polis town of Praisos was built on three acropolises (First Acropolis, Second Acropolis and Third Acropolis or Altar Hill) and covered an area of roughly 24 ha. Settlement began there (on First and Second Acropolises) already in LM iii C and continued through C2s. The main period of occupation was C5l-C2m (Whitley et al . ( 1995 ) 428 ). An early shrine (Geometric-Heltic) was located on the summit of Third Acropolis, and a temple (Classical-Heltic) on the summit of First Acropolis. Staphylos records the existence of a temple of Zeus Diktaios at Praisos (Staphylos ( FGrHist 269 ) fr. 12 ). The question remains open whether this temple should be identified with the one on First Acropolis or with the temple and sanctuary of Zeus Diktaios at Palaikastro on the east coast of Crete (Perlman ( 1995 a )). Extra-urban spring sanctuaries were located to the south of the urban centre at Vavelli (Orientalising-Heltic) and Mesamvrysi (Geometric-Archaic and possibly later). A third extraurban sanctuary (Orientalising-Heltic) with an associated C6s kiln has been identified on the summit of Prophitis Elias, 2 . 5 km south-east of the polis town (Whitley et al . ( 1999 ) 249 -51 ; cf. Erickson ( 2000 ) 318 -27 ). Residential areas are indicated by rock-cut features on the slopes of First and Second Acropolises. A multi-room structure of the Heltic period identified as a house or an andreion was located in the saddle between First and Second Acropolis. If this structure was an andreion (for the identification of the structure as a public building,see Bosanquet ( 1902 ) 259 -70 ), the organisation of Praisos paralleled that of other Cretan poleis whose public buildings occupied the saddle connecting a double acropolis. The main cemetery (Late Geometric-Heltic) was located on the south-eastern slopes of Third Akropolis. For a description of the remains, see Whitley et al . ( 1995 ), ( 1999 ). Praisos struck coins (staters, drachms, hemidrachms) on the Aiginetan standard from C4m (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 197 ( c. 350 -325 )). Staters have types: obv . Gorgoneion, or quadruped suckling a human infant, or Herakles kneeling; rev . (with Gorgoneion and quadruped): Herakles kneeling; rev . (with Herakles): eagle; legend: ΠΡΑΙ , ΠΡΑΙΣ or ΠΡΑΙΣΙ . Drachms have: obv . male figure; rev . Herakles kneeling. Hemidrachms have obv . Herakles kneeling; rev . eagle (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXVII. 1 -10 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl . 539 ). Staters of C4l-C3e (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 197 ) have: (i) obv . head of a goddess (Guarducci ( 1942 ) 137 : Demeter or Persephone?); rev . bull; (ii) obv . Zeus aetophoros ; rev . Herakles standing, or goat protome; (iii) obv . head of Apollo; rev . goat protome (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pls. XXVII. 11 -28 ; XXVIII. 1 -19 ; SNG Cop.Aeg.Isl . 540 ). Drachms, hemidrachms and obols of C4l-C3e have (i) obv . head of a goddess; rev . bull's head (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXVII. 13 -20 ); or (ii) obv . head of Apollo; rev . Herakles standing, or a goat protome, or head of a goat, or a bee (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXVIII. 2 , 5 -11 ); or (iii) obv . head of a goddess; rev . bull's head,or a bee; or ( 4 ) obv . Zeus aetophoros ; rev . goat protome, or Herakles standing (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pls. XXVII. 28 , XXVIII. 1 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl . 541 -43 ).

The toponym is Πρίανσος , οasper ( I.Cret . iv 174 (C3l/C2e)). The city-ethnic is either Πριανσιευacuteς (coins, C4s-C3f, infra ; I.Cret . iii .iii. 4 (C3l/C2e)) or Πριάνσιος ( I.Cret . iii .iii. 4 (C3l/C2e)). For the extraCretan form of the toponym Πρια µ ψός (Delphi, BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 6 ( c. 230 -210 )) and of the city-ethnic Πριάσσιος (Miletos, Milet . i . 3 38 o, q (C3s)), see Bile ( 1988 ) 153 n. 328 . Another extra-Cretan inscription preserves the city-ethnic Πριάνσικος (Pagasai, Thess. Mnem . no. 83 (C3l/C2f)). The earliest reference to Priansos as a polis (in the political sense) occurs in the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 37 ( c. 259 -250 )). The observation that Priansos may have been minting coins as early as c. 330 ( infra ) suggests that the community was a polis in the political sense already in the late Classical period. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the coins ( infra ) and externally in Heltic treaties ( I.Cret . iii .iii. 4 (C3l/C2e); I.Cret . iv 174 (C3l/C2e)). For the individual use of the city-ethnic there are the immigrants from Priansos to Miletos, ' Ορθοκληtildeς Αρίστωνος Πριάσσιος , Αίσι µ ος Αισί µ ου Πριάσσιος and Πυργίας Καλλιδόκου Πριάσσιος ( Milet . i . 3 38 o, q (C3s)) and ' Ερασιπτόλε µ ος [ Πρ ] επάνδρω Πριάνσιος proxenos of Gortyn (no. 960 ) ( I.Cret . iv 208 (C3 /C2 )) and theorodokos for Delphi ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iv . 6 ( c. 230 -210 )). The territory is called ηasper Πριανσία ( I.Cret . iii .iii. 4 , ll. 18 -21 (C3l/C2e)). The Heltic borders of Priansos are described in the alliance of Priansos with Hierapytna and Gortyn ( I.Cret . iv 174 , ll. 16 -30 (C3l/C2e)). The description of the border with Gortyn begins at the south coast, so it seems likely that the Geometric-Roman cave sanctuary of Ειλείθυια Βινατία at Tsoutsouros (ancient Einatos) was located within her territory ( I.Cret . iv 174 . 60 -61 , 76 ; Faure ( 1996 ) 75 -77 ). Einatos (in Linear B wi-na-to, McArthur ( 1993 ) 152 ) may have served as a port for Priansos.Coin types ( infra ) suggest that Priansos was oriented to the sea. The mouth of the river Mintris would seem the likely place to look for an ancient harbour, but no ancient harbour facil- ities are visible today. This may be due to several geological factors, including coastal uplift and riverine silting (personal observation). Nothing is known about the urban centre of Priansos, which was probably located in the vicinity of Kastelliana. A Heltic inscription refers to an andreion at Priansos ( I.Cret. iii .iii. 4 . 38 -40 (C3l/C2e)). In so far as andreia are attested elsewhere on Crete during the Archaic and Classical periods (see Axos, Datala and Eltynia, supra ), it is possible that also at Priansos it was pre-Heltic. Athena Polias, in whose sanctuary public enactments were displayed, was probably the protecting deity of the polis ( I.Cret. iii .iii. 4 . 79 -80 (C3l/C2e)). Priansos struck coins (staters, drachms, hemidrachms) on the Aiginetan standard during the period c. 330 -280 / 270 (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 190 , 198 ; IGCH no. 109 ). Staters have obv . seated goddess with serpent (Svoronos ( 1890 ) 295 : Hygieia?); rev . Poseidon standing holding his trident, or goat protome (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXVIII. 21 -23 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl . 544 -45 ). Drachms and hemidrachms have obv . head of a goddess (Guarducci ( 1935 ) 280 : Artemis?); rev . trident (drachms only), or palm (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXVIII. 24 -28 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl . 546 -47 ). Legend (all denominations): ΠΡΙΑΝΣΙΕΩΝ or abbreviations down to ΠΡΙ ."

The toponym is ' Ραυtildeκος (Ps.Skylax 47 ; Polyb. 30 . 23 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ραυacuteκιος (coins, C4s-C3f, infra ; Milet . i . 3 140 . 36 ( c. 259 -250 )). For ' Ρωκίονς (acc. pl.), which occurs in the asylia decree of Rhaukos for Teos ( I.Cret . i .xxvii. 1 (C3l)), see Bile ( 1988 ) 111 . In Ps.-Skylax 47 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Rhaukos is one of the toponyms listed under the heading πόλεις πολλαιgrave εν Κρήτηsubiotaη . The earliest explicit reference to Rhaukos as a polis , and here in the political sense, occurs in the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 36 ( c. 259 -250 )). Rhaukos was certainly a polis in the political sense during the early Heltic period. The coins, which perhaps began as early as c. 330 ( infra ), suggest that this was already the case in the late Classical period. The collective use of the city-ethnic occurs internally on the C4s-C3f coins ( infra ), and externally in the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 36 ( c. 259 -250 )). For the individual use of the city-ethnic, there are the proxenoi of Iasos, Θεόδωρος Σωτάδα Κρηgraveς ' Ραυacuteκιος ( I.Iasos 53 (C4l/C3e)), and of Gortyn, Λυacuteγδα µ ις Μιττυρίωνος ' Ραυacuteκιος ( I.Cret . iv 206 (C3 /C2 )). The polis town of Rhaukos (modern Ag. Myronas) is almost unknown archaeologically (Pendlebury et al . ( 1932 -33 ) 91 -92 ; Sanders ( 1982 ) 154 ( 9 / 12 )), but a Heltic inscription recording the border of Gortyn and Knosos most likely refers to the agora of Rhaukos and to the prytaneion in the agora ( I.Cret . iv 182 . 3 -4 ( c. 167 / 6 ); Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 296 -300 ). In so far as both terms are attested elsewhere on Crete during the Archaic and Classical periods (agora: see Gortyn (no. 960 ) and Phaistos (no. 980 ); prytaneion : see Lato (no. 971 ), it is possible that also at Rhaukos the agora and the prytaneion are pre-Heltic. Rhaukos struck coins (staters, drachms, hemidrachms) on the Aiginetan standard during the period c. 330 -280 / 270 (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 197 ; IGCH no. 109 ). Staters have obv . Poseidon hippios ; rev . trident-head, within an incuse square on the earliest issues (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXIX. 6 -7 , 11 -16 , 23 -24 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl . 551 ).

987,Rhithymnos (Rhithymnios),Crete,35.2,24.3,539,2755,"987 . Rhithymnos (Rhithymnios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 20 , long. 24 . 30 . Size of territory: 3 . Type: C. The toponym is not attested in the inscriptions from Crete. Inscriptions from elsewhere and literary sources spell the toponym ' Ρίθυ µ νος (Arkesine, IG xii . 7 7 A. 3 (C4l-C3e)), ' Ρίθυ µ να (Delphi, BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 116 ( c. 230 -210 )), and ' Ριθυ µ νία (Steph. Byz. 545 . 7 ). Rhithymnos may have been renamed Arsinoë during the period C3l-C2e (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 242 -45 : reign of Ptolemy IV). The city-ethnic is ' Ριθυacute µ νιος ( I.Cret . i .xxii. 4 A (C3f)). Steph. Byz. 545 . 7 is the only source to identify Rhithymnos as a polis . Aelian called Rhithymnos a κώ µ η (Ael. NA 14 . 20 ). That Rhithymnos was a polis in the political sense during the late Classical and early Heltic periods is suggested by her mint, which may have begun as early as c. 330 ( infra ), by a proxeny decree of C4l-C3e in which a citizen of Rhithymnos is granted proxenia by Arkesine ( IG xii . 7 7 A (C4l-C3e)), and by the personal use of the cityethnic (Perlman ( 1996 ) 246 -52 ; infra ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is not attested, but is undoubtedly to be recognised in the legend ΡΙ which appears on the reverse of the coins ( infra ). For the individual and external use there is the funerary columella of Σώτειρα ∆α µ αρέτου ' Ριθυ µ νία ( IG ii² 10135 (C4 /C3 )) and the proxenoi of Olous, Κλεωναῖος [ ∆α ] µ οκράτους ' Ριθυacute µ νιος ( I.Cret . i .xxii. 4 A (C3f)), and of Gortyn,[---,son of ---] οδόκω ' Ριθυacute µ νιος ( I.Cret . iv 207 (C3 )). The evidence for the history and institutions of Rhithymnos dates to the Heltic period. The remains of ancient Rhithymnos lie concealed beneath those of the Venetian city. For a brief survey of ancient remains in the modern city,see Stratidakis ( 1995 ) 326 -27 . The acropolis was more than likely located on the high promontory where the Venetians later built their fort (Fortetsa). The town and harbour were probably to the east of the promontory; rock-cut slipways and a fish tank have been identified to the west of Fortetsa (Blackman ( 1976 d )). Onorio Belli describes the remains of a square temple with a portico upon a hill in the vicinity of Rhithymnos, but the location of this building is unknown (Falkener ( 1854 ) 25 ). Rhithymnos struck coins (staters, drachms, hemidrachms) on the Aiginetan standard during the period c. 330 -280 / 270 (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 190 , 198 ). Her output was small. Staters have obv . head of Apollo; rev . Apollo lithophoros (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXX. 1 ). Drachms and hemidrachms have obv . head of Athena; rev . trident-head and dolphins (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pls.

988,Rhitten (Rhittenios),Crete,35.0,24.55,761,4221,"988 . *Rhitten (Rhittenios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 00 , long. 24 . 55 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: B. The adverbial ' Ριττενάδε , which occurs in the agreement between the Rhittenioi and Gortyn ( I.Cret . iv 80 (C5e)), indicates that the toponym was either ' Ριττέν or ' Ριζέν (Bile ( 1988 ) 145 , 168 ). The form ' Ριζηνία occurs in Stephanos (Steph. Byz. 544 . 20 ) and has been restored in two inscriptions: (i) a fragment of an Archaic epichoric inscription from Patela Prinias ( I.Cret . i .xxviii. 2 (C6 )) and (ii) an agreement between Gortyn and Knosos ( I.Cret . iv 182 (C2 )). In both cases, the restorations of the toponym are problematic (Faure ( 1993 ) 70 ). The cityethnic was ' Ριττένιος ( I.Cret . iv 80 (C5e)). Only Stephanos refers to *Rhitten (Rhizenia) as a polis (Steph. Byz. 544 . 21 ). The agreement of Gortyn for *Rhitten recognised that the Rhittenioi were αυτόνο µ οι and αυτόδικοι ( I.Cret . iv80 (C5e)).From this same text we learn further that the Rhittenioi enjoyed their own assembly ( τοgrave κοινοgraveν οι ' Ριττένιοι , αγοραgrave Γaltευ µ ένα ), council ( πρείγιστοι ; for the meaning of the term, see Davaras ( 1980 ); Bile ( 1988 ) 341 ), and public officials ( κόσ µ οι , καtildeρυκς ). On the other hand, certain delicts fell under the joint jurisdiction of Gortyn and *Rhitten ( 4 -12 ), and certain complaints against Gortyn and individual Gortynioi were heard in Gortyn ( 12 -15 ). Furthermore, Gortyn owned at least some territory which was occupied by Rhittenioi , and it was within the jurisdiction of Gortyn to determine the rights of those occupants to its use ( 3 -4 ). On balance the evidence suggests that *Rhitten was a polis with her own laws, courts, magistrates, council and assembly, but a dependent polis of Gortyn (which controlled land within the territory of *Rhitten and could under certain circumstances abrogate the judicial and executive authority of the state (Perlman ( 1996 ) 265 -66 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic occurs externally in the agreement of Gortyn and *Rhitten ( I.Cret . iv 80 (C5e)). The location of ancient *Rhitten has been the subject of controversy. Guarducci identified ancient *Rhitten with the remains of the important settlement at Patela Prinias c. 11 km north of Gortyn, and the majority of scholars have followed her lead (Guarducci ( 1935 ) 294 ; van Effenterre ( 1993 ); cf. Nomima i 7 ). Faure has long championed an alternative location for ancient *Rhitten south of the Mesara in the Asterousia mountains near Apesokari at the foot of a chain of hills called ηasper Κάτω /asper Ρίζα (Faure ( 1963 ) 22 -24 , ( 1993 ) 70 ). Faure's arguments against the opinio communis are convincing. His arguments in favour of ηasper Κάτω /asper Ρίζα are somewhat less compelling (Perlman ( 1996 ) 262 -63 ). The ancient site near Apesokari has not been explored, and all that may be said about it is that the surface remains date to the Classical and Heltic periods (Faure ( 1963 ) 24 ). The settlement on Patela Prinias, a high triangular-shaped plateau, c. 11 . 5 ha in area, located at the junction of two valleys which connect the northern and southern coasts, was established in C13 and continued until C6m. Defensive walls have been identified below Patela Prinias restricting access through the valleys and up to the plateau. Residential districts that attest a degree of town-planning have been excavated at the northern edge of the plateau and to the south-east in the vicinity of the two large buildings, Temple A (C7 ) and 'Temple B' (Subminoan/Protogeometric-C7l). Mazarakis Ainian suggests that 'Temple B' was not, in fact, a temple but a public building with some other function,perhaps e.g. a prytaneion , during its final (C7 ) phase (Mazarakis Ainian ( 1997 ) 224 -26 ). The cemetery (also C13 -C6m) was 500 m north-west of Patela at Siderospilia. A potters' quarter (C8l/C7e-C6m) was located near Mandra di Gipari on a hillock opposite the west side of the plateau. During the late Classical and Heltic periods Patela Prinias served as a fortified guard-post. For the remains of the settlement at Patela Prinias, see Rizza ( 1978 ), ( 1991 ), ( 1995 ), ( 2000 ); Rizza and Rizzo ( 1985 ); Rizza et al . ( 1994 )."
989,Stalai (Stalites),Crete,35.05,26.0,448,2402,"989 . Stalai (Stalites) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 05 , long. 26 . 00 . Size of territory: 1 . Type: C. The toponym is attested only in the late form Στηtildeλαι (Steph. Byz. 585 . 12 ). The city-ethnic is Σταλίτης ( I.Cret . iii .vi. 7 (C3f); cf. Στηλίτης , I.Cret . iii .iv. 9 , l. 123 (C2l)). Stalai is identified as a polis in two ancient sources: (i) the decree of Praisos concerning the Stalitai , which secures for the Stalitai the enjoyment of their chora and polis ( I.Cret. iii .vi. 7 (C3f)); and (ii) Stephanos (Steph. Byz. 585 . 12 ). The meaning of the term in the decree of Praisos is urban. This decree indicates that the Stalitai possessed several of the defining characteristics of the polis , viz . an urban centre ( πόλις ), a hinterland ( χώρα ) with recognised borders, the authority to levy harbour taxes ( ελλι µ ένιος ) and perhaps to tax the purple-dye and fishing industries, and so, presumably, the public officials required to levy the taxes and spend or distribute the proceeds. We do not know whether or not in other respects the Stalitai were self-governing and self-regulating, autonomoi and autodikai . On present evidence, Stalai appears to have been a dependent community of Praisos, perhaps a dependent polis , at the time of the decree (Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 161 -68 , 383 -93 ; Perlman ( 1996 ) 257 -58 ; cf. Gschnitzer ( 1975 )). The decree dates to C3f, and one of its provisions specifies that the Stalitai shall give to Praisos a share of the revenue from the fishing industry as they did in the past ( καθάπερ καιgrave πρότερον ). If this revenue was indeed the product of taxation, we may infer that for some time the community exercised public authority in this area. It is not possible to fix precisely for how long this had been the case, but the surface remains of the ancient settlement on Dasonari, which is the most likely location of Stalai (Schachermeyer ( 1938 ) 479 ; Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 386 ), date to the Archaic and Classical periods (autopsy). The evidence suggests that Stalai may have been a polis , albeit perhaps a dependent polis , in the late Classical period, so it is included in the Inventory as a possible polis (type C). The collective use of the city-ethnic occurs externally in the decree of Praisos for the Stalitai ( I.Cret . iii .vi. 7 (C3f)) and in the arbitration of Magnesia for Itanos and Hierapytna ( I.Cret . iii .iv. 9 . 123 (C2l))."
990,Sybrita (Sybritios),Crete,35.15,24.4,892,4849,"990 . Sybrita (Sybritios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 15 , long. 24 . 40 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: [A]. The toponym is Συacuteβριτα (Ps.Skylax 47 ) and is probably attested in Linear A and B as suki-ri-ta (Scafa ( 1994 )). The toponym means 'town of the wild boar' (ibid.). Non-Cretan and late sources transpose υ / ι , Σίβρυτος ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 118 ( c. 230 -210 ); Guarducci ( 1939 ) 289 ). The city-ethnic is Συβρίτιος (coins, C4f, infra ; I.Cret . IV 183 (C3l/C2e)). In Ps.-Skylax 47 , where polis is used in the urban sense, Sybrita is one of the toponyms listed under the heading πόλεις πολλαιgrave εν Κρήτηι . The asylia decree of Sybrita for Teos provides the earliest reference to Sybrita as a polis in the political sense ( I.Cret . ii .xxvi. 1 (C3l)). The collective use of the city-ethnic occurs internally on the coins (C4s, infra ) and externally in a treaty with Gortyn ( I.Cret . iv 183 (C3l/C2e)) and in the asylia decree for Teos ( I.Cret . ii .xxvi. 1 (C3l)). For the individual use there is [---] ποιν Αριστοφόω Συβρίτιος , proxenos of Aptara ( I.Cret . ii .iii. 5 B (C2f)). Very little is known about the history of Sybrita. During the Heltic period Sybrita and Gortyn arranged an alliance ( I.Cret. iv 183 ; Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 267 -70 (C3l/C2e)). Shared coin types have been understood to indicate that these two poleis may have earlier (C4s) joined together in a sympoliteia ( infra ). The acropolis of the polis town of Sybrita, Kephala ( 500 -618 m), appears to have been continuously inhabited from LM iii C (Prokopiou ( 1991 ); D'Agata ( 1999 ); Rocchetti and D'Agata ( 1999 )). Its commanding position dominated the Amari valley, a principal line of communication between the Mesara and the north coast of the island. The construction in C9s of a monumental building (Edificio A 1 , c. 7 m × 7 m) on the southern plateau of Kephala has been understood to reflect a new political organisation of the community, and perhaps the emergence of the polis (Rocchetti and D'Agata ( 1999 ); D'Agata ( 2000 )). At its greatest extent (in the Heltic period) the polis town of Sybrita extended from the acropolis south-west to the villages of Yenna and Ag. Photini and north-east towards the village of Klisidhi. Stretches of defence walls of the Archaic, Heltic and later periods have been identified on the summit and slopes of the acropolis (Kirsten ( 1951 ); Belgiorno ( 1994 )), with gates located on its north-eastern slope (Belgiorno ( 1994 ) 217 . 13 ) and on the south-western slope at Lagou Kharakou (ibid. 218 . 17 ). A temple (Heltic?), perhaps of Dionysos, may be located beneath the small chapel Ekklesia tou Christou on the south-western slope of the acropolis (ibid. 215 . 8 ). The principal residential districts appear to have been situated on the southern and south-western slopes of the acropolis. Three cemeteries have been located: two to the south-west of Kephala near Yenna and a third to the north of Kephala at ta Ellenika. A sanctuary of Hermes Kranaios (LM i -Roman, with gaps) located at Patsos c. 5 km to the south-west of Kephala probably lay within the territory of Sybrita (Kourou and Karetsou ( 1994 )). The Amari valley is very well watered, and there are many springs, cisterns, fountains and artesian wells in the vicinity of ancient Sybrita (Belgiorno ( 1994 ) 224 -25 ). For a survey of material remains in the vicinity of Sybrita, see Belgiorno ( 1994 ); for the Greek-Italian excavations at Thronos Kephala ( 1987 -99 ), see Rocchetti ( 1994 a ); D'Agata ( 1999 ); Rocchetti and D'Agata ( 1999 ); D'Agata (forthcoming, non vidi ). Sybrita struck coins (all denominations) on the Aiginetan standard intermittently during the period c. 380 -280 / 270 (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 196 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) 53 ). The earliest coins (staters, c. 380 ) have obv . Hermes seated; rev . hippocamp within an incuse square; legend: ΣΥΒΡΙΤΙΟΝ written retrograde in the epichoric alphabet (Le Rider ( 1966 ) pl. XXXIV. 19 with p. 196 ). For a short time ( c. 360 / 350 -340 / 330 ) Sybrita minted coins (staters, drachms, hemidrachms) with Gortynian types, perhaps reflecting a sympoliteia or alliance between the two poleis (Le Rider ( 1966 ) 160 -62 ). Staters have: obv . Europa seated in a tree; legend: ΣΥΒΡΙΤΙ written retrograde in the epichoric alphabet on some; rev . bull; legend: ΣΥΒΡΙ written retrograde in the epichoric alphabet on some. Drachms and hemidrachms have obv . head of Europa; rev . head of bull; legend: ΣΥ (Le Rider ( 1966 ) pl. XXVII. 7 -19 ). Later issues of c. 330 -280 / 270 (staters, drachms, obols) have obv . Dionysus (full or head only); rev . Hermes (full or head only); legend (stater): ΣΥΒΡΙΤΙΟΝ or ΣΥΒΡΙΤΙΩΝ (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXX. 12 -18 ; SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl . 560 ). See SNG Cop. Aeg.Isl . 559 for an obol (date?) with obv . goat's head; rev . bunch of grapes; legend: ΣΥ ."
991,Tarrha (Tarrhaios),Crete,35.15,24.0,543,2701,"991 . Tarrha (Tarrhaios) Map 60 . Lat. 35 . 15 , long. 24 . 00 . Size of territory: 2 . Type: B. The toponym is Τάρρα ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) iii . 107 ( c. 230 -210 )). The city-ethnic is Ταρραῖος ( I.Cret . iv 179 ( c. 183 )). Although Tarrha is called a polis in late sources only (Paus. 10 . 16 . 5 ; Steph. Byz. 604 . 6 -8 ), it clearly was a polis in the political sense during the Heltic period, and there is little doubt that the same was true during the Classical period and perhaps even the Archaic. The evidence for this, which includes (i) participation in the C4l-C3federation οιasper /acuteΟρειοι (van Effenterre ( 1948 a ) 119 -27 ; Chaniotis ( 1996 ) 106 -8 , 421 -22 ; cf. Sekunda ( 2000 ) 337 -38 : league founded C3f), (ii) striking coins as early as c. 330 ( infra ), and (iii) the individual use of the city-ethnic (Perlman ( 1996 ) 246 -52 ), recommends its inclusion in the Inventory as a probable polis (type B). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally in abbreviated form on coins ( infra ), and externally in the alliance of the members of the Cretan koinon with Eumenes II ( I.Cret . iv 179 . 8 ( c. 183 )). For the individual use there is the dedication of Πανίδας Ταρραῖ [ ος ] from the sanctuary of Orthia in Sparta ( IG v . 1 252 (C6 ); but cf. BSA 12 ( 1906 ) 353 . 1 ). Tarrha was a member of the C4l-C3federation οιasper /acuteΟρειοι ( supra ). The hillside west of upper Ag. Roumeli at the mouth of the river Tarrhaios and the Samaria Gorge was the site of the main Classical-Heltic settlement of Tarrha (Nixon et al . ( 1990 ) 217 ). The location afforded Tarrha little arable land (Rackham ( 1990 ) 108 -9 ), and it is likely that her inhabitants relied for their livelihood upon the mountains and the sea (for the economic exploitation of Crete's mountains, see Chaniotis ( 1999 ); for bee-keeping and shepherding at Tarrha, see the coin types, infra ; for cedar forests in the mountains around Tarrha, see Theophr. Hist. pl. ii .ii. 2 ; for their exploitation, Perlman ( 1999 ) 146 ). The Church of the Panaghia west of the river is very likely the site of a temple, perhaps that of Apollo, who was probably the protecting deity of the polis (Guarducci ( 1939 ) 305 -6 ; Weinberg ( 1960 )). Archaic (and earlier?) and Classical burials have been found to the west of the river near the modern village (Tzedakis ( 1971 )). On the coast to the east of the river are the remains of a cemetery (C5l and later) and of a Roman seawall (Nixon et al . ( 1990 ) 218 ). Tarrha struck coins (drachms) during the period c. 330 -280 / 270 . Types: obv . head of a goat; legend: ΤΑΡ ; rev . bee (Svoronos ( 1890 ) pl. XXX. 27 , with Le Rider ( 1966 ) 197 -98 )."

The toponym is Τυacuteλισος (ML 42 (C5m)), in Linear B tu-ri-so (McArthur ( 1993 ) 21 -23 ). The city-ethnic is Τυλίσιος (ML 42 (C5m); coins, C4s-C3f, infra ; Milet . i . 3 140 . 36 ( c. 259 -250 )). The agreement of Knosos, Tylisos and Argos provides for the division of booty αι δεgrave συ µ πλέονες πόλιες . . . έλοιεν (ML 42 B. 31 -32 (C5m) = Nomima i 54 . ii ). It is likely that Tylisos should be understood as one of the poleis . The term is used in its political sense. The earliest certain reference to Tylisos as a polis occurs in the agreement of Miletos προgraveς ταgraveς πόλεις ταgraveς εγ Κρήτηι ( Milet . i . 3 140 . 1 , 36 ( c. 259 -250 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on the coins (C4s-C3f, infra ), and externally in the agreement of Knosos, Tylisos and Argos (ML 42 (C5m); ML 42 A (from Tylisos) and B (from Argos) are written in Argolic, and so are treated here as external). For the individual use of the city-ethnic there are ' Ορθότι µ ος Κελαίθου Τυλίσιος , proxenos of Phokis (Daulis?) and Atrax, Thessaly ( IG ix . 1 , 33 . 3 (C3s); SEG 29 502 (C3s)), and /asperacuteΕρ µ ων Τυλίσιος , proxenos of Kydonia ( I.Cret. ii .x. 1 (C3 )). The neighbours of Tylisos were Knosos to the east and Axos to the west. During the Classical period Tylisos and Knosos formed an alliance (ML 42 (C5m)).The assembly of Argos ( τοgrave πλ ˜ εθος ) served as the mediator in the resolution of disputes between the two poleis concerning questions of war and peace (ML 42 A. 6 -17 ; Merrill ( 1991 ); cf. ML 42 : the text implies a federal structure with a federal assembly called τοgrave πλ ˜ εθος which decided questions of war and peace; members included Tylisos, Knosos and Argos and perhaps other states as well ( συ µ πλέονες πολίες , ML 42 B. 31 -32 ); cf. Gschnitzer ( 1958 ) 44 -47 : ML 42 is an alliance between Knosos and Argos; Tylisos is a dependency of Argos). The border between Knosos and Tylisos ( οtildeροι ταtildeς γαtildeς ) is described in this alliance (B 26 -29 ), and regulations concerning property and trade are provided: (i) both poleis are prohibited from absorbing territory ( χ ˜ ορα ) belonging to the other (B 25 -26 ); (ii) Knosioi are prohibited from owning ## II.

The toponym is Βρικίνδηρα , τά (Herod. 2 . 57 ); on the basis of Rhodian Heltic inscriptions such as e.g. SEG 39 808 (C2 ) giving the demotic Βρυγινδάριος , the toponym Βρυγίνδαρα may be assumed. The city-ethnic is Βρικινδάριος ( IG i³ 290 . i . 15 ( 415 / 14 )). Our only source for this community are the Athenian tribute lists in which the Βρικινδάριοι are recorded thrice: in 429 / 8 ( IG i³ 282 . iv . 13 ), amount lost, in 421 / 20 ( IG i³ 285 . i . 103 -4 ), 1 tal., and in 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 15 ), amount lost. The Brikindarioi must have been the inhabitants of Βρυγίνδαρα , a place in the territory of Ialysos (no. 995 ) (Papachristodoulou ( 1989 ) 124 -31 , ( 1999 b ) 37 ). The fact that it paid individually may suggest that it was a dependent polis inside the territory of Ialysos (cf. Hansen ( 1997 ) 31 ), or-considering the sporadic nature of its payments-may suggest civic disorder at Ialysos. Alternatively, the appearance of the Brikindarioi may indicate an arrangement imposed by the Athenians in order to weaken a powerful ally, as all three major poleis must have been.

The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally on C5 coins ( infra ), and externally in Anakreon fr. 4 , Page, and IG i³ 71 . i . 128 ( 425 / 4 ); the individual and external use is found as early as 591 (ML 7 c and g). Ialysos occupied the northernmost part of the island; its territory measured c. 345 km ² . Several second-order settlements within the territory have been surmised on the basis of ceramic surface evidence (Papachristodoulou ( 1989 ) 83 -146 ). Of these, the most significant is located at the foot of the Daphne Hill, a little to the north-west of the acropolis (Inglieri ( 1936 ) foglio nord p. 27 no. 20 ): here rich finds of Classical pottery have been made ( ASAtene 6 -7 ( 1923 -24 ) 326 ); it is not impossible that this site was in fact part of Ialysos proper. Another settlement of moderate size seems to have been situated within that part of Ialysian territory on which later the city of Rhodos (no. 1000 ) was built (Dreliosi- Herakleidou ( 1999 )). At modern Theologos (Tholos) north of the city are remains of a temple dedicated to Apollo Erethimios: it was a Doric temple constructed c. 400 and measuring 7 . 8 × 13 . 10 m;a well in the temenos contained C5 pottery ( ClRh 2 ( 1932 ) 77 -116 ). Near the temple are remains of a C4 theatre with a horseshoe-shaped koilon (ibid.; TGR ii. 281 ). With Halikarnassos (no. 886 ), Kos (no. 499 ), Knidos (no. 903 ), Kamiros (no. 996 ) and Lindos (no. 997 ), Ialysos formed the so-called Dorian hexapolis , later pentapolis , a cultic association centred on the sanctuary of Apollo at Triopion near Knidos (Hdt. 1 . 144 ). Anakreon fr. 4 , Page, has been interpreted as indicating that Polykrates of Samos incorporated Ialysos in his 'empire' (Weiss and Hurter ( 1998 ) 13 ). Ialysos was a member of the Delian League, and was probably among the original members ( ATL iii. 213 ). Ialysos belonged to the Karian district ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 66 ), and is registered in the tribute lists from 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 261 . iv . 13 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 11 ) a total of sixteen times, four times completely restored. Ialysos initially paid a phoros of 10 tal. ( IG i³ 263 . i . 11 , 265 . ii . 27 ; cf. 261 . iv . 13 , 262 . v . 2 , 264 . ii . 37 where this amount is completely restored); in 443 / 2 , the phoros had dropped to 6 tal. ( IG i³ 269 . iv . 10 , partly restored) and remained so until 432 / 1 ( IG i³ 270 . iv . 11 , 271 . ii . 66 , 272 . ii . 89 , 279 . i . 45 , 280 . i . 49 ); in 428 / 7 , 10 tal. was again paid ( IG i³ 283 . iii . 19 ; cf. 284 . 10 ), but in 421 / 20 only 5 tal. was paid ( IG i³ 285 . i . 100 ). Ialysos was assessed for tribute in 424 / 3 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 128 ). In addition, the tribute lists thrice register the Brikindarioi (no. 993 ), the inhabitants of Brikindera, a place in the territory of Ialysos (Papachristodoulou ( 1989 ) 124 -31 ). In 412 / 11 a Peloponnesian squadron arrived at Rhodos invited by some wealthy Rhodians (Thuc. 8 . 44 . 1 ); as a result, Ialysos (with Kamiros and Lindos) defected from the Athenians and joined the Peloponnesians in the war against Athens (Thuc. 8 . 44 . 2 ). Thuc. 8 . 44 . 4 records a payment by the Rhodians to the Peloponnesians of 32 tal., but the share contributed by Ialysos to this amount is unknown. An attempt to undo the new alliance with the Lakedaimonians shortly after was quelled by a squadron commanded by the Ialysian exile Dorieus (Diod. 13 . 38 . 5 , 45 . 1 ; Gehrke, Stasis 133 -34 ). The presumption is that in 411 a democratic constitution was replaced by an oligarchy and that the following neoterismos (Diod.) was an attempt to bring the democrats back into power. According to Diod. 13 . 75 . 1 , in 408 the inhabitants of Ialysos (and Kamiros and Lindos) µ ετΩsubiotaωκίσθησαν εις µ ίαν πόλιν τήν νυtildeν καλου µ ένην ' Ρόδον , a process which Strabo 14 . 2 . 10 refers to by the verb συνοικίζειν . As in numerous other cases, only part of the population was transferred to the new urban centre, and it is clear that a wholesale relocation of the Ialysian population was not carried out (Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 188 -89 ). Furthermore, there appears to be no good reason for the idea that the foundation of Rhodos town was accompanied by a fundamental restructuring of the political organisation of the island (ibid. 189 -90 ): the move towards pan-Rhodian unity had begun long before 408 (ibid. 180 -87 ), and the three old poleis continued to exist (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 25 ; Ps.-Skylax 99 ) and function as poleis after 408 (Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 192 -95 ): c. 394 , citizens of Ialysos were appointed proxenoi by Athens as their father had been (Walbank ( 1978 ) no. 72 ; SEG 28 48 ; cf. Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 192 with n. 91 ), and Heltic and later inscriptions describe Ialysos as a polis both in the urban ( IG xii . 1 677 . 16 ( c. 300 )) and the political ( IG xii . 1 58 . 21 (Roman)) senses, and the former inscription attests to the existence of a council ( οιasper µ αστροί ) and an assembly ( έδοξε . . . ' Ιαλυσίοις ). However, Ialysos was now a subordinate polis inside the polis of Rhodos, and constituted a phyle ( ' Ιαλυσία ; Maiuri, Nuova silloge 19 . i . 6 ( c. 200 ); cf. BCH 99 ( 1975 ) p. 97 col.B. 26 -27 (C3 )) of the Rhodian polis ; see Jones, POAG 243 -44 . In the Heltic period, a system of Ialysian demes is attested, as is the employment of demotics as the third part of personal names ( IG xii . 1 166 ). By analogy with Kamiros and Lindos, where such systems are known to have existed in C4l, it may be assumed that it existed in Ialysos by that time as well. The existence of a Ialysian navy may be inferred from Diod. 13 . 70 . 2 (r 408 ) (Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 182 ). The acropolis, presumably located outside the city proper, was called Achaïa polis ( IG xii . 1 677 . 14 ( c. 300 ); Ergias ( FGrHist 513 ) fr. 1 ; Diod. 5 . 57 . 6 ). It was situated on the summit of Mt.Phileremos.The main architectural structure was the temple of Athena Polias and Zeus Polieus ( Suppl. Epigr. Rh . i no. 54 (no date)). In their present form the remains of the Doric temple are C4l, but a limited number of architectural members and roof-tiles attest to the existence of a C6 predecessor (Livadiotti and Rocco ( 1999 )); a rich deposit to the south of the temple contained votive offerings dating from C9 to C5 (Maiuri ( 1928 )). The location of the urban centre of Ialysos can be inferred from IG xii . 1 677 . 15 ( c. 300 ), from which it appears that it was situated near the acropolis (Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 204 n. 87 ). However, the archaeological evidence for the city is scarce, and the urban history of the polis thus poorly known. In C5f the Diagorids of Ialysos (cf. Paus. 4 . 24 . 2 ) and Diagoras himself won several Olympic victories (e.g. Olympionikai 252 , 287 , 299 , 300 ); Diagoras himself was periodonikes (Knab ( 1934 ) no. 9 ); the victors are described, however,not as Ialysians but as Rhodians ( IvO 151 -52 ; Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 184 ); but some Diagorids participated as citizens of their new polis , Thourioi ( Olympionikai 322 , 356 ), where Dorieus settled after his exile (Xen. Hell . 1 . 5 . 19 ). Attested cults include those of Athena Polias and Zeus Polieus ( Suppl. Epigr. Rh . 54 . 5 i (undated)) and Alektrona (Michel 434 (C4 -C3 )). Ialysos began issuing coins in C6s and struck in both electrum and silver. The earliest silver coins are possibly the so-called palmette staters (anepigraphic) on the 'Ialysian standard' and their fractions (on the Aiginetan standard: Bresson ( 1981 ) 221 ), which have been attributed to Ialysos and dated c. 540 -530 : obv . palmette; rev . two incuse rectangles separated by a broad band, a type used also at Kamiros (no. 996 ) and Lindos (no. 997 ) (Bresson ( 1981 ); Weiss and Hurter ( 1998 ) 13 -14 ). The main issue is a series of electrum fractions and silver staters with thirds and minor fractions, beginning c. 520 and continuing into C5 , and apparently struck to the same individual, Ialysian, standard as the palmette coins: obv . forepart of winged boar sometimes with symbol beneath; rev . eagle's head in dotted and incuse square with floral ornament in corner; legend: ΙΕΛΥΣΙΟΝ or ΙΑΛΥΣΙΟΝ (sometimes on both obv . and rev .; sometimes retrograde), sometimes no legend. Minor silver fractions struck after 479 depict ( 1 ) obv . forepart of winged boar to r.; rev . helmeted head of goddess (Athena?); anepigraphic but 'Gef. in Rhodos' ( SNG von Aulock 2777 -78 ); weight 1 . 37 g, 1 . 40 g = diobol?; ( 2 ) obv . forepart of winged horse; rev . rose in dotted and incuse square; legend: ΙΑ (retrograde); a similar obv . occurs on contemporary coins of Kamiros and Lindos (Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 182 ).

(Babelon, Traité ii. 1 no. 105 catalogues an Archaic electrum coin of Ialysos which he interprets as an obol on the Aiginetan standard; but this coin is now considered a forgery (information kindly provided by M.Amandry).) Pind. Ol . 7 . 73 ff relates the foundation myth of the three Rhodian poleis (they were founded by descendants of Helios) and names the eponymous hero of Ialysos."
996,Kamiros (Kamireus),Rhodes,36.2,27.55,2124,10384,"996 . Kamiros (Kamireus) Map 60 . Lat. 36 . 20 , long. 27 . 55 . Size of territory: 4 ( c. 265 km ² ). Type:A.The local Doric form of the toponym is Κά µ ιρος ( Tit. Cam . 109 . 16 (C4l); cf. Tit. Cam . 103 . 4 (C5 )), οasper (Hom. Il . 2 . 656 ) or ηasper (Diod. 5 . 59 . 3 ); Κά µ ειρος is found in Hom. Il . 2 . 656 and Thuc. 8 . 44 . 2 ; Κα µ ειρίς , ηasper is found in Dieuchidas ( FGrHist 485 ) fr. 7 , possibly as the name of the territory. The city-ethnic is Κα µ ιρευacuteς (C5 coins ( infra ); IG i³ 269 . iv . 11 ( 443 / 2 )) or Κα µ ερευacuteς ( IG i³ 290 . i . 10 ( 415 / 14 )); Κα µ ειρευacuteς is found in Diod. 5 . 55 . 2 . Kamiros is called a polis both in the urban sense (Thuc. 8 . 44 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 99 ) and in the political sense (Hdt. 1 . 144 . 3 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally on C5 coins ( infra ) and in Tit. Cam . 105 . 7 (C4f), and externally in IG i³ 269 . iv . 11 ( 443 / 2 ). For the individual and external use, see Peisandros, an epic poet of C7 -C6 , mentioned by schol. Pind. Ol . 3 . 50 b and Paus. 2 . 37 . 4 . The name of the territory was Κα µ ειρίς (Dieuchidas ( FGrHist 485 ) fr. 7 ); it measured c. 265 km ² . Apart from the Classical settlement at Kymisala in the western extremity of the territory (Maiuri ( 1916 ); Hope Simpson and Lazenby ( 1973 ) 146 ), no second-order settlement has been located, but various cemeteries are dispersed in the vicinity of Kamiros town, and they suggest that such settlements may have existed. The most significant of these cemeteries is at the locality Makri Longoni by the sea; here 260 tombs dating from C7 to C6 have been excavated (Jacopi ( 1929 -30 ) esp. 10 and fig. 3 ; Gates ( 1983 ) 21 -22 ); this site may have formed a part of the city of Kamiros proper. Kamiran authority extended beyond the territory on the island itself: ( 1 ) in addition to the islets near the coast, Kamiros had by C4l incorporated the island of Chalke; in C4m, Chalke appears as a community, probably a polis (no. 477 ), concluding what was presumably a treaty of isopoliteia with Knidos (no. 903 ) ( I.Knidos 605 ; cf. Gawantka ( 1975 ) 209 n. 11 and 38 n. 79 ), whereas in Theophr. Hist. pl . 8 . 2 . 9 it is called a νηtildeσος ' Ροδίων and had become a Kamiran deme, though apparently one with a certain degree of independence ( Tit. Cam . 109 (C4l)); ( 2 ) Kamiran territory, subdivided into demes, existed by C4l in the peraia ( Tit. Cam . 109 . 1 -5 ). With Halikarnassos (no. 886 ), Kos (no. 499 ), Knidos (no. 903 ), Ialysos (no. 995 ) and Lindos (no. 997 ), Kamiros formed the so-called Dorian hexapolis , later pentapolis , a cultic association centred on the sanctuary of Apollo at Triopion near Knidos (Hdt. 1 . 144 ). Kamiros was a member of the Delian League, and was probably among the original members ( ATL iii. 213 ). Kamiros belonged to the Karian district ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 69 ) and is registered in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 8 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 10 ) a total of sixteen times, twice completely restored. Kamiros initially paid a phoros of 9 tal. ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 8 , 262 . ii . 15 , 263 . i . 13 , 265 . i . 9 ); in 443 / 2 the phoros paid was 6 tal. ( IG i³ 269 . iv . 11 ), and so it remained (cf. IG i³ 271 . ii . 69 , 280 . i . 48 ) until 10 tal. was paid in 416 / 15 ( IG i³ 289 . i . 34 ). Kamiros was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 123 ). In 412 / 11 a Peloponnesian squadron arrived at Rhodos invited by some wealthy Rhodians (Thuc. 8 . 44 . 1 ); as a result, Kamiros (with Ialysos and Lindos) defected from the Athenians and joined the Peloponnesians in the war against Athens (Thuc. 8 . 44 . 2 ). Thuc. 8 . 44 . 4 records a payment by the Rhodians to the Peloponnesians of 32 tal., but the share contributed by Kamiros to this amount is not known. An attempt to undo the new alliance with the Lakedaimonians shortly after was quelled by a squadron commanded by the Ialysian exile Dorieus (Diod. 13 . 38 . 5 , 45 . 1 ; Gehrke, Stasis 133 -34 ). The presumption is that in 411 a democratic constitution was replaced by an oligarchy and that the following neoterismos (Diod.) was an attempt to bring the democrats back into power. According to Diod. 13 . 75 . 1 , in 408 the inhabitants of Kamiros (and Ialysos and Lindos) µ ετΩsubiotaωκίσθησαν εις µ ίαν πόλιν τηgraveν τυtildeν καλου µ ένην ' Ρόδον , a process which Strabo 14 . 2 . 10 refers to by the verb συνοικίζειν . As in numerous other cases, only part of the population was transferred to the new urban centre, and it is clear that a wholesale relocation of the Kamiran population was not carried out (Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 188 -89 ). Furthermore, there appears to be no good reason for the idea that the foundation of Rhodos town was accompanied by a fundamental restructuring of the political organisation of the island (ibid. 189 -90 ): the move towards pan-Rhodian unity had begun long before 408 (ibid. 180 -87 ), and the three old poleis continued to exist (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 25 ; Ps.-Skylax 99 ) and function as poleis after 408 : council, assembly and officials are attested in Kamiros in C4f ( Tit. Cam . 106 ; cf. Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 192 -95 ), and the civic mint may have continued to function somewhat beyond 408 (Babelon, Traité ii. 2 . 1008 ad no. 1681 ). However, Kamiros was now a subordinate polis inside the polis of Rhodos (no. 1000 ), and constituted a phyle ( Κα µ ιρίς ; Tit. Cam . 21 . 6 (C2 )) of the Rhodian polis ; see Jones, POAG 243 -44 . The existence of a Kamiran navy may be inferred from Diod. 13 . 70 . 2 (r 408 ) (Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 182 ). By C4l, Kamiros had a system of territorial demes subdivided into ktoinai , and demotics were used as the third part of a citizen's name ( Tit. Cam . 110 . 1 -2 (C2 ); see further Gabrielsen ( 1997 ) 29 -31 , 151 -54 ); a system of patrai may also go back to C4 (ibid. 146 -49 ). A number of local Kamiran phylai (of which the name of one (Althaimenis) is attested in C3e) in all likelihood also go back to the Classical period ( Tit. Cam . 1 b. 10 ; Gabrielsen ( 1997 ) 146 ). However,nothing is known about the functions of these various divisions. The eponymous official was a damiourgos ( Tit. Cam . 105 (C4f); Sherk ( 1990 ) 280 ). The council, called οιasper µ αστροί , is attested in Tit. Cam . 105 . 6 (C4f), restored. The office of prytanis is attested in a C5 inscription ( Tit. Cam . 103 ); he seems inter al . to have been in charge of the construction of a public building ( επεστέγασσε ). A board of hiaropoioi and a tamias are attested by Tit. Cam . 104 (C4 ); a board of epistatai is attested by Tit. Cam . 105 . 6 (C4f). The assembly, called εκκλησία , is attested in Tit. Cam . 105 . 26 -27 (C4f). A C5enactment records a grant of ateleia ( Tit. Cam . 103 . 3 ). A public loan contracted by the polis possibly as early as C5m is attested by Tit. Cam . 105 (C4f). According to Thuc. 8 . 44 . 2 , Kamiros was unwalled ( ateichistos ) in 412 / 11 , and it may have remained unfortified until the Heltic period (cf. Tit. Cam . 110 . 19 ff (C2 )). The town of Kamiros has been partially excavated. The areas known consist of three parts: a public area (agora), the residential area and the acropolis. In its present form, almost the entire public area dates to the Heltic period or later; however, the monumental fountain house in the midst of the agora may have a Classical predecessor; a sanctuary of Apollo Pythios has produced Archaic and Classical finds (Konstantinopoulos ( 1986 ) 173 , 175 -76 ). The few preHeltic remains of the residential area indicate a rather unplanned urban area (ibid. 172 -73 ). Right above the residential area is the Kamiran acropolis,on which the temple of Athena Polias and Zeus Polieus was situated: in its present form the temple (a Doric tetrastyle with east-west orientation) is of Heltic date; however, the existence of a predecessor is indicated by various remains of the Archaic and Classical periods (Jacopi ( 1932 -33 ) 223 -29 ). A large rectangular cistern ( 17 . 40 × 10 . 20 × 3 . 2 m) from the Archaic period was positioned in an east-west orientation immediately to the south of the temple; its capacity was 600 m ³ (ibid. 229 ). At a distance of c. 300 m from the city is a small coastal settlement whose origin dates to the Archaic period and which is believed to have been the port of Kamiros; it is situated at the promontory Mylantia Akra in the area of modern Ag. Menas; about halfway between this site and the town are the remains of a possibly Archaic temple and other buildings (Konstantinopoulos ( 1971 ) 42 ). Attested cults include those of Athena ( Tit. Cam . 104 . 3 , 109 . 10 (C4 )), Athena Polias ( Tit. Cam . 148 (C3 )), Zeus Polieus ( Tit. Cam . 15 . 8 (C3f)) and Apollo ( Suppl. Tit. Cam . 115 a (C6 )). Kamiros began striking anepigraphic electrum and silver coins on the Aiginetan standard in C6 . Denominations: 1 / 24 stater (electrum); stater, drachm, hemidrachm, tritemorion, hemiobol (silver). Types: obv . fig leaf; rev . incuse square, on silver issues divided into two compartments (a type used also at Lindos (no. 997 ) and Ialysos (no. 995 ), if the attribution of the palmette coins to Ialysos is accepted, cf. supra 1200 ). In C5 , silver and bronze coins were struck. Denominations: stater, trihemiobol, obol. Silver types: obv . fig leaf; rev . two oblong incuses, on staters separated by a broad band; legends: ΚΑ , ΚΑΜΙΡΕΩΝ (stater, trihemiobol); or obv . rose; rev . griffin's hed in incuse square; legend: ΚΑ (obol). Bronze types: obv . fig leaf; rev . ΚΑ in two quarters of a wheel. Some minor silver fractions struck after 479 depict obv . forepart of horse; rev . fig leaf in incuse square; legends: ΚΑ , ΚΑΜΙ ; a similar obv . occurs on contemporary coins of Ialysos and Lindos (Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 182 ). A tetartemorion (Babelon, Traité ii. 2 no. 1681 ) shows obv . head of Helios, radiate; rev . head of griffin; legend: ΚΑ , and is on the Chian-Rhodian standard, which suggests that 'l'atelier de Camiros ne fut pas fermé tout de suite après la fondation de Rhodes' .

997,Lindos (Lindios),Rhodes,36.05,28.05,3014,14819,"997 . Lindos (Lindios) Map 60 . Lat. 36 . 05 , long. 28 . 05 . Size of territory: 5 ( c. 790 km ² ). Type: A. The toponym is Λίνδος (Hom. Il . 2 . 656 ; IG i³ 269 . iv . 18 ( 443 / 2 ); I.Lindos 13 (before 411 or later)), ηasper (Callim. Aet . fr. 7 . 20 ). The city-ethnic is Λίνδιος (C6 -C5 coins ( infra ); IG i³ 71 . i . 120 ( 425 / 4 ); I.Lindos 13 ). Lindos is called a polis both in the urban sense (Thuc. 8 . 44 . 2 ; Ps.-Skylax 99 ) and in the political sense (Hdt. 1 . 144 . 3 ); akropolis is found in FGrHist 532 D. 1 (r 490 ). Damosios is found in I.Rhod.Per . 251 . 6 -7 ( 440 -420 ). Politai is found in FGrHist 532 D. 1 (r 490 ). The internal collective use of the city-ethnic is found on C6 -C5 coins ( infra ) and in I.Lindos 13 and 15 -16 App . (all before 411 ?). The external collective use of the ethnic is found in IG i³ 71 . i . 120 ( 425 / 4 ), 269 . iv . 12 ( 443 / 2 ) and Hdt. 7 . 153 . 1 (r 689 / 8 ); the external individual use is found in Pl. Prt . 343 A; IG i³ 1454 A. 38 ( 445 -430 ); and possibly I.Knidos 623 (C4f). The territory of Lindos on Rhodos itself measured c. 790 km ² . In it were situated several second-order settlements, among which the following are worth noting. At Kattabia, in the south-western part of the territory, an inland settlement is indicated by an Archaic (and later) burial ground (Inglieri ( 1936 ) foglio sud p. 69 no. 87 ). On the coast south of Lindos, remains of two Archaic settlements have been located, one at Kiotari and another, at Plimmiti further south, at Germatas, where the settlement seems to have been fortified; neither of these sites has been excavated (Konstantinopoulos ( 1972 ) 24 -25 ). Finally, and most conspicuously, there is Vroulia, at the southernmost tip of the island. The settlement there was founded ab novo c. 700 ; parts of the settlement have fallen into the sea, but the preserved remains consist of a fortification wall separating the settlement from a cemetery to the north-east; inside the settlement are remains of two rows of houses and a small sanctuary with a naiskos ; to the west is an unbuilt area. The settlement was abandoned in C6e. See further Kinch ( 1914 ); Drerup ( 1969 ); and Melander ( 1988 ). Furthermore, Lindian territory extended to parts of the peraia already in C4 : this is shown by I.Lindos 51 .c ii . 17 ( c. 325 ), a catalogue of donors arranged by demes and including the deme of the Φυacuteσκιοι known to have been located at Physkos in the peraia (Fraser and Bean ( 1954 ) 57 , 66 -67 ). With Halikarnassos (no. 886 ), Kos (no. 499 ), Knidos (no. 903 ), Ialysos (no. 995 ) and Kamiros (no. 996 ), Lindos formed the so-called Dorian hexapolis , later pentapolis , a cultic association centred on the sanctuary of Apollo at Triopion near Knidos (Hdt. 1 . 144 ). According to the Lindian Temple Chronicle ( FGrHist 532 D. 1 ), Lindos was besieged in 490 by a Persian force under Datis; the siege was unsuccessful and ended in the conclusion of a treaty of philia . Lindos was a member of the Delian League, and was probably among the original members ( ATL iii. 213 ). Lindos belonged to the Karian district ( IG i³ 271 . ii . 74 ), and is registered in the tribute lists from 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 6 ) to 415 / 14 ( IG i³ 290 . i . 8 ) a total of fifteen times, once completely restored. Lindos initially paid a phoros of 8 tal., 2 , 700 dr. ( IG i³ 259 . iv . 6 ; cf. 261 . iv . 14 where this amount is completely restored); in 448 / 7 it paid 10 tal. ( IG i³ 264 . ii . 11 ; cf. 265 . i . 53 , where this amount is restored); in 445 / 4 -440 / 39 it paid 6 tal. ( IG i³ 267 . iii . 21 , 269 . iv . 12 , 270 . iv . 25 , 271 . ii . 74 , 272 . ii . 68 ); in 433 / 2 and 432 / 1 it paid 10 tal. ( IG i³ 279 . i . 19 , 280 . i . 51 ), but in 421 / 0 and again in 415 / 14 15 tal. ( IG i³ 285 . i . 97 , 290 . i . 8 ). Lindos was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . i . 120 ), and there was a speech by Antiphon περιgrave τουtilde Λινδίων φόρου (frr. 25 -33 , Thalheim). In addition, the tribute lists registered two other groups connected with Lindos: (i) the Λινδίων Οιιαtildeται (no. 998 ) and (ii) the Πεδι ˜ ες (no. 999 ). In 412 / 11 a Peloponnesian squadron arrived at Rhodos invited by some wealthy Rhodians (Thuc. 8 . 44 . 1 ); as a result, Lindos (with Ialysos (no. 995 ) and Kamiros (no. 996 )) defected from the Athenians and joined the Peloponnesians in the war against Athens (Thuc. 8 . 44 . 2 ). Thuc. 8 . 44 . 4 records a payment by the Rhodians to the Peloponnesians of 32 tal., but the share contributed by Lindos to this amount is unknown. An attempt to undo the new alliance with the Lakedaimonians shortly after was quelled by a squadron commanded by the Ialysian exile Dorieus (Diod. 13 . 38 . 5 , 45 . 1 ; Gehrke, Stasis 133 -34 ). The presumption is that in 411 a democratic constitution was replaced by an oligarchy and that the following neoterismos (Diod.) was an attempt to bring the democrats back into power. I.Lindos 13 is a treaty of unknown nature between Lindos and Cretan Lyktos (no. 974 ), traditionally dated prior to 411 , though it could well be later. According to Diod. 13 . 75 . 1 , in 408 the inhabitants of Lindos (and Ialysos and Kamiros) µ ετΩsubiotaωκίσθησαν εις µ ίαν πόλιν τηgraveν νυtildeν καλου µ ένην ' Ρόδον , a process which Strabo 14 . 2 . 10 refers to by the verb συνοικίζειν . As in numerous other cases, only part of the population was transferred to the new urban centre, and it is clear that a wholesale relocation of the Lindian population was not carried out (Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 188 -89 ). Furthermore, there appears to be no good reason for the idea that the foundation of Rhodos town was accompanied by a fundamental restructuring of the political organisation of the island (ibid. 189 -90 ): the move towards pan-Rhodian unity had begun long before 408 (ibid. 180 -87 ), and the three old poleis continued to exist (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 25 ; Ps.-Skylax 99 ) and function as poleis after 408 (for Lindos, see Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 192 with n. 87 ), although Lindos was now a dependent polis inside the polis of Rhodos (no. 1000 ) and constituted a phyle , Λινδία ( BCH 99 ( 1975 ) p. 97 col. A. 8 -9 (C3 ); Suppl. Epigr. Rh. i 18 . 8 (C2f)) of the Rhodian polis ; see Jones, POAG 243 -44 . The existence of a Lindian navy may be inferred from Diod. 13 . 70 . 2 (r 408 ) (Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 182 ). Hoplites are attested by I.Rhod.Per . 251 . 33 ( 440 -420 ); they seem to have received misthos for service (ll. 4 -9 ). Stratagoi are attested in I.Rhod.Per . 251 . 40 ( 440 -420 ). I.Lindos 15 (before 411 ) is a grant of proxeny (with ateleia , etc.) by Lindos to a man of unknown origin; I.Lindos 16 App . is a similar grant of similar date to a man described as 'living in Aigyptos' , presumably in Naukratis (no. 1023 ) (cf. εν τῶ [ ι ] ' Ελλανίωι , ll. 17 -18 ). A C6 tyranny by Kleoboulos is reported in later sources; he is known to have waged war in Lykia ( FGrHist 532 . 23 ), but apart from that nothing substantial is known of his rule (Berve ( 1967 ) 119 -20 , 588 -89 ). Democracy seems implied by C5s enactment formulas ( infra ). The existence of a system of demes and the practice of using demotics as the third part of personal names is attested by two inscriptions dating from c. 325 ( I.Lindos 51 ; IG xii . 1 761 ). The demes were territorial divisions and probably subdivided into ktoinai (Gabrielsen ( 1997 ) 29 -31 , 151 -54 ).About the functions of these units nothing is known. The eponymous official was the priest of Athena Lindia (Sherk ( 1990 ) 281 -83 ). The assembly ( damos ) is attested by I.Lindos 16 App . 2 (before 411 ; cf. I.Lindos 23 . 3 : ψαφ [ ί ] ζωνται Λίνδιοι ( c. 400 )). The council, βωλά , is securely attested by I.Rhod. Per . 251 . 16 -17 , 35 ( 440 -420 ) and I.Lindos 16 App . 1 (before 411 ); it was probouleutic ( έδοξε ταtildeι βωλαtildeι καιgrave τῶι δά µ ωι : I.Lindos 16 App . 1 -2 ; cf. I.Rhod.Per . 251 of 440 -420 , where the same enactment formula has been restored). I.Rhod.Per . 251 . 26 -27 ( 440 -420 ) attests to the existence of prytaneis holding office for a month, and so presumably a committee of the council.A grammateus ( I.Lindos 16 App . 3 , before 411 ) and a board of epistatai ( I.Rhod.Per . 251 . 2 and 20 ( 440 -420 )), of the council or of the assembly, are also attested.The earliest surviving public enactment is I.Rhod.Per . 251 ( 440 -420 ), an enactment by the council and assembly concerning the cult of Enyalios. The city of Lindos was situated by the southern peninsula delineating the bay of Megalos Gialos on the western coast of the island. The ancient town lies beneath its modern successor and is thus virtually unknown, with the exception of a small rock-cut theatre, possibly of C4 date,which occupies part of the south-eastern slope of the acropolis and has an estimated capacity of c. 1 , 800 -2 , 000 (Dyggve ( 1960 ) 406 -7 ; see also TGR ii. 279 ). On the plateau of the steep rock formation rising above the city was the Lindian acropolis (called ακρόπολις in ( FGrHist 532 ) D. 1 (r 490 )). It served as a place of refuge in 490 and was besieged by the Persians under Datis (( FGrhist 532 ) D. 1 : cf. Dyggve ( 1960 ) 51 -52 ). The most important feature of the acropolis was the temple of Athena Lindia, whose cult is assumed to have been instituted by C8 (Konstantinopoulos ( 1972 ) 32 ). The earliest known temple is C6 , but in its present form the structure is Heltic (Dyggve ( 1960 )). The Archaic temple was a Doric amphiprostyle (or prostyle: Gruben ( 1986 ) 414 ) with four columns at each end and situated within a walled temenos approached by a long staircase (Dyggve ( 1960 ) 112 -26 , 365 , 463 with fig. II. 1 at 44 ; Konstantinopoulos ( 1986 ) 180 fig. 203 ). Having been destroyed by fire (cf. Blinkenberg, I.Lindos cols. 198 -200 ), the temple was rebuilt in C4 on a similar plan but with the addition of monumental propylaia entered by a 21 m-wide staircase (Dyggve ( 1960 ) 126 -30 ; Konstantinopoulos ( 1986 ) fig. 205 ). North-east of the acropolis, on the rocky plateau of Vigli, clearly visible from the acropolis, was the Boukopion , an Archaic sanctuary consisting of a grotto on top of which was a small temple whose dedicatee divinity is unknown; the temple is Archaic, but its precise date is disputed (Dyggve ( 1960 ) 459 -63 ); rock-cut inscriptions at the sanctuary date from C6 onwards ( I.Lindos 580 -612 ). In the Heltic period, a group of citizens described as µ ατρόξενοι (or as being µ ατροgraveς ξένας ) is commonly encountered in inscriptions; matroxenoi were full citizens though their mothers were of foreign extraction (Morelli ( 1955 ); Hannick ( 1976 ); Gabrielsen ( 1992 ) 48 n. 7 ). An inscription of c. 325 shows that the group of matroxenoi existed already in C4 ( I.Lindos 51 .c i . 26 -27 : [ Σ ] ωσικ [ λ ] ηtildeς Κοσ µ οκλέος [ µ ατροgraveς δ ] εgrave ξένας , in a list of donors arranged by demes); the implication is that a group of free foreign women married to Lindian citizens resided in the community. I.Rhod.Per . 251 . 26 ( 440 -420 ), refers to the month Artamitios, and, prior to the synoecism of Rhodos city, Lindos-as well as Ialysos and Kamiros-may have had its own individual calendar (Trümpy, Monat . 168 ). Anundated communal dedication by Lindos in Delphi is mentioned in Paus. 10 . 18 . 4 (Jacquemin ( 1999 ) no. 336 ). The chief divinity of Lindos was Athena Lindia, in whose sanctuary state documents were published ( I.Lindos 16 App . 9 -10 (before 411 )); the sanctuary was also of wider, panRhodian importance: documents of Kamiros were deposited there ( Tit. Cam . 105 . 16 (C4e)) and a copy-inscribed in golden letters-of Pind. Ol . 7 , celebrating an Olympic victory by Diagoras of Ialysos, was deposited there as well (Gorgon of Rhodos ( FGrHist 515 ) fr. 18 ; on Athena Lindia, see Morelli ( 1959 ) 80 -86 ). Zeus Polieus is attested by I.Lindos 56 .B ( 313 -275 ); Apollo Pythios by I.Lindos 61 a. 3 ( c. 308 ); a cult of Enyalios is attested by I.Rhod.Per . 251 ( 440 -420 ). Other attested cults include those of Athena Apotropaia ( Nuovo Supplemento Epigr. Rh. 20 (C4 )), Zeus ( I.Lindos 26 . 2 ( c. 400 )), Zeus Polieus ( I.Lindos 56 ( c. 313 )), Apollo ( I.Lindos 57 C ( c. 313 )), Enyalios ( I.Rhod.Per . 251 ( 440 -420 )), and Hermes ( I.Lindos 20 ( c. 400 )). Lindos began issuing coins in C6 and continued minting down to at least 408 ; the earliest issues included small electrum coins (Head, HN ² 637 ; cf. J. Hirsch Auct. xiii 4002 -3 ) and silver already in C6 . The types are obv . lion's head with open jaws and tuft of hair on forehead; rev . incuse square divided into two oblong halves by broad band (a type used also at Kamiros (no. 996 ) and Ialysos (no. 995 ); if the attribution of the palmette coins to Ialysos is accepted; cf. supra 1200 ); some coins are anepigraphic, but when present the legend is Λ , ΛΙΝ∆Ι (sometimes retrograde:Babelon, Traité ii. 1 no. 779 ; Fried ( 1987 ) no. 46 ) or ΛΙΝ∆ΙΟΝ (Babelon, Traité ii. 1 no. 781 ; Cahn ( 1957 ) 22 ). The silver coins were struck, according to Babelon, first on the Milesian standard ( Traité ii. 1 . 475 -78 : staters and diobols; cf. Cahn ( 1957 ) 25 ), later on the Aiginetan ( Traité ii. 2 . 1011 -12 : diobols and hemiobols). After 479 , Lindos struck minor silver fractions with types: obv . forepart of a horse; rev . lion's head within incuse square; legend: ΛΙΝ∆Ι ; similar obverse types were employed by Ialysos and Kamiros (Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 182 ). Head, HN ² ; Babelon, Traité ii. 1 . 473 -78 and ii. 2 :. 1011 -12 ; SNG Cop. Caria 720 -22 , Suppl . 356 ; Cahn ( 1957 ). According to Hdt. 7 . 153 . 1 , Lindos founded the colony Gela (no. 17 ) in Sicily (see also Thuc. 6 . 4 . 3 , reporting that the original site of Gela town was called Λίνδιοι ; cf. FischerHansen ( 1996 ) 321 -22 ); Thuc. 6 . 4 . 3 reports that Cretans also participated in the foundation of Gela in 689 / 8 (see further Gela (no. 17 )). In addition,Lindos is claimed by later authors to have been the founder of Phaselis (no. 942 ) in Lykia in 691 / 0 (Philostephanos, FHG iii 29 ; Aristainetos ( FGrHist 771 ) fr. 1 ); but this tradition is not beyond suspicion. The oecist was supposedly Lakios (Aristainetos ( FGrHist 771 ) fr. 1 ; Ath. 297 E-298 A), a native of either Lindos or Argos (Philostephanos, FHG iii 29 ), but he is possibly mythical; Phaselis is described as Dorian by Hdt. 2 . 178 . 2 , but is not called a πόλις ' Ελληνίς by Ps.-Skylax. According to Strabo 14 . 5 . 8 , Lindians and Achaians founded Kilikian Soloi (no. 1021 ). Pind. Ol . 7 . 73 ff relates the foundation myth of the three Rhodian poleis (they were founded by descendants of Helios) and names the eponymous hero of Lindos (a votive to whom survives as I.Lindos 56 Ab ( c. 313 ))."

Our only source for this community are the Athenian tribute lists in which the Λινδίων Οιιαtildeται are listed twice: in 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . iii . 26 ), paying 3 , 300 dr., and in 452 / 1 ( IG i³ 262 . iii . 28 ), same amount restored. In the same two years Lindos (no. 997 ) itself paid 8 tal., 2 , 700 dr. The Λινδίων Οιιαtildeται must have been the inhabitants of Οῖαι , a town in the territory of Lindos ( RE xvii. 2 . 2085 ; suppl. v. 746 -47 ). The fact that it paid individually may suggest that it was a dependent polis inside the territory of Lindos (cf. Hansen ( 1997 ) 31 ), or-considering the sporadic nature of its payments-suggest civic disorder at Lindos (cf. Schuller ( 1995 ) 166 -67 ). Alternatively, the appearance of the Oiiatai may indicate an arrangement serving primarily the interests of Athens by weakening a powerful ally.

The toponym is the same as that of the island, ' Ρόδος , ηasper ( Hell. Oxy . 20 . 6 ; Aeschin. Epist . 5 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 99 ; Diod. 13 . 75 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is ' Ρόδιος (C5l coins, infra ; Dem. 15 . 3 ; Lycurg. 1 . 15 ; IG xii . 6 149 . 4 (C4l)). Rhodos is called a polis in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 99 ( νηtildeσος καιgrave πόλις ); Lycurg. 1 . 14 ( τηgraveν απαγγελίαν . . . προgraveς τηgraveν πόλιν τηgraveν τῶν ' Ροδίων καιgrave τῶν ε µ πόρων τοῖς επιδη µ ουtildeσιν εκεῖ ); Dem. 15 . 14 ( εῖχον τηgraveν πόλιν οιasper νυtildeν όντες εν αυτ αsubiota ηtilde ' Ρόδιοι ); and Kallisthenes ( FGrHist 124 ) fr. 5 . 31 ; cf.

Tact. 18 . 13 . According to Diod. 13 . 75 . 1 , the inhabitants of the three old major poleis in 408 / 7 relocated to the city of Rhodos ( µ ετΩsubiotaωκίσθησαν εις µ ίαν πόλιν τηgraveν νυtildeν καλου µ ένην ' Ρόδον ), a process which Strabo 14 . 2 . 10 describes as synoecism. As in numerous other cases, only part of the population was transferred to the new urban centre, and it is clear that the synoecising cities continued to exist (Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 188 ; cf. nos. 995 -97 ). It is as yet unresolved to what extent the building of the town of Rhodos was 'immediately followed by a significant demographic event'(Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 189 ); however,three things are worth noting.( 1 ) It is apparent from Thuc. 8 . 44 . 2 that in 411 no city of Rhodos was yet in existence. ( 2 ) The democratic revolution in 395 took place in Rhodos town (Diod. 14 . 79 . 6 : πόλις ), which by the time already had harbours capable of sheltering large fleets ( Hell. Oxy . 18 . 2 ; Diod. 14 . 79 . 6 ) and an agora ( Hell. Oxy .), and was the place where officials resided ( Hell. Oxy .) and assemblies were held ( Hell. Oxy .). ( 3 ) At the time of the floods in 316 the city had a whole range of public buildings (Diod. 19 . 45 . 6 -8 ), and during the siege in 305 by Demetrios Poliorketes, Rhodos was a populous city (Diod. 20 . 84 . 3 ). The territory of Rhodos corresponded to those of Ialysos, Kamiros and Lindos ( c. 1 , 400 km ² ), and included a peraia already by C4 (Ps.-Skylax 99 ; Gabrielsen ( 2000 a ) 149 ). The population of Rhodos consisted of the populations of the three synoecising poleis , which were constituted as phylai (subdivided into demes: Papachristodoulou ( 1999 b )) of the new polis ( ' Ιαλυσία : BCH 99 ( 1975 ) p. 97 col. B. 26 -27 (C3 ); Κα µ ιρίς : Tit. Cam . 21 . 6 (C2 ); Λινδία : BCH 99 ( 1975 ) p. 97 col. A. 8 -9 (C3 ); see Jones, POAG 243 -44 ). According to Diod. 20 . 84 . 3 , during the siege of 305 there were 6 , 000 able-bodied politai in the city of Rhodos. At its foundation, Rhodos presumably became an ally of Sparta (no. 345 ), as were the three synoecising cities (Thuc. 8 . 44 . 2 ; Berthold ( 1980 ) 35 -36 ); prior to 395 , however, the Rhodians revolted from Sparta (Diod. 14 . 79 . 6 ; Bruce ( 1961 ) 166 -68 ). Rhodos was a member of a symmachia attested exclusively by the so-called ΣΥΝ coinage (whose legend abbreviates synmachon , synmachikon or synmachia , vel sim .) dating to C5l-C4e; the other poleis striking ΣΥΝ coins were Byzantion (no. 674 ), Ephesos (no. 844 ), Iasos (no. 891 ), Knidos (no. 903 ), Kyzikos (no. 747 ), Lampsakos (no. 748 ) and Samos (no. 864 ) (Karwiese ( 1980 ); Debord ( 1999 ) 273 -77 ). Rhodos was a founding member of the Second Athenian Naval League ( IG ii² 43 . 80 ( 378 / 7 )), and was probably allied with Athens (no. 361 ) prior to its entry into the League (Berthold ( 1984 ) 28 ). However, in 357 / 6 , Rhodos joined Chios (no. 840 ), Kos (no. 497 ) and Byzantion (no. 674 ) in a revolt against Athens (the 'Social War' of 357 -355 , Diod. 16 . 7 . 3 ; cf. Dem. 15 . 3 and Staatsverträge 305 ); the war ended in 355 when the Athenians, fearing Persian support for the rebels, concluded peace with them (Diod. 16 . 22 . 2 ), and recognised the independence of the rebels (Berthold ( 1980 ) 43 ; Cargill ( 1981 ) 182 -83 ). In 340 , Rhodos sent out forces, presumably naval, to support Byzantion against Philip II of Makedon, a support described as συ µµ αχία by Diod. 16 . 77 . 2 (Berthold ( 1980 ) 45 -46 ). In 332 , Rhodos submitted to Alexander the Great (Arr. Anab . 2 . 20 . 2 ), but the Makedonian garrison installed probably on this occasion was expelled in 323 (Diod. 18 . 8 . 1 ). Oligarchic exiles are attested at Hell. Oxy . 18 . 3 , and in 391 / 0 , οιasper εκπεπτωκότες ' Ροδίων υasperποgrave τουtilde δή µ ου arrived in Sparta. A navy is attested in Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 22 (at least sixteen triremes) and Lycurg. 1 . 18 (cf. Diod. 16 . 77 . 2 (r 340 )); Arist. Pol . 1304 b 29 attests to the existence of trierarchoi (cf. Diod. 20 . 88 . 6 (r 305 )). Reception of an Athenian embassy is recorded by Plut. Mor . 850 A (rC4s). Sending of an embassy of submission to Alexander is recorded in Arr. Anab . 2 . 20 . 2 (r 332 ). Exchange of embassies with Argos (no. 347 )-and presumably other poleis of mainland Greece-at the time of the Lamian War is attested by an Argive decree ( SEG 19 317 ( 325 -300 ) with Stroud ( 1984 ) 215 -16 ). During the grain crisis of 330 -326 , Rhodos received 30 , 000 medimnoi from Kyrene (no. 1028 ) (Tod 196 . 11 ). A grant of proxeny by Athens to a citizen of Rhodos is attested by IG ii² 19 a ( 394 / 3 ), and one to three men by Arkesine (no. 472 ) by IG xii . 7 8 (C4l-C3e); a grant of proxeny by an unknown Ionian polis to citizens of Rhodos is found in Peek, Inschriften von den dorischen Inseln no. 1 ( c. 300 ), a text that refers also to an earlier grant. A grant of citizenship by Athens to a citizen of Rhodos is attested by IG ii² 19 b ( 394 / 3 ) and one by Chios in SEG 39 1151 ( 320 s); special honours, including the right to address the assembly, were voted by Argos to citizens of Rhodos c. 320 (Stroud ( 1984 ) 215 -16 ). Rhodos must initially have been an oligarchy (Papachristodoulou ( 1999 b ) 29 ) since the revolution in 395 brought a democracy to power ( Hell. Oxy . 18 . 3 ). However,in the years 391 / 0 -390 / 89 there was a new outbreak of stasis ; oligarchs and democrats had the opposing faction expelled, possibly twice; the oligarchs were supported by Lakedaimonian squadrons, and the democrats by ships from Athens (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 20 -25 , 30 ; Diod. 14 . 97 . 1 -4 , 99 . 4 -5 ; cf. Westlake ( 1983 ); Gehrke, Stasis 137 -39 , pace Berthold ( 1980 ) 39 -40 ). Aristotle's mention of severe civic disorder arising from dikai is commonly connected with this series of revolutions, and the stasis was perhaps triggered by the democrats' introduction of political pay ( Pol . 1302 b 23 -4 , 32 -33 and 1304 b 27 -31 ). In the end the democrats must have expelled the oligarchs: Rhodos was among the founding members of the Second Athenian Naval League, and shortly after the Social War the democracy was overthrown and an oligarchy established with the support of the Karian satrap Mausolos (Dem. 15 . 3 , 14 -15 , 19 , 27 -28 ; Theopomp. fr. 121 ); a Karian garrison was installed (Dem. 15 . 14 -15 ), a democratic appeal for assistance in 351 fell on deaf ears in Athens (cf. Dem. 15 ), and Rhodos remained oligarchic and under Karian domination until the time of Alexander the Great (Berthold ( 1980 ) 43 -44 ), to whom the Rhodians submitted in 332 (Arr. Anab . 2 . 20 . 2 ). Alexander presumably restored democracy (Berthold ( 1980 ) 47 ; Bosworth ( 1980 ) 243 ); he certainly installed a garrison, whose expulsion is attested for 323 by Diod. 18 . 8 . 1 . For the democratic institutions, see Gabrielsen ( 1997 ) 24 -31 . The eponymous official was the priest of Helios ( SEG 12 360 (C4 ) with Sherk ( 1990 ) 283 -85 and Gabrielsen ( 2000 b ) 202 n. 49 ); άρχοντες are mentioned in Hell. Oxy . 18 . 2 , and πρυτάνεις at Diod. 20 . 88 . 3 ; a council ( βωλά ) is referred to by SEG 19 317 . 31 ( 325 -300 ) (cf. Diod. 20 . 93 . 5 (r 304 ): ηasper βουλή ). Arist. Pol . 1304 b 27 -31 attests to the existence of misthophora during a democratic period, but whether for office-holding or assembly attendance vel sim . is left unexplained.A meeting of the ekklesia is attested in Hell. Oxy . 18 . 2 (cf. SEG 18 317 . 31 ( 325 -300 )). The earliest preserved public enactment is the extremely fragmentary decree SEG 15 496 (C4 ). Dem 56 . 47 refers to a dikasterion at Rhodos. Residence of free foreigners at Rhodos is implied by Lycurg. 1 . 55 ( απεδή µ ησεν εις ' Ρόδον ); according to Diod. 20 . 84 . 3 , 1 , 000 able-bodied foreigners ( κατοικουtildeντες πάροικοι καιgrave ξένοι ) participated in the defence of the city during the siege of 305 / 4 ; this number, however, includes only those who remained behind after disabled foreigners and foreigners unwilling to serve in the defensive forces had left the city. The acropolis is situated on the terraced hill of Ag. Stephanos (Monte Smith), which dominates the amphitheatre-like shape of the city (cf. Diod. 19 . 45 . 3 , 20 . 83 . 2 ). The acropolis was included within the circuit of the city wall (cf. infra ). On the acropolis are remains of several monumental structures, but in their present form these are all Heltic or later. The only buildings assumed to have had Classical predecessors are the temple of Athena Polias and Zeus Polieus and the temple of Apollo Pythios. However, very little is known about the acropolis,since no systematic excavations have been conducted there so far (see further Konstantinopoulos ( 1973 ); Livadiotti and Rocco ( 1996 ) 12 -26 ). Also of Heltic date is the reconstructed stadion east of the temple of Apollo; however, it has now been demonstrated that it had a C4 predecessor with opposite,i.e. east-west, orientation (Valavanis ( 1999 ) esp. 99 with fig. 4 ). Recent archaeological discoveries prove that the city wall built in 407 was both of a smaller circumference and of lesser width than its C3e successor. To date, only a section of some 20 m of the early wall is known; it is constructed of orthogonal blocks in isodomic technique, and its width ( 0 . 60 m) indicates that this can have been only the outer face of the wall of whose inner face and central and inner constructions (probably in wood) nothing remains (Filimonos in Hoepfner and Schwandner ( 1994 ) 53 ). This type of construction may perhaps explain Diodorus' description of a particular stretch of this wall as ασθενεgraveς καιgrave ταπεινόν ( 20 . 86 . 2 ). The area enclosed by the early wall ( c. 300 ha) was much smaller than the area enclosed by its C3e successor ( c. 430 ha; see Philimonos-Tsopotou ( 1998 ) fig. 10 ): a much stronger and enlarged circuit was constructed in C3e, which at certain points shows a width of 3 . 50 m and even 4 . 10 m (see further Philimonos-Tsopotou ( 1998 ), ( 1999 )). The site chosen for the new city of Rhodos was not entirely virgin ground, as various finds indicate (DreliosiHerakleidou ( 1999 )). The city was laid out on an orthogonal grid plan at its foundation, but the direct participation of Hippodamos himself is reported only by Strabo 14 . 2 . 9 (see Wycherley ( 1964 ); Burns ( 1976 )). On average,each street was 5 . 50 m wide,with the exception of two conspicuously broad main streets,one in the western,the other in the eastern part of the town, which were 16 m and 16 . 5 m wide respectively (Kondis ( 1958 ) 151 ; ArchDelt 35 ( 1980 ) Chron . 534 ). In general, see Konstantinopoulos ( 1970 ), ( 1988 ); and Philimonos ( 1996 ). Archaeologically, the Classical city is poorly known. However, some impression of the C4s city may be gained from Diodorus' description of the great flood of 316 ( 19 . 45 . 6 -8 ). The description refers to ( 1 ) private houses built in stone: such houses have been found but are mostly of the Heltic period (Philimonos ( 1996 ) 87 ); ( 2 ) drains ( οχετοί ): the course of the main drain is known for a stretch of 200 m (Kondis ( 1954 ) 11 ; Philimonos ( 1996 ) 85 fig. 12 ; see also Owens ( 1991 ) 59 -60 ); ( 3 ) the deigma , which may or may not be part of the agora mentioned at Hell. Oxy . 18 . 2 : the agora is assumed to have been situated in the centre of the townnear the great harbour and within the mediaeval town (Kondis ( 1958 ) 152 ); ( 4 ) a Dionysion: this sanctuary is believed to have been situated in the neighbourhood of the agora (Philimonos ( 1996 ) 82 ); ( 5 ) an Asklepieion: this sanctuary has been located by recent finds in the south-western outskirts of the mediaeval town (Papachristodoulou ( 1999 a ) with fig. 1 ); ( 6 ) a theatre: the theatre has not been located, but it seems a reasonable hypothesis that it was situated in the southernmost section of the acropolis (Philimonos ( 1996 ) 76 ). In addition, a C5l-C4sanctuary of Demeter Thesmophoros has been identified in the northern part of the city; it consists of eight orthogonal structures and a subterranean room (Zervoudaki ( 1988 ); Y annikouri ( 1999 ) with fig. 2 ). Finally, for what it is worth, it may be noted that Vitruv. De arch . 6 intr. 1 mentions a gymnasion in reference to the Classical period (cf. Delorme ( 1960 ) 82 ). As early as the 390 s, the city was equipped with several harbours (Diod. 14 . 79 . 7 (r 396 ): εις τουgraveς λι µ ένας ; cf. 20 . 82 . 3 ). Archaeologically, a total of five harbours-all outside the circuit-are known, one of which is described as οasper µ ικροgraveς λι µ ήν by Diod. 20 . 85 . 4 and is commonly identified with the modern Mandraki harbour. Here, remains of neosoikoi dating from before and after 227 have been found (Blackman et al . ( 1996 )). Immediately south of Mandraki are the great harbour, the Akantia harbour and, further south, the southern harbour. The fifth harbour was situated in the north-western part of the city; this harbour, however, was filled up when the city expanded in C3 . Archaeological remains associated with naval facilities have been discovered in the vicinity of these harbours, especially by the western harbour and the Mandraki harbour (Blackman ( 1999 ); Philimonos-Tsopotou ( 1998 ) fig. 10 ). In terms of architectural splendour and topographical extent, the C4 cemetery complexes stretching out south of the city are far more modest in scale than those of the Heltic period, the early graves being characterised by simplicity. The C4 graves are situated not only by the city wall but also at a considerable distance from it, perhaps an indication of awareness of the need for future expansion of the urban area. On the cemetery complexes, see Fraser ( 1977 ) 1 -11 ; Salta ( 1999 ); Patsiada ( 2001 ) esp. 34 and fig. 1 . The patron divinity was Helios, depicted on the obverse of Rhodian coins ( infra ), whose priest was eponymous ( supra ) and in whose honour pentaeteric festivals were celebrated (Morelli ( 1959 ) 94 -99 ); note, however, that the usual identification of his sanctuary (Kontorini ( 1989 ) 129 -84 ) is now disputed by the excavator herself (Michalaki-Kollia ( 1999 )), and the question of the location of Helios' sanctuary must be considered unresolved.A festival of Dionysos is attested by SEG 19 317 ( 325 -300 ); cf. Diod. 20 . 84 . 3 . See further Morelli ( 1959 ). The Rhodian calendar is known only from C3m onwards (Trümpy, Monat . 167 -85 ). C. 330 -300 , the Rhodians dedicated at Delphi a sculptural group depicting the chariot of Helios (Jacquemin and Laroche ( 1986 )). Mikinas of Rhodos won the Olympic stadion in 324 (Diod. 17 . 113 . 1 ; Olympionikai 469 ); a Rhodian was victorious in the Lykaian Games (Arkadia) in C4l ( IG v . 2 550 . vi . 27 ). Beginning shortly after the synoecism, Rhodos struck coins in silver, bronze and gold.Silver:Ashton ( 2001 ) divides the Classical period silver issues of Rhodos (struck initially on the Chian-Rhodian standard, later on a reduced standard termed 'Rhodian' by Ashton) into three chronologically distinct periods. ( 1 ) 408 -c. 385 : the issues in this period fall into two groups: (a) standard Rhodian issues, and (b) a special series of the so-called ΣΥΝ coins with which is associated a group of conventional Rhodian coins related to the ΣΥΝ coins by their weight. Re (a), this group includes tetradrachms, hemidrachms and obols. Types: obv . head of Helios facing; rev . rose (on tetradrachms between two bunches of grapes) in ## II. The Poleis ## A. Pamphylia"

Aspendos is called a polis in the urban sense (Ps.-Skylax 101 ), in the territorial sense with the political sense as a connotation (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 30 ), and in the political sense ( SEG 17 639 . 6 , 10 , 18 (a citizenship decree of C4l/C3e)). The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally on Heltic coins ( infra ) and in the citizenship decree SEG 17 639 . 3 -4 (C4l/C3e); externally it is found in an Argive decree in honour of Aspendos ( SEG 34 282 . 4 ( c. 330 -300 )) as well as in literary sources (Theopomp. fr. 103 . 13 ; Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 30 ). For the individual and external use, see the Argive decree ( SEG 34 282 . 18 ( 330 -300 )). Aspendos is placed in Pamphylia by Ps.-Skylax 101 and Steph. Byz. 134 . 10 . The territory is called Ασπενδία in Theopomp.fr. 9 and is termed χώρα by Diod. 14 . 99 . 4 (r 388 ) and Arr. Anab . 1 . 26 . 5 (r 333 ). Its extent was disputed by its neighbours (Arr. Anab . 1 . 27 . 4 ); the dispute may have been with Side (no. 1004 ) (Bean ( 1979 ) 47 n. 1 ), with whom relations were bad (Polyb. 5 . 73 . 4 ). According to Hellan. fr. 15 , Aspendos was founded by the hero Aspendos. Other versions of the foundation myth are found in later sources: e.g. that it was an Argive foundation (Strabo 14 . 4 . 2 ). However, Mopsos, the legendary founder of Pamphylian cities (cf. Hereward ( 1958 ) 58 with refs.), has been suggested as the oecist of Aspendos too (Robert ( 1960 ) 177 -78 , who connects the coin types of a horseman hurling a spear and of a boar ( infra ) with the tradition of Mopsos'sacrifice of a boar to Aphrodite Kastnietis in Aspendos; cf. Strabo 9 . 5 . 17 ; Callim. Dieg . viii . 41 -ix . 1 -11 , Pfeiffer). The tradition of an Argive foundation of Aspendos (and Soloi (no. 1011 )) is the background for the decree of c. 330 -300 (from Nemea) in which Argos (no. 347 ) bestowed citizenship on the Aspendians (who are described as συγγενέ [ σι καιgrave αποίκ ] οις ) and granted the privilege of access to the Argive assembly (Stroud ( 1984 ) 200 -1 , 206 ). Aspendian theoroi were sent to Nemea and to Argos to participate in offerings to Zeus and Hera; the Aspendians were possibly granted prohedria (the reading is uncertain: Stroud ( 1984 ) 203 -4 ). It has been suggested that Aspendos became a member of the Delian League in the 450 s (Meiggs ( 1972 ) 58 , 102 ); but the only evidence of League membership is the restoration [ Αacuteσπεν ] δος [ ε µ Πα µ φ ] υλίαι in the assessment decree of 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 155 -56 ). Aspendos was possibly under Kilikian control c. 401 (Xen. An . 1 . 2 . 12 , a passage which distinguishes between Kilikians and Aspendians). In 388 the Aspendians were forced to pay a contribution to the Athenian commander Thrasyboulos, but later killed him in revenge for the conduct of his soldiers (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 30 ). In 333 Aspendos sent πρέσβεις αυτοκράτορες to Alexander the Great (Arr. Anab . 1 . 26 . 2 ) and was a subordinate party to a treaty with him ( Staatsverträge 405 ). The earliest evidence for public enactments is a decree of C4l/C3e granting citizenship to mercenaries ( SEG 17 639 ). This decree attests a number of institutions indicative of polis status. Apart from those already mentioned are an eponymous δη µ ιουργός ( 1 ), an εκκλησία ( 2 ), and a ιasperεροgraveν τηtildeς Αρτέ µ ιδος ( 13 -14 ). A citizen of Aspendos was granted proxenia by Anaphe (no. 474 ) ( IG xii . 3 250 ; cf. SEG 41 1788 (C4l/C3e)). Aphrodite Kastnietis, named after the mountain on which Aspendos was founded, had a cult in the city (Brandt ( 1988 ) 241 with refs.; cf. supra ). The C4l-C3e citizenship decree ( supra ) mentions a sanctuary of Artemis ( SEG 17 639 . 13 -14 ; Brandt ( 1988 ) 241 ). C4 -C3 coins ( infra ) testify to a cult of Athena (Brandt ( 1988 ) 242 ), and a cult of Zeus and Hera has been surmised on the basis of a late dedication ( SEG 17 641 ; Robert ( 1960 ) 187 -88 ; Brandt ( 1988 ) 243 ). The kerykeion of Hermes on C5 -C1 coins may indicate a cult of this divinity as well (Brandt ( 1988 ) 247 ). Aspendos was situated in the plain below the foothills of the Tauros mountains; it was on the river Eurymedon and in Antiquity was accessible for trade by sea (Xen. Hell . 4 . 8 . 30 ; Ps.-Skylax 101 ). In 333 it had a walled acropolis ( άκρα ) and a defence circuit enclosing the lower city (Arr. Anab . 1 . 26 . 5 -27 . 3 ). There are no urban remains from the Greek history of the city. Aspendos struck silver coins on the Persian standard from C5e. ( 1 ) Staters. Types: obv . naked warrior helmeted and armed with sword and shield fighting to r.; rev . triskeles, in field abbreviations of ethnic ( Estwediiys ) Ε , ΕΣ , ΕΣΤ , ΕΣΠ or ΕΣΤΓaltΕ (cf.

Pamphylia 153 -235 , 247 -61 , 436 , erroneously attributed to Sillyon, SNG Cop. Suppl . 516 -17 ; SNG von Aulock 4477 -503 ). Though it was allegedly an Argive foundation (Strabo 14 . 4 . 2 ), dialect inscriptions ( SGDI 1259 -64 ; SEG 38 1364 -94 , 41 1304 -21 ) indicate a substantial indigenous Pamphylian population."

The toponym is /acuteΙδυρος (Hecat. fr. 260 ; Ps.Skylax 100 ) or ' Ιδυρίς (Steph. Byz. 327 . 2 ) or ' Ιτυacuteρα ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 147 ( 425 / 4 ): the identification with Idyros is suggested by ATL i. 493 ). There is no cogent reason to accept Meineke's conjectures ' Ιδυρευacuteς and ' Ιδυρίς for MSS Γαυρευacuteς and Γαυρίς at Arist. De ventis 973 a 6 -7 . The only source to record a city-ethnic is Steph. Byz., who suggests ' Ιδυρίτης ( 327 . 2 ). Idyros is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 100 (cf. Steph. Byz. 327 . 2 , who may quote Hekataios for the siteclassification and not just for the toponym (Hecat. fr. 260 )). If the identification of Ityra with Idyros is accepted, the presumption is that it was a member of the Delian League and a polis in the political sense too: at least, it was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 147 ( 4 , 000 dr.)).It belonged to the Ionian district, which by then included the members of the former Karian district. Idyros is placed in Pamphylia by Steph.Byz. 327 . 1 , possibly citing Hekataios (fr. 260 ); Ps.-Skylax 100 places it in Lykia. Idyros' location is uncertain (Ruge ( 1916 ); cf. TAVO BV 15 , 15 . 2 and Barr . 65 ). It is normally identified with the ruins found at modern Kemer on the Lykian Pamphylian border (Özoral ( 1980 )). The 1980 investigation identified no Classical or Heltic remains. Hecat. fr. 260 , as cited by Steph. Byz. 327 . 1 , associates Idyros with a homonymous river, also mentioned by Theophr. fr. 5 . 53 (cf. ATL i. 493 -94 )."

Type: A: β . The toponym is Πέργη , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 100 , MSS πελπίπολις , conj. Salmassius; Arr. Anab . 1 . 26 . 1 (r 333 ); Strabo 14 . 4 . 2 ; IG i³ 71 . ii . 113 ( 425 / 4 )). The city-ethnic is Περγαῖος (Arr. Anab . 1 . 25 . 9 (r 333 )); possibly Graeco-Pamphylian Πρείιος on inscriptions (Merkelbach and S  ahin ( 1988 ) no. 1 (C5l/C4e)). Perge is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 100 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Arr. Anab . 1 . 25 . 9 (r 333 ) (Pergaian guides used by Alexander). Perge may have been one of the cities allegedly founded by a mixed contingent of people, led by Amphilochos, Mopsos and Kalchas, in the aftermath of the fall of Troy, but the city is not specifically mentioned in the sources (cf. Hdt. 7 . 91 ; Strabo 14 . 4 . 3 ). Statues of mythological founders, including Mopsos and Kalchas, stood at the main gates of Roman Perge, as revealed by inscriptions on bases (Merkelbach and S  ahin ( 1988 ) nos. 24 , 27 , imp.; S  ahin ( 1999 ) 140 -45 ; for Mopsos, see Hanfmann ( 1958 )). Olshausen ( 1972 ) suggests that Perge was in fact founded in the Mycenaean period from the Argolid and Sparta. A GraecoPamphylian dialect was spoken in Perge ( SGDI 1265 ; Ramsay ( 1880 ) 246 ; Blumenthal ( 1963 ) 46 ; Brixhe ( 1976 )). Perge was probably an indigenous community gradually Heled from C7 onwards (Martin ( 2000 ) 562 ). Perge was probably a member of the Delian League; at least, it was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . ii . 113 ). In 333 Alexander sent part of his force inland to Perge, whereas he himself took the route along the coast (Arr. Anab . 1 . 26 . 1 ). Perge is placed in Lykia by Ps.-Skylax (see supra , introduction),and in Pamphylia by Strabo.The territory of Perge may have extended westwards to Telmessos and eastwards to the river Kastros, according to the distribution of inscriptions honouring Artemis Pergaia and coin finds (Jameson ( 1974 ) 376 ). The city of Perge lay on a 50 m-high, flat plateau bordering upon the plain of Pamphylia, at modern Murtana; the city could be reached by the river Kestros (Strabo 14 . 4 . 2 ). The size of the Roman settlement area was c. 61 ha (Jameson ( 1974 ) 375 ), but the original Greek settlement probably comprised only the northern part of the site, the so-called Acropolis Hill. The earliest extant urban remains are the C3 city walls and the Heltic Doric temple outside the southern gate (Bean ( 1979 ) 25 -38 ; MacKay ( 1990 ) 2078 ). A temple and a cult of Artemis Pergaia ( Wanassa Preiia ) is known from Ps.-Skylax 100 and Strabo 14 . 4 . 2 (cf. Brandt ( 1992 )). According to Strabo, the location of the sanctuary was extra-urban ( 14 . 4 . 2 ) (such a location is probably also to be inferred from Ps.-Skylax 100 ; cf. Jameson ( 1974 ) 381 for further refs.). Remains of the Classical sanctuary have not been identified, but remains of a C3 -C2 Doric temple and fragments from a large Ionic temple outside the south gate of the city have revealed a major sanctuary (MacKay ( 1990 ) 2066 -67 ), possibly that of Artemis Pergaia. The cult with its annual festival (Strabo 14 . 4 . 2 ) is at least as old as the C5e-C4e dedication of Μαναψαι Πρειιαι (Merkelbach and S  ahin ( 1988 ) no. 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 100 ; Strabo 14 . 4 . 2 ; Brandt ( 1992 ); Lebrun ( 1992 ); MacKay ( 1990 ) 2048 ; cf. also the C4 inscription from Naukratis ( SGDI 5772 ); full survey: MacKay ( 1990 ) 2048 -58 ). The goddess was honoured by Pamphylians in general."

The city-ethnic is Σιδήτης (Arr. Anab . 1 . 26 . 4 ) or Σιδάτας (Nollé ( 1993 ) 225 , TEp 22 ). It is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 101 (who adds καιgrave λι µ ήν ). The collective use of the city-ethnic may be attested internally in abbreviated form on a unique coin of C5m ( infra ). It is attested externally in an Attic list of mercenaries ( IG ii² 1956 . 132 ( c. 300 )) and in literary sources (Arr. Anab . 1 . 26 . 4 -5 ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in C4sepulchral monuments from Rhodos ( I.Side 225 , TEp 22 ) and Attica ( IG ii² 12600 a), and internally on a marble base inscribed with the artist's name ( I.Side 1 (C3e)). Ps.-Skylax 101 and Steph. Byz. 565 . 10 place Side in Pamphylia. However, according to a story concerning the musician Stratonikos (Ath. 350 A), Side was not situated in Pamphylia, but, presumably, in Kilikia. Side was probably the most important harbour in Pamphylia (if that is where it was), at least in Heltic times, with a large territory bordering on the territories of Aspendos (no. 1001 ), Etenna (Nollé ( 1984 )), and Karallia (Nollé ( 1993 ) 12 -15 ). Bean (( 1979 ) 47 n. 1 ) suggests a border dispute with Aspendos, with whom relations were bad (Polyb. 5 . 73 . 4 (r 218 )). Side was supposedly colonised from Kyme (no. 817 ) (Ps.Skylax 101 ; Arr. Anab . 1 . 26 . 4 ; Strabo 14 . 4 . 2 ), possibly in C7l (Martin ( 2001 ) 517 ). The foundation myth was that Side was named after Side, the daughter of Tauros and wife of Kimolos; it is reported by Steph. Byz. 565 . 10 -12 , perhaps quoting Hekataios (cf.Hecat.fr. 262 ). The tradition-found in Strabo, Ps.-Skylax and Arrian-that Side was a foundation of Aiolian Kyme probably has its origin in the age of Alexander the Great, but there may be a kernel of truth, reflecting early Kymaian colonisation in Pamphylia. An influx of C8 -C7 Greek, possibly Aiolian, settlers at Side is conceivable, given the background of the traditions and the archaeological evidence of Greek influence in other Pamphylian and Kilikian cities; cf. Aspendos (no. 1001 ) and Soloi (no. 1011 ). However, the degree of Helation cannot be determined by archaeology, and no Archaic Greek finds are mentioned by Mansel (( 1965 ) 881 ) or by Nollé (( 1993 ) 37 ; cf. also 45 -47 for the linguistic evidence). During the reign of Kroisos, Side lay within the Lydian sphere of influence (Hdt. 1 . 28 ), but after the fall of Lydia the region came under the rule of Persian satraps, and the city is absent from the Athenian tribute lists (historical survey: Nollé ( 1993 ) 47 ff). According to tradition, the Sidetans gave up speaking their native Hellenic tongue ( ' Ελλάς γλῶσσα , Arr. Anab . 1 . 26 . 4 ) and adopted a barbarian language ( εβαρβάριζον , Arr. Anab . 1 . 26 . 4 ) which was spoken until the late Heltic period (C3 or C2 ). It has a non-Greek name (Mansel in Mansel and Neumann ( 1975 ) 171 ). On the Sidetan language and Greek-Sidetan bilinguals, see Neumann ( 1968 ); Brixhe ( 1969 a ); Nollé ( 1988 ). The Greek history of Side commenced-or recommenced-in the early Heltic period with the occupation of the city by Alexander the Great,and with the growing Helation reflected, for instance, in the Greek-sounding names of officials recorded on C4 coins ( infra ). The city had a sanctuary of Athena (Strabo 14 . 4 . 2 ), and the head of this goddess is the most common coin type ( infra ), which testifies to the importance of her cult at Side (cf. Nollé ( 1993 ) 107 -8 ). A late source (ibid. 262 . 4 ) gives Apollo as ktistes , and Apollo was depicted already on C5 coins ( infra ). The cults of Athena and Apollo undoubtedly took over from indigenous divinities (Mansel ( 1965 ) 880 ; Nollé ( 1993 ) 107 ), though Bing ( 1969 ) 111 suggests a connection with Athena Lindia. The city is situated on a low coastal promontory c. 9 km west of the estuary of the river Melas.There was direct access to a sandy bay which served as the only-not very convenient-harbour of the city (Mansel ( 1965 ) 899 ). The city encompassed the whole promontory, c. 45 ha, in Heltic and Roman times, but probably comprised only the outermost peninsula in the Archaic and Classical periods. However, pre-Heltic urban remains are sparse; the impressive fortifications go back no earlier than C2m (Mansel ( 1965 ) 881 , 897 -99 ). Side struck silver coins on the Persic standard from c. 450 / 430 to 330 ; for the mint within Persian suzerainty, see Nollé ( 1993 ) 49 -50 . The initial date of minting has been disputed, but is now placed after 450 (Kraay ( 1976 ) 275 ; Nollé ( 1993 ) 37 , 49 ; for the coinage of Side: Atlan ( 1967 ); Kraay ( 1969 ); Brixhe ( 1969 b )). ( 1 ) A unique stater of C5m has obv . pomegranate; legend: ΣΙ∆Η (retr.); rev . raven. Uncertain legend in Sidetan-Pamphylian alphabet (DestrooperGeorgiades ( 1995 )). ( 2 ) Staters, C5s: obv . pomegranate resting on dolphin; rev . head of Athena in Corinthian helmet, in incuse square.Lower denominations are tetrobols and obols, types as above. ( 3 ) Rare early issues have two dolphins and a sprig of olive or a head of Apollo as rev . types. ( 4 ) Staters with obv . pomegranate and rev . head of Athena continue in later issues. Lower denominations are tetrobols and obols, types as above: obv . lion's head, or Gorgoneion; rev . head of Athena in Corinthian helmet, in incuse square. ( 5 ) C. C4e-300 new types were introduced: staters: obv . standing Athena resting on shield or spear, holding owl or Nike, in field a pomegranate; rev . Apollo wearing only chlamys standing before an altar holding patera and laurel branch, in field legends naming officials in the Sidetan alphabet. For the stereotypically statue-based renderings of the divinities, see Nollé ( 1993 ) 51 , 112 . ( SNG Cop. Pamphylia 369 -78 ; Suppl . 520 ). ## B. Kilikia"
1005,Aphrodisias,"The South Coast of Asia Minor (Pamphylia, Kilikia)",36.1,33.4,450,2411,"1005 . Aphrodisias Map 66 . Lat. 36 . 10 , long. 33 . 40 . Size of territory: ? Type: C: γ . The toponym is Αφροδίσιος (Ps.Skylax 102 ) or Αφροδισιάς , -άδος , ηasper (Alex. Polyh. ( FGrHist 273 ) fr. 29 ( = Steph. Byz. 150 . 11 ), citing Zopyros; Diod. 19 . 64 . 5 (r 315 )). Ps.-Skylax describes it as a λι µ ήν ; Diodorus, Ps.-Skylax and Alexander Polyhistor place it in Kilikia. Alexander Polyhistor relates a foundation myth. The territory of Aphrodisias must have comprised the coastal lowland of the river Melas, later, with the foundation of Seleukeia, probably annexed by this city. Aphrodisias is situated on the eastern side of the isthmus joining the promontory of Zephyrion with its hinterland, c. 31 km south-west of Seleukeia. The city had harbours on the western and eastern sides of the peninsula (Ps.-Skylax 102 ; cf. Hellenkemper and Hild ( 1986 ) 28 n. 12 for the suggestion that the eastern harbour is the limen heteros of Holmoi (no. 1006 )). The early remains are on two hills to the south-west of the isthmus (Bean and Mitford ( 1970 ) 193 -94 fig. 8 ). These, separated by a gully, were fortified by C5 -C4 walls raised in cyclopean and in polygonal masonry,strengthened with square towers and a curtain-wall. The settlement area on the small plateau above the eastern harbour comprised c. 15 ha, but no extant remains are Greek ( TIB 5 : 194 ). A cult of Aphrodite is suggested partly by the name of the city (cf. the foundation myth (Steph. Byz. 150 . 13 )) and partly by the evidence of the coin types ( infra ). Aphrodisias struck silver coins on the Aiginetan standard from c. 520 (Imhoof-Blumer ( 1901 -2 ) 433 -36 ). Obv . female(?) figure in Knielauf holding uncertain object; rev . baetyl in incuse square (Head, HN ² 717 ). From c. 485 : obv . winged female figure in Knielauf holding kerykeion or staff or wreath; rev . baetyl in incuse square; legend: letters of uncertain meaning (Head, HN ² 717 ). From c. 379 -374 , the time of Pharnabazos(?), coins were perhaps struck at this mint on the Persic standard. Staters: obv . Aphrodite seated between sphinxes; rev . Athena Parthenos (cf. Kraay ( 1976 ) 280 , 283 ; Head, HN ² 718 ). Obols: obv . Gorgoneion; rev . seated sphinx ( SNG Cop. Cilicia 68 ). Other obv . types, all obols, carry beardless head, or head of Hermes, or facing female head; and rev . head of Aphrodite, or Aphrodite seated between sphinxes, or sphinx."

The toponym is /asperacuteΟλ µ οι (Ps.Skylax 102 ; Strabo 14 . 5 . 4 ). The city-ethnic ' Ολ µ ίτης is attested on C4 coins ( infra ). Ps.-Skylax 102 describes it as a polis Hel , polis being used in the urban sense. The population of Holmoi was transferred to Seleukeia on the Kalykadnos when that city was founded in 312 (Strabo. 14 . 5 . 4 ). However, Holmoi may have continued to serve as the harbour of Seleukeia,and the toponym survived into the Byzantine period ( TIB 5 : 272 ). Coin types may indicate cults of Athena and of Apollo ( infra ). Holmoi is placed in Kilikia (Ps.-Skylax 102 ; Strabo 14 . 5 . 4 ) and is identified with the modern site of Ta  sucu,on the coast c. 8 km south-west of Seleukeia. The city probably occupied the upper part of the coastal plateau (Blumenthal ( 1963 ) 114 fig. 38 , 120 ). There are no urban remains from the Greek history of the city ( TIB 5 : 272 ). Holmoi struck silver coins on the Persian standard from C4 (Imhoof-Blumer ( 1901 -2 ) 453 -54 ; BMC Lycaonia 109 -10 ). Staters: obv . standing Athena holding Nike; rev . Apollo Sarpedonios; legend: ΟΛΜΙΤΙΚΟΝ . Smaller denominations (including some in bronze) have obv . head of Athena; rev . head of Apollo, or of a goddess; legend: ΟΛΜΙΤΙΚΟΝ or ΟΛΜΙΤΟΝ or abbreviations (Head, HN ² 721 )."

The toponym is ' Ισσός , ηasper (Diod. 17 . 32 . 4 ; Arr. Anab . 2 . 7 . 1 (r 333 )) or ' Ισσός , οasper (Strabo 14 . 5 . 8 ; Ael. HA 6 . 48 ) or ' Ισσοί (Xen. An . 1 . 2 . 24 , 1 . 4 . 1 ). It was renamed Νικόπολις by Alexander the Great (Steph. Byz. 340 . 2 ; however, Strabo 14 . 5 . 19 distinguishes the two). The city-ethnic is ' Ισσευacuteς on some coins of c. 400 ( infra ); Steph. Byz. 340 . 3 suggests ' Ισσαῖος . Issos is called a polis , in the urban sense, by Xen. An . 1 . 4 . 1 and Diod. 14 . 21 . 1 (r 401 ). Xenophon describes it as µ εγάλην καιgrave ευδαί µ ονα and places it in Kilikia ( An . 1 . 4 . 1 ), as does Diod. 14 . 21 . 1 . Issos was situated on a c. 6 , 000 m ² -wide coastal plateau near the estuary of the river Pinaros, on the western border of Kilikia Pedia (cf. Diod. 14 . 21 . 1 ; Strabo 14 . 5 . 1 ; for the identification of the site with Ye  sil (Kinet) Hüyük, see Hellenkemper ( 1984 )). TIB 5 : 278 refers to Heltic pottery, but no Greek urban remains have been recorded. A silver coinage struck by local officials on the Persian standard from c. 400 has been attributed to Issos (the most recent survey is Brindley ( 1993 )). ( 1 ) Staters: obv . bearded Baal holding sceptre releases bird; rev . Ahuramazda with human upper body and winged lower body. On some the obv . legend is ΙΣΣΕΩΝ (information from Peter Franke) or ΙΣΣΙΚΟΝ and Teribazu in Aramaic (Head HN ² 722 ; SNG von Aulock 5601 ; Brindley ( 1993 ) 4 -5 ). ( 2 ) Coins struck in the period of the Satrap's Revolt c. 380 -370 are very similar to contemporary issues of Side (no. 1004 ), Nagidos (no. 1010 ) and Holmoi (no. 1006 ). Staters: obv . naked Apollo standing l. holding patera; legend: ΑΠΑΤΡΙΟΥ and ΙΣΣΙ , or variants; rev . naked Herakles standing r. holding club, bow and arrow, and lion skin ( SNG Cop. Cilicia 153 -55 ; Brindley ( 1993 ) 7 -8 ). ( 3 ) Another issue from the same period has obv . head of Athena, in style of Athena Parthenos; legend: ΙΣΙ (Brindley ( 1993 ) 8 ). The coinage is the only evidence for Helation in the Classical period; there is no tradition of Greek colonisation, and Issos may well have been a barbarian rather than a Hellenic polis ."

The toponym is Κελένδερις , -έως ( IG i³ 71 . 146 ; Strabo 14 . 5 . 3 ; Stadiasmus 192 ). The MSS of Ps.Skylax 102 have Κελενδρίς , emended in GGM . Kelenderis is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 102 . That it was a polis in the political sense too is indicated by its membership of the Delian League.At least, it was assessed for tribute in 425 / 4 ( IG i³ 71 . 146 ), 2 tal. Kelenderis was a Greek colony founded by Samos (no. 864 ) (Pompon. 1 . 77 (with Nagidos); Hdn. iii . 2 925 . 7 ). The Samian foundation is tentatively dated before 700 (Shipley ( 1987 ) 41 -42 ). A cult of Hera was taken over from the metropolis Samos (Hdn. Περιgrave µ ον . λέξ . 925 . 7 , Lentz). C8l Greek sherds from Tarsos attest Greek presence in Kilikia from this period (Braun ( 1982 ) 15 ). Ps.-Skylax 102 places Kelenderis in Kilikia. It lay on a coastal promontory, protecting the natural harbour below; a larger harbour was situated 1 . 6 km to the west.Strabo 14 . 5 . 3 describes it as having a λι µ ήν . Urban remains from the Greek history of the site are sparse; some stretches of the circuit wall are probably Greek, though no chronology is offered ( TIB 5 : 298 ). Kelenderis struck silver coins on the Persic standard from C5m.( 1 ) Staters: obv . nude horseman with whip riding to l.; rev . goat kneeling l. head reverted, at times symbols in field, all within incuse circle; legends on either obv . or rev .

Type: A: β . The toponym is Μαλλός , ηasper (Arist. De ventis 973 a 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 102 ; Arr. Anab . 2 . 5 . 9 ; Eust. Comm . Dionys . Per . 875 ) or Μάλος (Diod. 19 . 56 . 5 ). The cityethnic is Μαρλότας on C5l/C4e coins ( infra ) or Μαλλώτης (Arr. Anab . 2 . 5 . 9 ). Mallos is called a polis in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 102 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally on coinage ( infra ), and externally in Arr. Anab . 2 . 5 . 9 (r 333 ). The Mallotai were supposedly άποικοι of Argos (no. 347 ) (Arr. Anab . 2 . 5 . 9 ; cf. Bing ( 1969 ) 110 ). A foundation myth involved the Argive hero Amphilochos and Mopsos (Strabo 14 . 5 . 16 ; cf. supra 1216 ). There was a cult of Amphilochos in Mallos (Arr. Anab . 2 . 5 . 9 (r 333 )), and his famous oracle in Mallos is attested in late sources (Bosworth ( 1980 ) 197 ). The Aramaic coin legends, however, should be noted, and it has been suggested that the name indicates a Phoenician origin (Triedler ( 1969 )). Alexander the Great conquered Mallos in 333 and put an end to an ongoing stasis between the citizens (Arr. Anab . 2 . 5 . 9 ). Mallos is placed in Kilikia by Ps.-Skylax 102 and Diod. 19 . 56 . 5 . It has been identified with the urban remains on a hill above the river Ceyhan (ancient Pyramos), near the present-day village of Kiziltahta.According to local inhabitants, an inscription mentioning the city was found in the vicinity ( AnatSt ( 1974 ) 28 ). Mallos' harbour was Magarsos (see supra 1213 ), and the two cities became Antiocheia on the Pyramos during the reign of Antiochos IV.The extant urban remains are Roman ( TIB 5 : 337 ). Mallos struck coins from C5s on the Persian standard. ( 1 ) Staters: obv . semi-nude male winged figure in Knielauf to r., holding disk with star on it, at times Aramaic legend; rev . swan, in field various symbols; legend: ΜΑΡΛΟΤΑΝ , ΜΑΡΛΟ , ΜΑΛΡΟ or other abbreviations. Other types are obv . bearded winged figure in Knielauf holding disk, various symbols in field; rev . as above.An issue attested by a single specimen has obv .

The city-ethnic is Ναγιδευacuteς ( SEG 39 1426 . 4 (after 238 ); C4e coins ( infra )). It is called a polis in the urban sense by Hecat. fr. 266 (Hansen ( 1997 ) 24 ) and Ps.-Skylax 102 . It is placed between Pamphylia and Kilikia by Steph. Byz. 466 . 24 , possibly citing Hecat. fr. 266 , and in Kilikia by Ps.-Skylax 102 . The metropolis was supposedly Samos (no. 864 ) (Pompon. 1 . 77 ; cf. Shipley ( 1987 ) 41 -42 ), and Hecat. fr. 266 identifies an eponymous founder, Nagis. On the basis of Strabo, who mentions Nagidos as the first city after Anemourion ( 14 . 5 . 3 , cf. 14 . 6 . 3 ), the city has been identified with the ruins of Bozyazı, c. 18 km east of Anemourion. Nagidos was situated on a coastal plateau, fortified with a circuit wall, of which substantial segments are extant. The C5 -C4fortification was built in polygonal and isodomic masonry, strengthened with square bastions. The few other urban remains are Roman, but surface finds cover C4 through Roman periods.The cemetery of the Greek city on the slopes of the settlement plateau has been investigated ( TIB 5 : 363 -64 ; Bean and Mitford ( 1970 ) 191 -92 ). Nagidos struck silver coins from C5l on the Persian standard. Staters: obv . Aphrodite seated l. on throne holding phiale,crowned by Eros; rev . bearded Dionysos,in himation , standing l. holding thyrsos and grapes; legend: ΝΑΓΙ∆ΙΚΟΝ or ΝΑΓΙ∆ , all in incuse circle. Variant types have rev . Dionysos in chlamys holding kantharos; legend: ΝΑΓΙ∆ΕΩΝ . Or obv . head of bearded Dionysos with ivy wreath; rev . head of Athena, legends as above. Smaller denominations are tetrobols: types as above, and obols: obv . head of Aphrodite; rev . head of Dionysos, or standing Dionysos, or head of Pan, or kantharos. The mint produced coins until c. 333 , with variations of the above types. Nagidos also issued a bronze coinage in the same period ( SNG Cop.

Soloi is called a polis Hel in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 102 . The earliest attestation of the political sense is Polyb. 21 . 24 . 10 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is found internally on Classical coins ( infra ), and externally in Lind. Temp. Chron . ( FGrHist 532 ) C. 33 (rC6 or rC5 )) and at Polyb. 21 . 24 . 11 . Hes. fr. 279 , MW, associates Soloi with the death of Amphilochos; Euphorion fr. 1 (Scheidweiler) and Diog. Laert. 1 . 51 report that the name originally derived from Solon and believe it to be an Athenian colony. Soloi was allegedly founded by Lindos (no. 997 ) on Rhodos and by Achaians (Strabo 14 . 5 . 8 , 17 ). Bing ( 1971 ) suggests a foundation date of 700 -600 ; Boardman (( 1980 ) 50 ) suggests C7e (but notes that there is no archaeological evidence). For a pre-C7 colonisation by Argos (no. 347 ), see Pompon. 1 . 13 ; Polyb. 21 . 24 . 11 ; Livy 37 . 56 . 7 (with Blumenthal ( 1963 ) 106 ). Ps.-Skylax 102 describes Soloi as a polis Hel , and inscriptions in Doric Greek are known from the site (Erzen ( 1940 ) 71 n. 118 ), though the term σολοικίζειν , 'speaking incorrectly' , is supposed to derive from Kilikian Soloi (Strabo 14 . 2 . 28 ; cf. Diog. Laert. 1 . 51 ). It has been suggested that originally it was a Phoenician colony settled by Rhodians in C8 (Olshausen ( 1975 )). The Argive foundation of Soloi and kinship between Argos (no. 347 ) and Soloi are reflected in the Argive decree ( SEG 34 282 ) which grants citizenship to the Aspendians and access to the Argive aliaia (cf. Aspendos (no. 1001 )) and refers to similar rights as granted previously,i.e.before c. 330 , to Soloi (Stroud ( 1984 ) 201 -2 , 208 ). In 333 Alexander the Great fined the city for its support for Persia (Arr. Anab . 2 . 5 . 5 ) and gave it a democratic constitution ( Anab . 2 . 5 . 8 ). A dedication was made to Athana Lindia, prior to C3 , possibly in C5 or even in C6 according to Blinkenberg (( FGrHist 532 ) C. 33 ). Soloi was situated on a coastal plateau on the estuary of the river Liparis.The urban remains of the c. 35 ha settlement site are no earlier than the late Heltic period ( TIB 5 : 382 ). An acropolis is mentioned by Curt. 3 . 7 . 2 . Soloi struck silver coins from c. 480 to 333 . ( 1 ) Sigloi of the royal Persian type, c. 480 : obv . Amazon examining bow l.; rev . rough rectangular incuse. ( 2 ) In c. 460 followed a first issue of staters on the Persic standard: obv . type as above; rev . bunch of grapes, no legend. ( 3 ) From c. 440 staters: obv . Amazon kneeling l. wearing pointed cap, holding bow, in field bow case and quiver; rev . bunch of grapes; legend: ΣΟ or ΣΟΛΕΩΝ , at times letters, possibly magistrates'initials, all within incuse square. Lower denominations are tetrobols (types as above), obols and hemiobols: obv . head of Amazon; rev . as above. ( 4 ) Later issues have obv . head of Athena in Athenian helmet; rev . bunch of grapes; legend: ΣΟΛΙ , or ΣΟΛΙΟ , or ΣΟΛΙΟΝ , or the ktetic ΣΟΛΙΚΟΝ . Lesser denominations are obols and hemiobols (types as above). ( 5 ) From 386 to 333 , staters: obv . head of Herakles; rev . bearded head of satrap in Persian tiara; legend: ΣΟΛΕΩΝ or ΣΟΛΙΚΟΝ . Also staters with types as above, but on rev . owl in field. ( 6 ) In C4 also an issue of bronze coins: obv . head of Athena; rev . bunch of grapes; legend: ΣΟΛΕΩΝ and magistrates' names (Head, HN ² 728 ; Brindley ( 1994 ) 264 -65 , groups 1 -7 ; SNG Cop.

1012,Amathous (Amathousios),Cyprus,34.15,33.1,731,3669,"1012 . Amathous (Amathousios) Map 72 . Lat. 34 . 15 , long. 33 . 10 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A: β . The toponym is Α µ αθουtildeς , -ντος , ηasper (Hdt. 5 . 105 . 1 ; Epiph. De xii Gemmis 1 . 6 ). The city-ethnic is Α µ αθουacuteσιος (Hdt. 5 . 104 . 2 ). Amathous possibly appears as a kingdom in the inscriptions of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal (Borger ( 1956 ) no. 60 . 71 ; Baurain ( 1981 ); Collombier ( 1991 ) 27 -28 ). It is called a polis in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 103 , where Amathous, with the comment αυτόχθονές εισιν , is listed as one of the toponyms after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε . Polis in the political sense is found in SEG 16 789 (C4l/C3e). The syllabic inscriptions of Amathous show indeed that a thus far undeciphered language ('Eteokyprian') was written (and spoken?) there (Masson ( 1983 ) 203 -6 ; but see Reyes ( 1994 ) 13 -17 ); a Phoenician element is also attested,especially in the Archaic period (Hermary ( 1997 )). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Hdt. 5 . 104 . 2 . Amathous sided with the Persians in the Ionian Revolt. The city must have been fortified by then, as it was besieged by Onesilos of Salamis and successfully defended (Hdt. 5 . 104 -8 , 114 ). In 391 it was allied with Soloi (no. 1021 ) and Kition against Euagoras I (Ephor. fr. 76 ; Diod. 14 . 98 . 2 ). King Androkles joined Alexander the Great during the siege of Tyros in 332 and lost his quinquireme (Arr. Anab . 2 . 22 . 2 ). ²⁵ Masson ( 1964 ) 210 -31 ; Nicolaou ( 1976 c ); Buchholz ( 1977 ). ²⁶ Collombier ( 1991 ) 38 . No evidence for Golgoi as an independent state in this period: Hill ( 1949 ) 133 n. 4 . ²⁷ Sector of living quarters and fortification wall of the Classical period: Bakalakis ( 1988 ). ²⁸ Collombier ( 1991 ) 30 . 'Rural sanctuary' at Golgoi, 1 st phase until C4l: Christou ( 1995 ) 822 -24 . For Ayia Irini, see SCE ii. 642 -824 ; Quilici and QuiliciGigli ( 1972 -73 ); Nicolaou ( 1976 a ). During the Archaic and Classical periods the acropolis and the lower town were defended by a city wall with rectangular towers (Hermary ( 1993 ) 174 -75 ; Aupert and Hermary ( 1995 ) 95 ; Aupert ( 2000 ) 47 -52 ); the defences enclosed c. 18 ha. The main architectural remains on the acropolis consist of a large public building (a palace?), rebuilt several times between C8m and c. 300 , and the open court sanctuary of Aphrodite,C8m to first century ad (Hermary ( 1993 ) 175 -76 , 183 -87 , ( 1997 ) 88 ; Aupert and Hermary ( 1995 ) 90 -93 ; Aupert ( 2000 ) 52 -55 , 59 -63 ). The 'goddess of Amathous' was Aphrodite, often called 'Kypria' or 'Aphrodite Kypria' ( Catal . 36 . 11 -14 , 68 . 51 ; Verg. Aen . 10 . 51 ; Ov. Met . 10 . 220 -42 ; Paus. 9 . 41 . 2 mentions an 'ancient sanctuary of Adonis and Aphrodite'). The eponymous hero Amathous, son of Aërias, the founder of the Paphian shrine of Aphrodite, is said to have founded the sanctuary of the Amathousian Venus,one of the three oldest shrines in Cyprus (Tac. Ann . 3 . 62 . 4 ). Another tradition makes the Amathousians descendants of 'companions of Kinyras, who had been put to flight by the Greeks who accompanied Agamemnon'(Theopomp.fr. 103 ). The kings of Amathous struck coins on the Persian standard, from C4e on the Rhodian standard, c. 460 / 430 -c. 350 (Rhoïkos). Denominations: stater and fractions down to hemiobol. Principal types: obv . recumbent lion, sometimes with eagle flying above, or lion's head; rev . forepart of lion in incuse square or circle; legend: name of king in syllabic script (Babelon, Traité ii. 2 nos. 1254 -77 ; Head, HN ² 737 ; Masson ( 1983 ) 209 -12 ; Amandry ( 1984 ); SNG Cop. Cyprus 1 -4 )."
1013,Idalion (Edalios),Cyprus,35.7,33.25,803,4280,"1013 . Idalion (Edalios) Map 72 . Lat. 35 . 7 , long. 33 . 25 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A: β . The toponym is ' Ιδάλιον (e-ta-lio-ne ( ' Εδάλιον ) in C5syllabic inscriptions such as ISC217 -18 ; Steph. Byz. 326 . 6 ). The city-ethnic is ' Εδάλιος (syllabic e-ta-li-e-we-se: ICS 217 . 2 ). Idalion appears as a kingdom, 'Edil' , in the lists of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal (Borger ( 1956 ) no. 60 . 63 ). The C5m syllabic inscription ICS 217 (Mitford and Masson ( 1982 ) 72 ) mentions the basileus Stasikypros and the πτόλις of Idalion. Both contribute to the emoluments of physicians, and this seems to imply that the ptolis had a separate treasury. Thus αasper πτόλις here seems to have a political meaning, although it does not follow from the extant text that the king and city shared the government of Idalion, as is sometimes assumed. In line 1 referring to a siege of the city, πτόλις is used in the urban sense; and Idalion is likely to be one of the unnamed poleis mentioned in the urban sense by Hdt. 5 . 115 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ) and in inscriptions ( ICS 217 , 220 , 228 ). Idalion joined the Ionian Revolt and was besieged and taken by the Persians (Hdt. 5 . 115 . 1 -2 ). The inscription ICS 217 records a siege of Idalion by 'Medes and Kitians'(its date is disputed, between c. 478 and c. 445 , if not later); but the siege was unsuccessful, as King Stasikypros still ruled when the inscription was set up. Thus these operations cannot have been connected with the conquest of Idalion by the Phoenicians during the reign of King Ozbaal of Kition, who seems to have ruled shortly after the middle of C5 (the precise chronology of these events and of the kings of Kition is still disputed: Collombier ( 1991 ) 34 -35 ; Maier ( 1994 ) 310 ). It is also open to debate whether Idalion was incorporated into the kingdom of Kition or ruled in personal union only. In any case, Phoenician influence followed political conquest: Phoenicians lived at Idalion, as their tomb inscriptions testify; Phoenician deities were worshipped in the city. The city seems to have suffered a major destruction at the end of C4 (Stager and Walker ( 1989 ) 466 ; Hadjicosti ( 1993 )), but survived into Heltic and Roman times. The principal (western) acropolis was fortified already in the Archaic period, and thus was possibly affected by the Persian siege of 498 / 7 . At the end of C6 the whole city, including both citadels (an area of c. 40 ha), was enclosed by a fortification wall with rectangular bastions (stone foundation with mudbrick superstructure), which was rebuilt at least twice and remained in use until c. 300 (Stager and Walker ( 1978 ), ( 1979 ), ( 1989 ) 13 -57 , 462 -64 ; Hadjicosti ( 1994 ), ( 1995 )). A large building on the western acropolis may have served in the Archaic period as a palace, and in the Classical period as the administrative centre of Idalion with archives (C4 ostraka,with mainly Phoenician,but also some syllabic and alphabetic Greek texts; Masson ( 1992 ); Hadjicosti ( 1994 ), ( 1995 ); Stager and Walker ( 1989 ) 5 -13 , 462 -64 ). It remains to be seen whether the 'alignments suggestive of an overall building plan' observed so far do constitute 'evidence for town-planning' in C5 (Stager and Walker ( 1989 ) 463 ). The main cult of Idalion was that of Aphrodite (Theoc. Id . 15 . 100 -3 ; Verg. Aen . 1 . 681 , 692 -93 , 10 . 51 -52 ; Catal . 36 . 11 -12 , 64 . 96 ). A court sanctuary of the 'Great Mother' , identified by the Greeks with Aphrodite, and a C8 -C4 open-air sanctuary of Apollo Amyklos, the Phoenician 'Reshef Mikal' , were situated on the eastern acropolis (Masson ( 1968 a ); Senff ( 1993 ); Gaber ( 1997 ) 137 ). The western acropolis housed a temenos of Athena (identified with 'Anat' by the Phoenicians), C8m(?)c. 475 . The kings of Idalion struck coins on the Persian standard C6lc. 450 (Stasikypros).Denominations:stater and fractions down to twelfth. Principal types: obv . sphinx seated, or head of Aphrodite; legend: name of king in syllabic script; e-ta-li on a series of Stasikypros; rev . incuse square, or lotus flower in incuse circle (Babelon, Traité ii. 2 nos. 1245 -53 ; Head, HN ² 738 -39 ; Masson ( 1983 ) 250 -52 ; SNG Cop.

1014,Karpasia (Karpaseus),Cyprus,35.4,34.25,335,1626,"1014 . Karpasia (Karpaseus) Map 72 . Lat. 35 . 40 , long. 34 . 25 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: [A]: α . The toponym is Καρπασία , ηasper (Hellan. fr. 57 ) or Καρπάσεια (Ps.-Skylax 103 ) or Κραπάσεια (Dion. Epic. fr. 2 , Heitsch). The cityethnic is Καρπασευacuteς ( Hell. Oxy . 15 . 3 ; Theopomp. fr. 20 ). Karpasia is called a polis in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 103 , where it is listed as one of the toponyms after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε ; it was, however, possibly never the capital of a kingdom (Hadjiioannou ( 1983 ) no. 197 ; Collombier ( 1993 ) 145 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Theopomp. fr. 20 ; in Hell. Oxy . 15 . 2 -4 an individual is repeatedly referred to as οasper Καρπασευacuteς (e.g. 23 . 2 , 3 , Chambers), but the individual use proper is not attested before C3 ( I.Cal . 227 .A. 17 ). In 398 a Καρπασευacuteς , elected strategos of Cypriot troops in Konon's force, led a mutiny at Kaunos ( Hell. Oxy . 15 . 1 -3 ). There is no further mention of the city until the siege by Demetrios in 307 / 6 (Diod. 20 . 47 . 2 ). Thus Karpasia must have been fortified at least in C4 ; but so far the only traces of the Archaic and Classical town are remains of a few C5 -C4 houses (du Plat Taylor ( 1980 ) 160 -82 ; see also Hogarth ( 1889 ) 88 -90 ) and a Classical cemetery (Dray and du Plat Taylor ( 1937 -39 )). According to a fragment of Hellanikos' Kypriaka , the town was founded by Pygmalion, king of Sidon (Hellan. fr. 57 apud Steph. Byz. 361 . 13 -14 ), but there is no evidence of Phoenician presence thus far (see also Gjerstad ( 1948 ) 441 -42 )."

The toponym is Κερυacuteνεια , ηasper (Ps.-Skylax 103 ; Diod. 19 . 62 . 6 ). The city-ethnic is Κερυνίτης (Diod. 19 . 59 . 1 (r 315 ); a restored [ Κερυ ] νήτης in Mitford ( 1980 ) no. 317 ( 225 / 4 ) is doubtful). Keryneia is called a polis in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 103 , where it is listed as one of the toponyms after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε . It was ruled by kings (Diod. 19 . 59 . 1 (r 315 ): basileus , 19 . 79 . 4 (r 313 / 12 ): dynastes ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Diod. 19 . 59 . 1 (r 315 ) and possibly at Kafizin (Mitford ( 1980 ) no. 307 ). Noremains of Archaic or Classical architecture have been discovered so far; Archaic-Heltic terracotta and lime- stone statuettes come from the sanctuary of an unknown deity. From Strabo's reference to an Achaion akte ( 14 . 6 . 3 ) on the north coast of Cyprus, it has sometimes been inferred, not very convincingly,that Keryneia was colonised from Achaia."
1016,Kourion (Kourieus),Cyprus,34.4,32.5,397,1795,"1016 . Kourion (Kourieus) Map 72 . Lat. 34 . 40 , long. 32 . 50 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: B: α . The toponym is Κουacuteριον (Hdt. 5 . 113 . 1 ). The city-ethnic is Κουριευacuteς (Hdt. 5 . 113 . 1 ; Arr. Anab . 22 . 22 . 2 (r 332 ); Aupert ( 1982 ) no. 265 . 5 ). Kourion appears as a kingdom, 'Kuri' , in the inscriptions of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal (Borger ( 1956 ) no. 60 . 68 ) and may have been one of the unnamed poleis mentioned in the urban sense at Hdt. 5 . 115 . The collective use of the cityethnic is attested externally in Hdt. 5 . 113 . 1 (cf. Aupert ( 1982 ) no. 265 . 5 (C2e)), its individual use externally in Arr. Anab . 22 . 22 . 2 (r 332 ). According to Hdt. 5 . 113 . 1 , the Kouriees were Αργείων άποικοι (cf. Strabo 14 . 6 . 3 : Argeion ktisma ). Kourion joined the Ionian Revolt (Hdt. 5 . 113 . 1 , by implication), but King Stasanor deserted the Cypriot army in the battle of Salamis in 498 (Hdt. 5 . 113 . 1 ). Thus we cannot be certain that Hdt. 5 . 115 . implies a siege and conquest of Kourion by the Persians in 498 / 7 ; no remains of city defences of this period have been discovered so far. In 332 King Pasikrates joined Alexander the Great at the siege of Tyros and lost his quinquireme (Arr. Anab . 22 . 22 . 2 ); in 323 / 2 he was appointed theorodokos to host theoroi from Nemea (Miller ( 1988 ) 148 . 6 -7 ). The protecting god of Kourion was Apollo Hylates ( I.Kourion 41 , 104 , etc.; Strabo 14 . 6 . 3 ). The remains of his sanctuary outside the walls date from C7 to the fourth century ad (Scranton ( 1967 ); Christou ( 1986 ) 50 -57 ; Soren ( 1997 ) 305 ). Nocoins can be securely attributed thus far to the kings of Kourion (Babelon, Traité ii. 2 nos. 827 -31 ; Head, HN ² 745 ; Cox ( 1959 ); Masson ( 1983 ) 200 -1 ; Collombier ( 1991 ) 30 )."

The toponym is Λήπηθις (Ps.-Skylax 103 ) or Λάπιθος (Diod. 19 . 62 . 6 (r 315 )) or Λάπηθος ( BCH 45 ( 1921 ) 4 . i . 5 ( 230 -220 )). The city-ethnic is Λαπίθιος (Diod. 19 . 59 . 1 (r 315 )) or Λαπήθιος (Traunecker et al . ( 1981 ) no. 38 ( c. 385 ); REG 3 ( 1890 ) 85 no. 74 ); cf. on the name RE xii. 763 . Lapethos occurs only once in a contemporary source: as a polis in the urban sense at Ps.-Skylax 103 , where it is listed as one of the toponyms after the heading πόλεις . . . αιasperacuteδε . The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Traunecker ( 1981 ) no. 38 ( c. 385 : ' Ονασίλος Λαπή ( θιος )) and Diod. 19 . 59 . 1 (r 315 ). Ps.-Skylax 103 calls the city Λήπηθις Φοινίκων . In the Archaic and Classical periods Lapethos seems indeed to have represented a kind of Graeco-Phoenician community-despite a Greek foundation legend (Lakonians under Praxandros: Strabo 14 . 6 . 3 ) and its undoubtedly Greek character in the subsequent Heltic period (Lapethos in a Delphic list of theorodokoi in Cyprus: Plassart ( 1921 ) 4 . i . 5 ( 230 -220 )). Greek and Phoenician names occur side by side in the list of kings; their coin legends uniformly use Phoenician script (except for the last king, Praxippos, who ruled when Lapethos was involved in the Successors' struggle for Cyprus (Diod. 19 . 59 . 1 , 62 . 6 (r 315 ); Maier ( 1994 ) 306 ); no syllabic inscriptions have been found thus far. The kings of Lapethos struck silver staters on the Persian standard C5fc. 312 (Praxippos). Principal types: obv . helmeted head of Athena; rev . helmeted head of Athena,or obv . head of Aphrodite; rev . helmeted head of Athena, or obv . head of Apollo; rev . Krater (Praxippos). Legends are: name of king in Phoenician script; Praxippos' in Greek letters (Babelon, Traité ii. 2 nos. 1356 -64 ; Head, HN ² 739 ; Schwabacher ( 1947 ) 79 -84 , 100 -1 nos. 206 -222 ; Robinson ( 1948 ) 45 -47 , 60 -65 ; Kraay ( 1976 ) 302 -3 ; SNG Cop.

The city-ethnic is Μαριευacuteς (syllabic ma-rie-u-se on coins of King Sasmas (C5e), Timocharis (C5l), Stasioikos II (C4l); cf. ICS 168 , 170 c, 171 e; Diod. 19 . 59 . 1 (r 315 )). Marion is called a ( polis ) Hel in the urban sense by Ps.-Skylax 103 (cf. Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 142 ). It is also likely to be one of the unnamed poleis mentioned in the urban sense by Hdt. 5 . 115 . The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Diod. 19 . 59 . 1 (r 315 ), internally on the coins of Sasmas (C5e), Timocharis (C5l), Stasioikos II (C4l); cf. ICS 168 , 170 c, 171 e. Marion joined the Ionian Revolt and was besieged and taken by the Persians (Hdt. 5 . 115 . 1 -2 ). Kimon laid siege to Marion in 449 (Diod. 12 . 3 . 3 ; Hill ( 1949 ) 123 ). The city was destroyed by order of Ptolemy I in 312 (Diod. 19 . 79 . 4 ). Whether and when the kings of Marion were lords of the palace of Vouni and dominated Soloi (no. 1021 ) from there is still open to debate (Hill ( 1949 ) 123 ; Nicolaou ( 1976 d ); Maier ( 1985 ) 36 -37 ; Collombier ( 1991 ) 31 -32 ; Reyes ( 1994 ) 92 -94 ; Nielsen ( 1994 ) 54 -61 ). Marion must have been a walled city, most likely already in 498 / 7 , and certainly in 449 , when it was besieged by the Athenians. The only remains of public architecture known so far consist of a sanctuary founded in C8 -C7 and abandoned or destroyed in C5 , and of (possible) traces of ramparts (Childs ( 1990 ), ( 1992 ), ( 1995 ), ( 1999 )). Rich cemeteries of the Archaic and Classical periods have also been excavated. The kings of Marion struck coins of silver and later also of gold and bronze on the Persian standard from C5e (Sasmas) to c. 312 (Stasioikos II, who used the Rhodian standard for some of his coins). Denominations (silver): stater and fractions down to twelfth. Principal types: obv . recumbent lion; rev . boar with Phrixos, or obv . head of Apollo; rev . female deity (Aphrodite?) on bull, or obv . head of Aphrodite; rev . thunderbolt,or ankh.Legends are basileus and name of king in syllabic script; sometimes Marieus is added in syllabic script, in Greek letters on coins of Stasioikos II (Babelon, Traité ii. 2 nos. 1328 -47 ; Head, HN ² 739 -40 ; Schwabacher ( 1947 ) 72 -78 , 92 -97 nos. 5 -154 ; Masson ( 1983 ) 181 -85 ; SNG Cop. Cyprus 24 ). Ps.-Skylax 103 classifies Marion as a ( polis ) ' Ελληνίς . T o judge from the archaeological evidence and from the epitaphs (Mitford ( 1960 ) 178 -98 ; Masson ( 1983 ) 154 -81 ), Marion was definitely a Greek city, despite King Sasmas ( c. 470 / 60 -450 ?), whose name is Phoenician and who uses the Phoenician MLK for 'king' on some of his coins (Gjerstad ( 1946 ); Mehl ( 1996 b ) 381 assumes a Phoenician ruling family using Greek names)."
1019,Paphos (Paphios),Cyprus,34.4,32.35,888,4487,"1019 . Paphos (Paphios) Map 72 . Lat. 34 . 40 , long. 32 . 35 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Πάφος , ηasper (Alcm. fr. 55 , PMG ; Hdt. 7 . 195 ). The city-ethnic is Πάφιος (Hdt. 7 . 195 ). Paphos appears as a kingdom, 'Pappa' , in the lists of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal (Borger ( 1956 ) no. 60 . 66 ); whether the men from 'Pappa' (or 'Papa') mentioned in the annals of Sargon are Paphians, Anatolians or Urartians is still uncertain: see Reyes ( 1994 ) 56 . It is called a polis , possibly in the political sense, at Aesch. Pers . 892 . It must also be one of the unnamed Cypriot poleis mentioned in the urban sense at Hdt. 5 . 115 . Paphos also appears as a polis in the urban sense in an inscription ( c. 321 -309 ) of the last king, Nikokles, which refers to the defences of the ευρυacuteχορος πόλις (Maier ( 1959 ) 207 no. 58 ; Mitford ( 1960 ) 203 ; CEG ii 869 ). The individual use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Hdt. 7 . 195 , the collective use internally on coins of King Timarchos c. 350 -c. 325 ( Πα [ φίων ]: ICS 29 ) and Nikokles ( Παφίων : Masson ( 1968 b )). Paphos took part in the Ionian Revolt and was besieged and taken by the Persians (Hdt. 5 . 115 . 1 -2 ). Elaborate siege and counter-siege works recovered by excavation allow a detailed reconstruction of the operations (Maier and Karageorghis ( 1984 ) 194 -203 ; Maier ( 1996 ) 125 -27 ). A Paphian contingent of twelve ships, commanded by Penthylos, fought in the Persian fleet of 480 (Hdt. 7 . 195 ). Paphos became an ally of Alexander the Great in 332 (Arr. Anab . 2 . 20 . 3 , by implication). The kings of Paphos traced their origin to the legendary founder-king Kinyras; they alone in Cyprus combined political power with the cult functions of high priest of Aphrodite (Maier ( 1989 b )). Two syllabic inscriptions of King Nikokles ( ICS 8 ; AAP 4 , 237 ) are fragments of oaths,but do not (as suggested by Mehl ( 1996 a ) 141 ) represent a kind of treaty between the king and his subjects. Paphos was defended by a circuit of walls with rectangular towers, built in C8l and maintained until about 300 (remodelled C6l, repaired C4m: Maier and Karageorghis ( 1984 ) 128 -70 , 209 -12 ; Maier and von Wartburg ( 1985 ) 153 -55 ; cf. CEG ii 869 (C4l)); it enclosed an area of c. 45 ha. A large C6 -C5 ashlar building, reminiscent of Achaemenid prototypes, seems to have been a royal palace; a large C4s peristyle mansion may have served public functions (Schäfer ( 1960 ); Maier ( 1989 a ) 17 ). An imposing chamber tomb was the burial place of two C4s kings of Paphos, Timocharis and Echetimos (Maier and von Wartburg ( 1998 ) 105 -10 ; AAP 5 ). Aphrodite, the 'Wanassa'of the syllabic inscriptions, was the protective goddess of Paphos (Hom. Od . 8 . 362 -66 ; Hymn. Hom . Ven . 56 -67 ). Her main shrine was an open court sanctuary (C12 to fourth century ad ), but of its Archaic and Classical period only votive statuettes survive (Maier and Karageorghis ( 1984 ) 182 -83 ; Maier and von Wartburg ( 1985 ) 155 -56 ). Outside the intricate north-east gate stood an Archaic sanctuary, dedicated possibly to Aphrodite/Astarte and Melquart/Baal and destroyed in 498 / 7 (Maier and Karageorghis ( 1984 ) 186 -92 ). The kings of Paphos struck silver coins on the Persian standard C6lc. 325 ; Nikokles ( c. 325 -c. 309 ) used the Attic standard. Denominations: stater and fractions down to 1 / 24 th. Principal types: obv . human-headed bull; rev . astragalos, or head of eagle, or obv . bull walking or standing; rev . eagle standing or flying, or obv . Zeus(?) seated on throne; rev . Aphrodite(?) sacrificing, or obv . head or bust of Aphrodite wearing crown; rev . Apollo seated on omphalos. Legends are name of king in syllabic script, except for Nikokleous Paphion in alphabetic Greek (Babelon, Traité ii. 2 nos. 1278 -1327 ; Head, HN ² 740 -41 ; Schwabacher ( 1947 ) 85 -87 , 101 -2 nos. 224 -43 ; May ( 1952 ); Masson ( 1983 ) 115 -23 ; Gesche ( 1970 ) 169 , 191 -93 ; SNG Cop. Cyprus 25 -30 , Suppl . 628 ). The traditional founder of sanctuary and town was the Arkadian king Agapenor of Tegea (Paus. 8 . 5 . 2 ; cf. Roy ( 1987 ); Strabo 14 . 6 . 3 ); but another tradition names the indigenous King Kinyras as the mythical founder (Pind. Pyth . 2 . 15 -17 ; Nem . 8 . 16 -18 ). The cult of Aphrodite and the Archaic sculpture of Paphos show definite Phoenician influences, but traces of Phoenician presence are lacking so far (Masson and Sznycer ( 1972 ) 81 -86 )."
1020,Salamis (Salaminios),Cyprus,35.1,33.55,1020,4842,"1020 . Salamis (Salaminios) Map 72 . Lat. 35 . 10 , long. 33 . 55 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Σαλα µ ίς , ηasper (Hdt. 4 . 162 ; Thuc. 1 . 112 . 4 ). The city-ethnic is Σαλα µ ίνιος (Hdt. 5 . 104 . 1 -2 ) or Σελα µ ίνιος ( ICS 323 (C5 )). Salamis appears as a kingdom,'Silli' , in the lists of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal (Borger ( 1956 ) no. 60 . 67 ). It is called a polis in the political sense at Aesch. Pers . 893 and Isoc. Paneg . 141 , 9 . 19 and 3 . 32 . Salamis is mentioned as a polis in the urban sense by Hdt. 5 . 104 . 3 , 115 . 1 ; Isoc. 9 . 20 , 47 and 3 . 28 ; Ps.-Skylax 103 . τοgrave άστυ τοgrave Σαλα µ ινίων is found at Hdt. 5 . 104 . 2 . The term Polites is found in Isoc. 9 . 30 -31 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Hdt. 5 . 104 . 1 -2 and internally on coins of King Nikodamos (C5e?): syllabic se-la-mi-ni ( Σελα µ ινί ( ων )) in ICS 323 ; the individual use is found externally in Hdt. 5 . 108 . 1 and SEG 29 296 (C5 ). The Greek dynasty of Salamis traced its ancestry back to the legendary hero Teukros, son of Telamon, king of the Greek Salamis (Pind. Nem . 4 . 46 -48 ; Paus. 1 . 3 . 2 , 2 . 29 . 4 ; Pouilloux ( 1975 ) 111 -15 ). Salamis joined the Ionian Revolt (Hdt. 5 . 104 -15 ) after King Gorgos had been expelled by a faction ( stasiotai ) led by his younger brother Onesilos (Hdt. 5 . 104 ). The desertion of its war chariots led to the defeat of the Cypriots in the battle of the πεδίον τοgrave Σαλα µ ινίων (Hdt. 5 . 110 ), but Salamis was granted exemption from the retaliatory measures of the Persian army (Hdt. 5 . 115 . 1 ). At the end of the Athenian operations in the eastern Mediterranean in 450 / 49 , a combined action on land and sea was fought off Salamis (Thuc. 1 . 112 . 4 ; Isoc. 8 . 86 ). King Euagoras I ( 410 -374 / 3 ) strengthened the fortifications, enlarged the harbour and built a fleet of triremes (Isoc. 9 . 47 ). In 351 / 0 -350 / 49 Salamis was besieged by Persian forces (Diod. 16 . 42 . 3 -9 , 46 . 1 -3 ). King Pnytagoras joined Alexander the Great in the siege of Tyros in 332 and lost his quinquireme (Arr. Anab . 2 . 22 . 2 ); in 331 he acted as choregos at Alexander's victory celebrations (Plut. Alex . 29 . 1 ). His son Nitaphon served as trierarchos on the Indian expedition (Arr. Ind . 18 . 1 -2 . 8 (r 326 )). In 323 / 2 King Nikokreon was appointed theorodokos to host theoroi from Nemea (Miller ( 1988 ) 148 . 3 -4 ). King Euagoras I was given Athenian citizenship in 410 or 409 ; he was made proxenos in 393 / 2 (Pouilloux ( 1975 ) 117 -18 ; Maier ( 1994 ) 313 -14 ). The monumental remains of Archaic and Classical Salamis, besides the sumptuous 'princely' C8 -C7 dromos tombs (Karageorghis ( 1969 ) 23 -150 and ( 1967 -71 )), are scanty. They consist mainly of a short section of the southern defences which possibly included a gate. The stone and mudbrick wall was erected in the Archaic period on Protogeometric foundations (C11 ?), and destroyed by fire in C6 (Jehasse ( 1980 )). Inside the wall the remains of a sanctuary of the 'Great God of Salamis' , dating to the same period, were discovered; a C5 -C4 rural sanctuary of the Great Goddess was situated outside the walls to the west of the city (Yon ( 1993 ) 144 -46 ). The most important cult of Salamis was that of Zeus Salaminios, said to have been founded by Teukros and regarded by Tacitus as nearly as prominent as that of the Paphian Aphrodite ( Ann . 3 . 62 . 4 ). The kings of Salamis struck silver coins on the Persian standard from c. 530 / 20 (Euelthon) to c. 310 (Nikokreon,who also used the Rhodian standard). Denominations: stater and fractions down to twelfth. From 411 coins of gold and bronze were struck too. Principal types: obv . recumbent ram, or ram's head; rev . ankh, or smooth; or obv . head of bearded Herakles in lion skin; rev . forepart of recumbent goat, or goat's head; or obv . bust or head of crowned Aphrodite; rev . helmeted head of Athena, or head of crowned Aphrodite; or obv . forepart of galloping horse; rev . ram's head; or obv . ram's head; rev . lion's head; or obv . helmeted head of Athena; rev . lion walking, or lion's head; or obv . head of Aphrodite; rev . head or bust of Euagoras II; or obv . head of Artemis; rev . head of Aphrodite; or obv . head of Aphrodite in turreted crown; rev . head of Apollo.

Cyprus 31 -62 ). Ps.-Skylax 103 calls Salamis a ( polis ) ' Ελληνίς ; its society and culture were basically Greek, although there existed a small Phoenician colony there (Karageorghis ( 1969 ) 12 , 149 ; Masson and Sznycer ( 1972 ) 123 -28 ; Pouilloux et al .

Soloi appears as a kingdom, 'Sillua' , in the lists of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal (Borger ( 1956 ) no. 60 . 65 ). It is called a polis in the political sense by Solon fr. 19 . 2 , West, and Aesch. Pers . 892 ; in the urban sense by Hdt. 5 . 115 . 2 and Ps.-Skylax 103 . The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested externally in Solon fr. 7 . 1 , Diehl, and Hdt. 5 . 110 , 113 . 2 . Soloi was founded, according to Strabo 14 . 6 . 3 , by the Athenians Phaleros and Akamas. Soloi took part in the Ionian Revolt, and King Aristkypros was killed in the battle of Salamis (Hdt. 5 . 104 . 1 , by implication); the city was besieged and taken by the Persians in 498 / 7 (Hdt. 5 . 115 . 1 -2 ). That the city was afterwards for a time controlled by a 'Persophile king' of Marion remains an unproved hypothesis (Maier ( 1985 ) 36 -37 , ( 1989 a ) 18 ; Collombier ( 1991 ) 31 -32 ). In 391 it was allied with Amathous (no. 1012 ) and Kition against Euagoras I of Salamis (Ephor. fr. 76 ; Diod. 14 . 98 . 2 ; Maier ( 1994 ) 314 -15 ): after the Cypriot rulers had sided with Alexander the Great in 332 (Arr. Anab . 2 . 20 . 3 ; Plut. Alex . 24 . 2 ), King Pasikrates acted as choregos at Alexander's victory celebrations in 331 (Plut. Alex . 29 . 2 ); his son Nikokles served as trierarchos on the Indian expedition (Arr. Ind . 18 . 1 -2 . 8 (r 326 )). In 323 / 2 King Stasikrates was appointed theorodokos to host theoroi from Nemea (Miller ( 1988 ) 148 . 9 -10 ). ## II. The Poleis ## 1 . Syria"
1022,Posideion,From Syria to the Pillars of Herakles,35.5,35.5,585,2997,"1022 . Posideion Map 68 . Lat. 35 . 50 , long. 35 . 50 . Size of territory: 1 ? Type:A: β . The toponym is Ποσιδήιον , τό (Hdt. 3 . 91 . 1 ) or Ποσείδιον (Strabo 16 . 2 . 8 ); Ποσείδειον at Ps.Skylax 102 is an emendation of MS Ποσειθέριον . No cityethnic is attested in the full form apart from Steph. Byz. 533 . 12 . The identification of Posideion with Bassit has long ⁷ Ps.-Skylax 111 contains a large number of place-names that are unknown from other sources; see the list in Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 165 . been considered probable from the similarity of name (cf. Riis ( 1970 ) 137 -38 ; Courbin ( 1986 ) 187 -88 and 206 -7 ). Posideion is first mentioned by Hdt. 3 . 91 . 1 as a polis founded by Amphilochos, son of Amphiaraos, on the borders between the Kilikians and the Syrians-in other words, a foundation that was believed to go back to the Bronze Age, and which Herodotos presented as Greek. Since the C7 poet Kallinos of Ephesos (cited by Strabo 14 . 4 . 3 ) alluded to the settlement of the followers of Amphilochos in Kilikia and Syria as far as Phoinike, it is probable that the story of the foundation of Posideion by them was already in circulation by his time. Courbin ( 1986 ) 194 suggests that the story does not reflect an actual Greek settlement of the late Bronze Age, for which there is no archaeological confirmation, but was invented in C8s as a legitimation for the Greek presence at the site which begins at that time. For Greek heroic legends connected with the Levant cf. Riis ( 1970 ) 137 -42 . Strabo mentions Posideion at 16 . 2 . 8 and 12 , where it is called a πολίχνιον , while Steph. Byz. 533 . 12 refers to it as a polis for which he gives the ethnic Ποσειδειευacuteς , though this information may be merely constructed from Herodotos. Archaeological evidence has shown that Ras el Bassit had a continuous existence through to Heltic and Roman times, but it clearly was in origin a Levantine site to which the Greeks came late (C8s), and which in the Archaic and Classical periods was not purely Greek, though it became a Greek polis (Courbin ( 1986 ); Perreault ( 1993 ) 69 -71 , though he obscures the character of Posideion as a Greek polis ). Archaeology has not revealed for this time any public buildings,cultic places or city walls (Courbin ( 1986 ) 203 ). The settlement developed in the Heltic period, and there is now evidence of fortifications (Courbin ( 1986 ) 206 -9 ). In C3m it is referred to in the Gurob papyrus ( FGrHist 160i § 3 ), where it is described as a φρουacuteριον . It is also mentioned by Diod. 34 / 35 . 28 . 1 , 2 (r 123 ), though without indication of its character. Posideion struck coins of silver (drachm on the Attic standard) and bronze in C4s. Only a few are known, identified by the legend ΠΟΣΙ∆ or ΠΟΣΙ∆Ε on the reverse. The types are: obv . seated deity (Baal of Tarsos); rev . head of a Kabeiros or Poseidon with trident (Head, HN ² 785 ; Courbin ( 1986 ) 205 -6 ; Le Rider ( 1986 ) 400 -3 ). ## 2 . Egypt"
1023,Naukratis (Naukratites),From Syria to the Pillars of Herakles,30.55,30.35,2359,12038,"1023 . Naukratis (Naukratites) Map 74 . Lat. 30 . 55 , long. 30 . 35 . Size of territory: unknown. Type: A: β . The toponym is Ναυacuteκρατις , ηasper , attested on dedications at Naukratis of C6 (Bernand ( 1970 ), 683 no. 419 , 744 -45 no. 5 ; Lazzarini ( 1976 ), nos. 175 , 177 c), in Herodotos ( 2 . 97 . 2 , 135 . 5 , 178 . 1 , 179 ) and on a Rhodian proxeny decree ( Lindos ii no. 16 . 4 -5 (C5l)), and frequently thereafter. The city-ethnic is Ναυκρατίτης , doubtfully restored on a C6 vase dedication (Bernand ( 1970 ), 708 no. 670 ), and first securely attested on an Attic tombstone dated to C5l ( IG ii² 9984 ). There are further examples on inscriptions of C4 , at Athens ( IG ii² 163 . 1 (C4f), 206 . 7 -8 , 20 (C4m), 9985 -87 (C4f)), at Delphi ( CID ii 4 . i . 37 , iii . 21 , 24 , ii 10 fr. B. 1 , 3 , 5 ), and at Ephesos ( I.Eph 1424 . 1 ( 323 -321 )). The form [ Ν ] αοκρατίτης is also found ( I.Eph 1425 . 1 ( 323 -321 ); on the date, cf. Keil ( 1923 ) 238 -39 , 244 ). Steph. Byz. 470 . 12 -15 also mentions the form Ναυκρατιώτης , but there is no attestation of this. The external use of the city-ethnic is found collectively in the Delphic naopoioi accounts ( CID ii 4 . i . 37 ( 360 s)) and individually in Attic sepulchral inscriptions ( IG ii² 9587 -89 (C4f)). An early literary example of the non-political use of Ναυκρατίτης is in Anakreon (fr. 89 , Page PMG ; Campbell, Greek Lyric ii ( 1988 ) 106 no. 434 ). Literary examples of the city-ethnic in the political sense are all post-Classical. For example,Plutarch introduces οasper Ναυκρατίτης Νειλόξενος in a C6 context ( Mor . 146 E), allegedly an intimate of Solon and Thales in Egypt (cf. also repeatedly in Athenaios, himself a Naukratite, e.g. 3 . 73 A, 4 . 149 D). Naukratis was without doubt a polis in the period after Alexander: an honorific decree of probably C2f was passed by ηasper πόλις ηasper Ναυκρατιτ [ ῶν ] ( OGIS 120 ; Bernand ( 1970 ) 751 -72 no. 15 ), and later writers assume that it was a polis that had been founded in the same way as others in the Archaic period (Strabo 17 . 1 . 18 ; Steph. Byz. 470 . 12 -15 citing Strabo; Suda s.v. Ναυacuteκρατις ). But whether it can be reckoned to have been a polis in the Archaic and Classical periods continues to be debated (for Naukratis as a polis cf. Roebuck ( 1951 ), followed by Sherk ( 1992 ) 259 -60 and 268 -69 ; Austin ( 1970 ) 29 -33 ; Hansen ( 1997 a ) 91 -94 , ( 1997 b ) 29 , 32 -33 ; against: Bresson ( 1980 ); Bowden ( 1996 ) 29 -30 ). Herodotos is the earliest author to call Naukratis a polis already in C6 ( 2 . 178 . 1 ): Φιλέλλην δεgrave γενό µ ενος οasper Αacute µ ασις άλλα τε ες ' Ελλήνων µ ετεξετέρους απεδέξατο καιgrave δηgrave καιgrave τοῖσι απικνεο µ ένοισι ες Αίγυπτον έδωκε Ναυacuteκρατιν πόλιν ενοικηtildeσαι . There may be a very indirect reference to Naukratis as a polis in 2 . 180 . 2 , where the Delphians visit the poleis and receive contributions from Amasis and from 'the Greeks living in Egypt' , a reference which must include Naukratis (compare the same phrase in the Rhodian decree Lindos ii cols. 212 -14 , referring to Naukratis). It has been questioned whether Herodotos is using the word polis strictly (Bresson ( 1980 ) 292 -93 ; Bowden ( 1996 ) 29 -30 ), but he is otherwise consistent in applying the word to Greek communities that were poleis in the political as well as the urban sense (Hansen ( 1996 b ) 23 -34 , 39 -54 ). Inscriptions of the Classical period provide conclusive evidence from the use of the city-ethnic Ναυκρατίτης , found on tombstones of metics in Athens ( IG ii² 9984 -87 (C5l-C4 )), in a proxeny decree from Delphi for Naukratites ( F.Delphes iii . 1 419 (C4l?)), from two Athenian proxeny decrees for Naukratites ( IG ii² 163 . 1 (C4f), 206 . 7 -8 , 20 ( 349 / 8 )), and from two decrees from Ephesos granting citizenship to Naukratites ( I.Eph 1424 , 1425 ). Furthermore, in the Delphic naopoioi accounts the Naukratitai are listed as a community under the heading πόλεις καιgrave ιδιῶται ( CID ii 4 . i . 37 , 4 . iii . 21 , 24 , 10 fr. B. 1 , 3 , 5 ( 369 -363 )). It has been denied that these ethnics indicate political status as opposed merely to place of origin (Bresson ( 1980 ) 316 -17 , 332 no. 84 ; Bowden ( 1996 ) 30 ), but this is not consistent with the evidence for ethnics on Attic tombstones or for the institution of the proxeny (Hansen ( 1996 a ) 184 -85 , cf. 177 -80 ; Hansen ( 1997 a ) 91 -94 ). Note also the notorious Kleomenes of Naukratis, appointed as financial official in Egypt by Alexander in 332 / 1 (Berve ( 1926 ) no. 431 ), who is described as Ναυκρατίτης by Ps.-Callisthenes 1 . 31 , though only as εκ Ναυκράτιος at Arr. Anab . 3 . 5 . 4 . Naukratis was an unusual community in a special position. Established by a multiplicity of different Greeks as an enclave within Egyptian territory, on the eastern side of the Canobic branch of the Nile, and some 70 km from the sea (cf. Bernand ( 1970 ) 615 -25 on its position), it was dependent for its existence and prosperity on the continued good will of the rulers of Egypt, from the pharaohs to the Romans. It could not engage in any independent political activity,and if it was a polis already in the Archaic and Classical periods, it belonged to the category of poleis that were dependent (Hansen ( 1997 b ) 29 , 32 -33 ). Uncertainty also surrounds the exact role of Miletos (no. 854 ) in the early history of Naukratis. Post-Classical evidence unanimously attributes the 'foundation' of Naukratis (if 'foundation' is an appropriate concept; cf. Austin ( 1970 ) 22 ; Malkin ( 1987 ) 130 -31 ) to Miletos exclusively. This applies not only to the literary sources (Strabo 17 . 1 . 18 ; Eusebios, ed. Schoene, ii. 81 ; Steph. Byz. 470 . 12 -15 ; Suda s.v. Ναυacuteκρατις ), but also to epigraphic evidence from Miletos itself, which reproduces a version of events traceable to the Heltic period (Austin ( 1970 ) 22 and n. 5 ). The Milesian origin of Naukratis has often been accepted (Lloyd ( 1975 ) 24 -25 ; Braun ( 1982 ) 37 -38 ; Ehrhardt ( 1983 ) 87 -90 , 119 (in a qualified form); Haider ( 1988 ) 184 -99 , 211 ; Sherk ( 1992 ) 259 -60 and 268 -69 ), but this does not harmonise with the more complex account of Herodotos, which does not give any specially prominent role to Miletos in the origins of Naukratis. There is thus a case for regarding this tradition as a construct of the Heltic period (Austin ( 1970 ) 23 , followed by Bresson ( 1980 ) 315 -16 ). Ehrhardt ( 1983 ) 89 -90 and 119 argues for Milesian participation in the 'foundation' of Naukratis from the Milesian calendar of Antinoopolis which derived its laws from Naukratis (Wilcken ( 1912 ) no. 27 ), but it is not certain how far back these date (cf. Bowden ( 1996 ) 25 -26 ). Nothing is known of the territory of Naukratis, if indeed it had a territory of its own beyond the area of urban settlement with its sanctuaries, houses and workshops, to the north of the Egyptian town and covering an area of c. 800 m from south to north and 400 m from west to east (Bernand ( 1970 ) 857 -63 ; on the question of Naukratis' territory cf. Bresson ( 1980 ) 325 n. 12 ; Boardman ( 1994 ) 140 ; Bowden ( 1996 ) 30 -31 ). Hdt. 2 . 178 -79 appears to present Naukratis in C6 as a double community, at once a πόλις and an ε µ πόριον (cf. Austin ( 1970 ) 29 -30 ; Malkin ( 1987 ) 130 -31 ; Hansen ( 1997 a ) 91 -94 ), which comprised a polis of residents on the one hand, and non-resident traders who were not part of the polis on the other. The latter included the founders of the Hellenion: viz . the Ionian cities of Chios (no. 840 ), T eos (no. 868 ), Phokaia (no. 859 ) and Klazomenai (no. 847 ), the Dorian cities of Rhodos, Knidos (no. 903 ), Halikarnassos (no. 886 ) and Phaselis (no. 942 ), and the Aeolian city of Mytilene (no. 798 ). According to him, these had the exclusive right of appointing the προστάται τουtilde ε µ πορίου , whose precise functions cannot be defined (Roebuck ( 1951 ); Bresson ( 1980 ) 311 -15 ; Sherk ( 1992 ) 268 -69 ; Bowden ( 1996 ) 32 -34 ). Roebuck ( 1951 ) argued that the prostatai must have been appointed by the traders on the spot, and not by the Greek cities at home,as stated by Herodotos; but see Bresson ( 1980 ) 311 -15 . Late evidence mentions the existence of a πρυτανεῖον where communal festivals were celebrated on the birthday of Hestia Prytanitis, at the Dionysia and at the πανήγυρις for Apollo Komaios (Miller ( 1978 ) 11 , 12 -13 , 16 , 199 -200 ; Bresson ( 1980 ) 344 n. 161 ), and officials called τι µ ουtildeχοι (Gottlieb ( 1968 ) 28 -30 ) had the power to inflict fines on offenders (Ath. 4 . 149 D-F, citing Hermeias FHG ii 80 -81 ). The identity and date of Hermeias, Athenaios' source, are uncertain, and he need not be identical with the C4 historian Hermeias of Methymna ( FGrHist 558 ). It is therefore not clear whether this evidence can be projected back to the Classical or the Archaic periods (as by Sherk ( 1992 ) 259 -60 and 268 -69 ; Hansen ( 1997 a ) 92 , ( 1997 b ) 33 ). According to Herodotos the Hellenion, founded jointly by several Greek cities of Asia Minor, was the largest, bestknown and most frequented of the sanctuaries at Naukratis. Healso mentions ( 2 . 178 . 2 ) separate foundations of a sanctuary of Zeus by the Aiginetans (no. 358 ), one of Hera by the Samians (no. 864 ), and one of Apollo by the Milesians (no. 854 ). Excavations have to some extent confirmed and supplemented this evidence, though important areas of uncertainty persist. On the basis of the numerous inscribed dedications on vases (cf. Lazzarini ( 1976 ) 177 , index p. 326 ), remains of all the sanctuaries mentioned by Herodotos have been identified, except for that of Zeus founded by the Aiginetans (Bernand ( 1970 ) 817 -49 ; Boardman ( 1980 ) 118 -29 ; though cf. Bowden ( 1996 ) esp. 18 -28 for a sceptical view, doubting the identification of the Hellenion and the sanctuary of Hera). Dedications to Apollo, sometimes specifically described as Milesian, are the most numerous to have survived (Bernand ( 1970 ) 772 for comparative figures). Another sanctuary, of Aphrodite and probably founded by Chios (no. 840 ), is not mentioned by Herodotos, though from its position in the south of the town it is likely to have been the earliest to be founded (Bernand ( 1970 ) 829 -37 ; Boardman ( 1980 ) 119 -20 ; Bresson ( 1980 ) 313 -14 ). Extant dedications to Aphrodite are second in importance to those to Apollo, and late evidence tells of the popularity of the cult in early times, allegedly already in the Twenty-third Olympiad, i.e. 688 -685 (Ath. 15 . 675 F-76 C from Polycharmos ( FGrHist 640 ) fr. 1 ; Bernand ( 1970 ) 772 , 774 , 829 -37 ). Later evidence (above) also mentions cults of Hestia Prytanitis, Dionysos and Apollo Komaios. The archaeological evidence has thus not revealed the existence of any civic sanctuaries distinct from those set up by the traders themselves, and they seem to have been used by all members of the community on the spot (cf. Burkert ( 1995 ) 206 ). Without exception the remains of all the sanctuaries are poorly preserved. Excavation has not revealed either the existence of any city wall. Civic architecture (a πρυτανεῖον ) is implied by later literary evidence (Ath. 4 . 149 D-F; see supra ), but it has not been located (cf.Bernand ( 1970 ) 857 -63 on Naukratis as a town).Little is known of the Egyptian part of the town to the south, and the archaeological evidence was interpreted in different ways by the excavators themselves (Bernand ( 1970 ) 849 -57 ). It has even been argued that the Greeks may have been the first to settle at Naukratis (Boardman ( 1994 ) 139 ; cf. Möller ( 2000 )). The sanctuaries of Naukratis remain the best-known part of a badly known site. Only a few isolated bronze coins of Naukratis survive (Head, HN ² 845 ). Type: obv . wreathed female head (Aphrodite?), legend underneath ΝΑΥ ; rev . unidentified wreathed head, legend underneath ΑΛΕ . The coins thus date from the time of Alexander the Great (not earlier than 332 / 1 )."
1024,Oasis,From Syria to the Pillars of Herakles,,,106,542,"1024 . Oasis Not in Barr . Type: A. α . The toponym is /acuteΟασις (Hdt. 3 . 26 . 1 ) and the site is classified as a πόλις in the urban sense (ibid.). Herodotos is the only writer to allude to this settlement. He describes Oasis as lying 7 days' journey from Egyptian Thebes and being occupied by Samians said to be of the 'tribe' Aischrione (cf. Chamoux ( 1953 ) 63 -66 ; Jones, POAG 195 on Herodotos' probably non-technical use of the word 'tribe').On the other hand,he may be correct in describing the settlement as a polis . ## 3 . Libya"
1025,Barke (Barkaios),From Syria to the Pillars of Herakles,32.3,20.55,1395,6956,"1025 . Barke (Barkaios) Map 38 . Lat. 32 . 30 , long. 20 . 55 . Size of territory: 4 or 5 . Type: A: α . The toponym is Βάρκη , ηasper (Hdt. 3 . 91 . 2 , 4 . 160 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 108 ; Diod. 1 . 68 . 2 from Hekataios of Abdera ( FGrHist 264 ) fr. 25 ; testimonia in Purcaro Pagano ( 1976 ) 330 -31 ). Hrd., De prosodia catholica 3 , 1 272 . 16 -17 and Steph. Byz. 159 . 11 both state that it was also called Βάρκαια , though this is not attested otherwise. The city-ethnic is Βαρκαῖος (Hdt. 3 . 13 . 3 , 4 . 164 . 4 ; Ps.-Skylax 108 ; Polyaen. 7 . 28 . 1 (rC5e)), sometimes Βαρκαιευacuteς ( BGU vi 1280 . 10 , x 1943 . 5 , 25 (Ptolemaic)). Steph. Byz. loc. cit. also gives Βαρκαιάτης , for which there is no known example. In C3 , in the reign of Ptolemy III, the harbour of Barke was renamed Ptolemais and elevated to the status of a polis , while Barke itself was subordinated to Ptolemais (see supra ). But the use of the name Barke survived, as shown by references in post-Classical authors (e.g. Strabo 17 . 3 . 20 , 21 ; Plin. HN 5 . 32 ) and by documents ( P Lond. vii 1986 r 4 , 13 , 17 (C3 ); cf. Laronde ( 1987 ) 396 -97 ). The earliest references to Barke as a polis are in Herodotos, who uses the word in various senses. In 4 . 160 . 1 and in 4 . 202 . 2 he uses it primarily in the political sense. In 4 . 200 . 1 -2 and 203 . 2 he refers to it in the urban sense, emphasising that Barke was a Hellenic polis . Ps.-Skylax 108 uses the word in the urban sense. Strabo, who at 17 . 3 . 20 implies that Barke was a polis , describes her at 17 . 3 . 21 as one of several πολίχνια that were περιπόλια of Kyrene (no. 1028 ). Hdt. 4 . 201 . 3 refers to the άστυ of Barke. The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally on coins ( infra ), and externally in Hdt. 3 . 13 . 3 (and repeatedly in 4 . 167 . 2 and 200 -5 ). For the individual and external use of the city-ethnic see I.Délos i 298 A. 61 , 313 a. 51 (C3s). The territory is called Βαρκαίη (Hdt. 4 . 171 ). Its exact extent is not known, and fluctuated at different periods. It was certainly large and second in size only to that of Kyrene, though less well-watered (cf. Laronde ( 1987 ) 49 -51 for a comparison with Kyrene, 259 -60 on climate and rainfall). It reached to the sea, where its harbour lay some 30 km away to the east, and in C5 its control extended along the coast westward over Taucheira (no. 1029 ) (Hdt. 4 . 171 where Taucheira is described as πόλις τηtildeς Βαρκαίης ), though Taucheira seems to have recovered its independence subsequently (Laronde ( 1987 ) 62 -63 ). Ps.-Skylax 108 refers to the control exercised by Barke westwards as far as Eu(h)esperides (no. 1026 ) (cf. Laronde ( 1987 ) 200 -2 ). Founded by brothers of Arkesilas II of Kyrene in conflict with him (Hdt. 4 . 160 . 1 ), Barke was from the start in opposition to Kyrene and frequently followed a different political line (Laronde ( 1987 ) 49 , 211 , 252 ). C. 514 a Persian expedition invited by Pheretime, mother of Arkesilas III (Hdt. 4 . 165 , 167 ), captured Barke after a siege and exposed the city to an andrapodismos (Hdt. 4 . 203 . 1 , 204 ) in which she executed the opponents of the Battiads and enslaved a large part of the population (Hdt. 4 . 200 -2 ). They were deported to Bactria by Darius and settled in a village to which they gave the name Barke, which was still inhabited in Herodotos' time ( 4 . 204 ). The population of Barke must have recovered subsequently, since Barke enjoyed a period of prosperity in C5 , as shown by its abundant coinage, though after the second quarter of C4she was eclipsed by Kyrene (Laronde ( 1987 ) 49 -50 , 162 ). C. 390 -386 Barke was in alliance with Evagoras of Salamis (no. 1020 ) and King Akoris of Egypt against the Persians (Theopomp. fr. 103 ; Staatsverträge 237 ). Together with Eu(h)esperides, Barke was in alliance with Thibron in his war with Kyrene in 322 (Diod. 18 . 20 . 3 ; cf. Laronde ( 1987 ) 41 , 63 ). A league of the Greek cities in Libya has been postulated on the basis of a passage in the 'Stele of the ΣΥΛΑ ' ( SEG 20 716 . 8 (C4s); Laronde ( 1987 ) 150 ), but the evidence is not cogent (Laronde ( 1987 ) 156 -57 ). Little is known of the constitution and cults of Barke, though it is likely to have adopted many of the institutions of Kyrene. In the Bacchiad period Barke is mentioned as having been under a basileus of the name of Alazeir (Hdt. 4 . 164 . 4 ). The account in Polyaen. 7 . 28 of the siege of Barke at the time of the Persian Wars (Chamoux ( 1953 ) 164 -65 ) mentions the archontes of Barke, but without specific detail. In the Classical period Barke was probably oligarchic in character.An eponymous priest of Apollo is attested at Ptolemais (Barke) in the Roman period, and may have derived from Kyrene in earlier times (Sherk ( 1992 ) 271 -72 ). Barke may have been named in a catalogue of theorodokoi of the Heraia at Argos (no. 347 ) ( SEG 23 189 ( c. 330 ), i ll. 16 -19 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 161 -62 , though cf. Charneux in BE ( 1988 ) no. 595 ). Amesinas of Barke won the wrestling match at Olympia in 460 ( Olympionikai 261 ). In his account of the siege of Barke by the Persians, Herodotos mentions the city wall which the Persians tried unsuccessfully to sap before they entered the city by a ruse ( 4 . 200 -2 ). In the other Persian siege of Barke at the time of the Persian War the city gates are mentioned again (Polyaen. 7 . 28 ; cf. Chamoux ( 1953 ) 164 -65 ). Little is known as yet of the archaeology of the site (Boardman ( 1966 ) 153 ). The coinage of Barke (mostly silver except for a scarce bronze coinage at the end of C4 ) developed along the same lines as that of Kyrene, and went through three main periods: c. 525 -480 , c. 480 -435 and c. 435 -308 , (see BMC Cyrenaica pp. clxiv-clxxxvii and 91 -106 ; cf. also Laronde ( 1987 ) 51 -52 ). At first Barke coined in silver on the Attic standard (tetradrachms, didrachms, fifths, later also tenths). Types: obv . silphium plant and/or fruit; rev . bull with palm tree, or ram's head, then head of Ammon as the most frequent type, legends sometimes ΒΑΡΚΑΙΟΝ but mostly abbreviated, sometimes down to Β . In the third period Barke switched to the Asiatic standard (tetradrachms, drachms, hemidrachms and fractional denominations).Types mostly: obv . silphium plant; rev . head of Ammon, same legends. A number of coins now bear magistrates' names as well, and a few invert the obverse and reverse types. Some silver issues of C5s have been described as 'alliance' coinages, in that they bear the city-ethnics of Kyrene (no. 1028 ) on the obverse and Barke on the reverse, or Taucheira (no. 1029 ) on the obverse and Barke on the reverse.The presence of the city-ethnic of Barke on the reverse suggests that Barke was at the time the predominant partner, which corresponds to the implications of Hdt. 4 . 171 for Taucheira, but the precise historical circumstances are not known (see BMC Cyrenaica pp. xliv-xlvi and 107 -8 )."
1026,Eu(h)esperides (Eu(h)esperites),From Syria to the Pillars of Herakles,32.07,20.05,1466,7123,"1026 . Eu(h)esperides (Eu(h)esperites) Map 38 . Lat. 32 . 07 , long. 20 . 05 . Size of territory: 2 ? Type: A: α (testimonia in Purcaro Pagano ( 1976 ) 331 , 335 ). The toponym is Ευεσπερίδες (Hdt. 4 . 171 ; Theophr. Hist. pl. 4 . 3 . 2 , 6 . 3 . 3 , 8 . 6 . 6 ; SEG 9 76 . 6 and Tod 203 (C4s); Steph. Byz. 284 . 19 -21 ) or ' Εσπερίδες , αιasper (Ps.-Skylax 108 -9 ; Heracl. Lemb. 17 ; Theotimos of Kyrene ( FGrHist 470 ) fr. 1 (C2 ); Strabo 10 . 2 . 18 ). Steph. Byz. 282 . 16 -17 , who draws attention to the two forms of the name, does not mention the form ' Εσπερίδες , but gives the alternative form as ' Εσπερίς (cf. SEG 9362 . 7 = CEG ii 680 . 6 (C4 )). Similarly the city-ethnic is found in both forms, Ευεσπερίτης (Hdt. 4 . 198 . 3 ; Thuc. 7 . 50 . 2 ; Diod. 4 . 56 . 6 = Timaios ( FGrHist 566 ) fr. 85 § 6 ; CID ii 26 . 4 -7 ; cf. Laronde ( 1987 ) 148 ) and ' Εσπερίτης (Diod. 18 . 20 . 3 ; BGU x 1946 . 14 , 1956 . 5 , 1958 . 11 (all C3 ); SEG 9 362 . 1 (C4 ) has the feminine form ' Εσπερῖτις ). A C4s proxeny decree has the form Ευσπερίτης ( SEG 18 772 . 5 ). Ευεσπερίδες and Ευεσπερίτης are first attested in C5 in literary sources and (in abbreviated form) on the coinage, while ' Εσπερίς and ' Εσπερίτης are not found till C4 but become common thereafter. The earliest reference to Eu(h)esperides as a polis is in Ps.Skylax 108 , where it is described as both a polis and a λι µ ήν . There is no doubt that it was a polis in C5 and probably from the time of its foundation, as shown by the use of the cityethnic in Hdt. 4 . 198 . 2 and Thuc. 7 . 50 . 2 and later writers (Diod. 18 . 20 . 3 ; Paus. 4 . 26 . 2 -3 , 5 ), the coins it issued, which bear the city-ethnic, and from the historical record which shows it involved in active warfare with its Libyan neighbours (Thuc. 7 . 50 . 2 ; Paus. loc. cit. ). It is called patra ( = patris ) in SEG 9 362 . 7 (C4 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic is attested internally, mostly in an abbreviated form, by coins of Eu(h)esperides, and externally in literary sources (Hdt. 4 . 198 . 3 ; Thuc. 7 . 50 . 2 ). The external individual use is found in SEG 9 362 . 1 (C4 ). Colonists were sent to Eu(h)esperides by Arkesilas IV, i.e. in C5f (Theotimos of Kyrene ( FGrHist 470 ) fr. 1 (C2 ); Chamoux ( 1953 ) 173 -75 ), but the city had been founded well before this. Pottery dating to C6f has been found (Boardman ( 1966 ) 155 -56 ; Vickers and Gill ( 1986 ), who leave the chronology open), and Eu(h)esperides is first mentioned c. 514 during the Persian expedition to Libya (Hdt. 4 . 204 ). Though founded from Kyrene (no. 1028 ), it was often in conflict with its mother city.In C4s there is a dedication to Apollo at Kyrene by the strategos Aristis for victories won at sea, one of them εν Ευεσπερίδεσσι ( SEG 9 76 . 6 and Tod 203 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 66 -69 ). In C3 under Ptolemy III the site of Eu(h)esperides was abandoned and moved nearly 3 km to the coast; the new city, fortified from the start,was renamed Berenike,a name which supplanted the original one (Steph. Byz. 164 . 6 -9 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 382 -96 ). Strabo, who mentions Berenike several times, does not refer to the refoundation and renaming of the old city, which he does not name explicitly ( 17 . 3 . 20 , 21 ). The exact extent of the territory of Eu(h)esperides is not known, though it was certainly more restricted than that of Kyrene (no. 1028 ) or even Barke (no. 1025 ). Hdt. 4 . 198 . 3 probably exaggerates the fertility of the land. Eu(h)esperides was frequently in conflict with neighbouring Libyan tribes and welcomed support from Greeks of the mainland (Thuc. 7 . 50 . 2 ; Paus. 4 . 26 . 2 -3 ; cf. Chamoux ( 1953 ) 226 -27 , 230 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 27 , 52 ). Together with Barke, Eu(h)esperides was in alliance with Thibron in his war with Kyrene in 322 (Diod. 18 . 20 . 3 ; cf. Laronde ( 1987 ) 41 -42 , 49 , 63 , 211 ). For the alleged C4league of Greek cities in Libya, see supra under Barke (no. 1025 ). The political institutions of Eu(h)esperides probably reproduced those of her mother city Kyrene, though little detail is known.A proxeny decree for two Syracusans of C4s shows the existence of ephoroi and gerontes who introduce motions to the boule ( SEG 18 772 . 1 -2 ; cf. SEG 41 1693 ). In the Classical period the constitution was probably oligarchic in character. Little is known of the cults of Eu(h)esperides, beyond a dedication to Apollo of C4 (Laronde ( 1987 ) 394 ) and a C4 relief in honour of four local heroes ( SEG 9 769 ; Chamoux ( 1953 ) 279 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 390 fig. 141 and 411 n. 101 ). In the Roman period Eu(h)esperides had an eponymous priest of Apollo ( SEG 28 1540 ( 62 -61 ); cf. Sherk ( 1992 ) 271 -72 ), and this was probably derived from the institutions of Kyrene (no. 1028 ). It is not clear whether Eu(h)esperides was named in a catalogue of theorodokoi of the Heraia at Argos (no. 347 ) ( SEG 23 189 ( c. 330 ) i ll. 16 -19 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 161 -62 ; Charneux in BE ( 1988 ) no. 595 ). The urban planning seems to fall into two major phases, the first of C6e in the northern part of the site, the second, to the south and more large-scale, completed by C4e. The southern part of the city, unlike the earlier northern part, was laid out on a Hippodamian grid plan with space for an agora in the centre of a residential area. It dates from C4e, as do the extant parts of the city wall. The area enclosed by the city walls has been estimated as c. 21 ha at its maximum extent. Eu(h)esperides was besieged by the Libyans in 413 , which shows that the city was fortified by then (Thuc. 7 . 50 . 2 ); recent excavations have revealed a stretch of a fortification wall of 1 . 5 m width and a possible square tower, probably dating to C7l-C6e (Buzaian and Lloyd ( 1996 ) 143 -46 ). Because of silting, the harbour had to be moved westward away from the urban settlement by C4 , as shown by the distinction drawn by Ps.-Skylax 108 between the city and the port. The site has yielded sherds dating from C6e onwards (see Goodchild ( 1952 b ) 210 -11 ; Jones and Little ( 1971 ) 65 -67 ; Jones ( 1985 ) 28 -33 with figs. 3 . 1 -3 ; Lloyd ( 1985 ) esp. 51 -53 with figs. 5 . 1 and 5 . 2 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 389 -90 and fig. 142 ). Eu(h)esperides struck coins intermittently from C5e (C5m according to Buttrey ( 1994 ) 137 ), mostly silver on the Asiatic standard except for some bronze issues of C4l, and its coinage follows the same lines as those of Kyrene and Barke, though it was never abundant (see BMC Cyrenaica pp. clxxxviii-cxcvii and 109 -12 ). Types: obv . silphium plant; rev . dolphin, then head of Ammon,legends ΕΥ , ΕΥΕΣ (a tetradrachm has the full legend ΕΥΕΣΠΕΡΙΤΑΝ ). Other denominations: didrachm, drachm and hemidrachm. Some silver issues of C5s have been described as 'alliance' coinages, in that they bear the city-ethnics of Eu(h)esperides on the obverse and that of Kyrene (no. 1028 ) on the reverse. This suggests that Kyrene was at the time the predominant partner, and contrasts with the apparently subordinate position of Kyrene in relation to Barke (no. 1025 ) at the same period (see BMC Cyrenaica pp. xli-xlvi)."
1027,Kinyps,From Syria to the Pillars of Herakles,32.35,14.3,222,1034,"1027 . Kinyps Map 35 . Lat. 32 . 35 , long. 14 . 30 . Size of territory: ? Type: A: α . The toponym is Κίνυψ , -υπος or υφος , ηasper (Hdt. 4 . 198 . 1 ; Ps.-Skylax 109 ). No city-ethnic is attested. Kinyps is called a polis by Ps.-Skylax 109 . In about 512 , Dorieus, half-brother of King Kleomenes of Sparta (no. 347 ), led a band of followers to found a new settlement. He sailed first to Libya and settled in the land of Kinyps (some 18 km to the east of Lepcis Magna; cf. Hdt. 4 . 175 . 2 , 198 . 1 -2 on the reported fertility of its territory), though he was expelled after two years by the Libyan Maces and the Carthaginians (Hdt. 5 . 42 . 2 -3 ; cf. Chamoux ( 1953 ) 162 -63 ; Malkin ( 1994 ), 192 -203 ). Ps.-Skylax 109 refers to Kinyps as a πόλις έρη µ ος , which may simply be a mistake on his part (cf.Flensted-Jensen and Hansen ( 1996 ) 151 -53 , cf. 160 ). It is possible, however, that he is referring to the ruins of the short-lived settlement by Dorieus, which may still have been extant in C4 (Müller GGM i p. 85 )."
1028,Kyrene (Kyrenaios),From Syria to the Pillars of Herakles,32.5,21.52,4384,21387,"1028 . Kyrene (Kyrenaios) Map 38 . Lat. 32 . 50 , long. 21 . 52 . Size of territory: 5 . Type: A: α (some literary testimonia in Purcaro Pagano ( 1976 ) 339 ). The toponym is Κυρήνη , ηasper (Hdt. 2 . 181 . 4 -5 ; Thuc. 1 . 110 . 1 ), Doric Κυράνα (Pind. Pyth . 4 . 2 ; ML 5 . 6 ). ⁸ The city-ethnic is Κυρηναῖος (Hdt. 2 . 32 . 1 ; IG ii² 9124 (C4 )), feminine Κυρηναία ( IG ii² 9136 (C4 )). The Doric form Κυραναῖος seems to be attested only on inscriptions and coins ( CID ii 4 . iii . 11 ( 363 ); BMC Cyrenaica ). ⁸ Alone of the Greek cities in Libya, Kyrene preserved her original name throughout. On the name cf. Chamoux ( 1953 ) 126 -27 , and 275 -77 . Kyrene is first referred to as a polis in Pind. Pyth . 5 . 81 of 462 , then in Hdt. 4 . 156 . 3 , 164 . 3 , 203 . 1 . Pindar uses the word in the political sense. Herodotos uses the word in the urban sense at 4 . 164 . 3 and 4 . 203 . 1 , and in the territorial sense at 4 . 156 . 3 . Pindar refers to the άστυ of Kyrene in Pyth . 4 . 260 -61 , as does Hdt. at 2 . 181 . 5 and 4 . 203 . 1 . The first epigraphic attestations of Kyrene as a polis are in C4 , all of them in the political sense: ML 5 . 3 ; Tit. Cam. 105 . 10 -11 ; SEG 20 716 . 6 , 15 ; Tod 196 . 2 ( 330 -326 ). Patris is found in CEG ii 850 ( c. 335 ) and patra ( = patris ) in Pind. Pyth . 9 . 74 . The collective use of the city-ethnic internally is attested by the reverse of coins. The collective use of the city-ethnic externally is attested by several dedications ( SGDI 4838 ) (Archaic); Paus. 10 . 13 . 5 (rC5 ); 10 . 15 . 6 (rC5m)). The individual external use is frequently found, e.g. in Attika ( IG ii² 9124 , 9136 -39 ; tombstones (C4 )), and at Oropos (no. 214 ) ( IG vii 414 . 11 ( 366 -338 )). Starting from very modest beginnings (Hdt. 4 . 153 , 156 . 2 ), the population of Kyrene grew rapidly to become the largest of the Greek cities of Libya. Hdt. 4 . 160 . 3 gives a figure of 7 , 000 hoplites killed at the battle fought by Arkesilas II against Barke (no. 1025 ) and the Libyans. The diagramma of Ptolemy I in 322 / 1 defines a citizen body referred to as the 'Ten Thousand' , which was to replace a narrower body of 1 , 000 ( SEG 91 . 6 -15 , 35 and passim (cf. SEG 18 726 )). The total population of Kyrene, city and countryside included, has been estimated for C4 at around 300 , 000 (Laronde ( 1987 ) 340 , 342 , discussing earlier estimates; lower estimates in Goodchild ( 1971 ) 15 ). Even on a low figure, Kyrene was one of the most populous Greek states of her time. The original colonists came from Thera (no. 527 ) c. 631 (Chamoux ( 1953 ) 120 -24 ), though may have included others as well (cf. Paus. 3 . 14 . 3 ; Lindos Temple Chronicle ( FGrHist 532 ) § 17 ). In the reign of Battos II they were supplemented by colonists from the Peloponnese and the islands (cf. Hdt. 4 . 159 . 2 -3 , 161 . 3 ). Intermarriage with the Libyans was apparently common from the start (cf. Hdt. 4 . 186 . 2 ; Chamoux ( 1953 ) 129 ), and was recognised in the diagramma of Ptolemy I ( SEG 91 . 2 -3 ). Libyan influence on the Greek settlers is shown in many ways, though relations were ambivalent and ranged from co-operation to hostility (cf. Hdt. 4 . 158 -60 and numerous Libyan wars subsequently; cf. SEG 9 1 . 29 ), but Kyrene maintained her dominant position as well as her Hellenic character (cf. Chamoux ( 1953 ) 129 , 223 -24 ; Masson ( 1976 ) for the evidence of names). It is likely that the Kyrenaians were divided from the start into the three Dorian tribes, as were the Theraians (Jones, POAG 215 -16 ). Under Battos III, Demonax of Mantinea (no. 281 ) was called in as arbitrator to settle internal conflicts (Hdt. 4 . 161 . 1 -2 ); he redistributed the people into three tribes, making three parts ( moirai ) respectively of Theraians and perioikoi , Peloponnesians and Cretans, and all the islanders. This may refer to a redefinition of the composition of the pre-existing tribes, each tribe being composed of one of the three parts Herodotos mentions (cf. Chamoux ( 1953 ) 221 -24 on the perioikoi ; Jones, POAG 217 -18 ). Alternatively, Demonax may have made each of the three tribes comprise all three parts (Hölkeskamp ( 1993 )). Arist. Pol . 1319 b 1 -27 alludes to constitutional changes at Kyrene involving the organisation of the citizen body after the end of the monarchy, but date and details are obscure (Jones, POAG 218 -19 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 249 -52 ). The C4 decree on citizenship for Theraians resident at Kyrene specifies their assignment to phylai , patrai (phratries) and nine hetairai , the latter peculiar to Crete and Thera (ML 5 . 15 -16 ; Chamoux ( 1953 ) 214 ; Jones, POAG 219 ; Hölkeskamp ( 1993 ) 410 -13 ). Situated on a well-watered plateau, the territory of Kyrene, called ηasper Κυρηναίη χώρη by Hdt. 4 . 199 . 1 , was reputed for its fertility and formed the basis of Kyrene's great wealth (Hdt. 4 . 199 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 257 -323 ). The land was previously occupied by Libyan tribes, who were gradually pushed out. From early days, Kyrene showed a continuous tendency to expand, through the invitation to new Greek settlers (Hdt. 4 . 159 . 2 -4 ; cf. too 4 . 163 . 1 ) and new foundations, as that of Barke (Hdt. 4 . 160 . 1 ). The C4 decree for Theraians in Kyrene assumes the availability of unoccupied land for settlement (ML 5 . 33 ), and the diagramma of Ptolemy I mentions the establishment of new outposts by Kyrene to the east (described as πόλεις , SEG 9 1 . 4 -5 ; cf. Laronde ( 1987 ) 349 ). The territory of Kyrene thus grew to become probably one of the largest of any Greek polis , though its precise extension is conjectural (Laronde ( 1987 ) 15 ). The total area available for cultivation in Greek Libya depended on the rainfall (cf. Laronde ( 1987 ) 15 -17 and figs. 1 -3 ) and has been variously calculated: even a lower estimate of 16 , 100 km ² corresponds to about three-quarters of the area of the Peloponnese or twice that of Crete (Laronde ( 1987 ) 15 and 340 ). The territory under the direct control of Kyrene consisted of a central inner core measuring about 50 × 35 km, i.e. 1 , 750 km ² (Laronde ( 1987 ) 285 -93 with fig. 87 ), where a scattered population depended directly on the urban centre, and further away a zone of nucleated villages (Laronde ( 1987 ) 293 -313 with fig. 108 ). About a quarter of the territory of Kyrene was occupied by Libyans (Laronde ( 1987 ) 313 ). Kyrene claimed a pre-eminent position in Libya as the mother city of the other Greek foundations there (Barke (no. 1025 ), Eu(h)esperides (no. 1026 ), Taucheira (no. 1029 )), though she was frequently in conflict with them. The Battiads sought to restore control over Barke after its foundation, and eventually invited Persian intervention to punish the rebellious city (Hdt. 4 . 164 . 3 -65 , 167 , 200 -4 ). Arkesilas IV is addressed by Pindar as 'king of cities' (Pind. Pyth . 5 . 15 ); he sent colonists to Eu(h)esperides, which he made into a place of refuge (Theotimos of Kyrene ( FGrHist 470 ) fr. 1 (second century ad ?); Chamoux ( 1953 ) 173 -75 ), and was eventually killed there (Heracl. Lemb. 17 = Arist. fr. 611 , Rose). But Kyrene's relationship with the Greek cities in Libya was not translated into constitutional forms. The political interpretation of the so-called alliance coinages of C5s is unclear (see under Barke, Eu(h)esperides, Taucheira). A federation of Greek cities in Libya in C4 has been postulated on the basis of a passage in the 'Stele of the ΣΥΛΑ ' ( SEG 20716 . 8 -9 ; cf. Oliviero et al . ( 1961 -62 ) 273 -80 ), but this seems doubtful (Laronde ( 1987 ) 156 ). Kyrene maintained from earliest days close relations with the mainland of Greece and the Aegean world (for C4 cf. Laronde ( 1987 ) 137 -68 ). But politically she played no part in the major conflicts and alliances of the mainland. The political and constitutional history of Kyrene divides into two periods: the monarchy down to the end of the Battiads c. 440 , and the establishment of a republican form of government down to Alexander. The Aristotelian collection of politeiai included a Kyrenaion Politeia (Heracl.Lemb. 16 -17 ; Arist. frr. 535 -38 ). Thera (no. 527 ) at the time of the foundation of Kyrene was herself under a basileus (Hdt. 4 . 150 . 2 -3 ; Malkin ( 1994 ) 113 -14 ), and Kyrene adopted the institutions of her mother city. Hence Battos, ⁹ the oikistes , was at the same time basileus , and founded a hereditary dynasty that lasted eight generations (cf. Hdt. 4 . 163 . 2 ; for the designation basileus cf. Hdt. 4 . 153 ; Pind. Pyth. 4 . 2 , 62 , 5 . 15 ). The monarch was probably from the start the priest of Apollo (Chamoux ( 1953 ) 217 -19 ). Battos the founder received after his death a heroic cult at his tomb in the agora of Kyrene (Pind. Pyth . 5 . 93 -95 ; Leschhorn ( 1984 ) 60 -72 ; Malkin ( 1987 ) 204 -16 ). As Kyrene grew,the monarch's position was increasingly challenged.In the reign of Battos II a large-scale influx of new settlers changed the political and social balance (Hdt. 4 . 159 ). Conflict broke out within the dynasty itself in the reign of Arkesilas II (Hdt. 4 . 160 ). This necessitated the intervention in the reign of Battos III of the arbitrator Demonax of ⁹ He is called Aristoteles by Pind. Pyth . 5 . 87 and other sources, a name unknown to Herodotos; on this problem, cf. Chamoux ( 1953 ) 95 -98 ; Malkin ( 1987 ) 63 . Mantinea. He handed over the powers of the basileus to the demos , while leaving him only temene and priesthoods (Hdt. 4 . 161 . 3 ; Chamoux ( 1953 ) 138 -42 ; E. W. Robinson ( 1997 ) 105 -8 ). The history of the dynasty thereafter was a long struggle by the rulers (Arkesilas III and his mother Pheretime) to restore their lost power against internal opposition, first with support from the Greek world (Hdt. 4 . 162 -64 ), then thanks to Persian intervention (Hdt. 4 . 165 , 167 , 200 -5 ; Austin ( 1990 ) 301 -2 ). Arkesilas IV was eventually killed at Eu(h)esperides, and the monarchy came to an end c. 440 (Chamoux ( 1953 ) 202 -9 ; cf. Bacchielli ( 1985 )). The government which followed was classified as a 'democracy' by Arist. Pol . 1319 b 15 -27 and Heracl. Lemb. 17 , Arist. fr. 611 , Rose); however, according to Laronde ( 1987 ) it was more likely republican in character ( 27 ), though dominated by a wealthy aristocracy ( 129 -36 ). There were further internal conflicts down to the age of Alexander (cf. Diod. 14 . 34 . 3 -6 ( 401 ); Arist. Pol . 1319 b 1 -27 ; cf. Laronde ( 1987 ) 249 -56 ). From the evidence of some inscribed sherds it seems possible that Kyrene used the institution of ostracism in C5l (Bacchielli ( 1994 )). In 331 Kyrene sent an embassy to Alexander to ask for his friendship (Diod. 17 . 49 . 3 ; Curt. 4 . 7 . 8 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 28 -30 , 35 -36 ). After his death the mercenary captain Thibron intervened at the invitation of exiles (Diod. 18 . 19 -21 ; App. ( FGrHist 156 ) fr. 9 §§ 16 -19 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 41 -84 ). His defeat and death eventually provoked the intervention of Ptolemy I, who imposed a settlement on Kyrene, recorded in a long inscription (the diagramma ) of probably 322 / 1 ( SEG 9 1 ) which sheds much light on the constitution of Kyrene before this time. After the end of the monarchy, the priesthood of Apollo became an eponymous magistracy (cf. SEG 9 11 -13 etc.; Chamoux ( 1953 ) 217 , 301 -2 ; Sherk ( 1992 ) 270 -72 ). The diagramma of Ptolemy I specifies a minimum age of 50 ( SEG 9 1 . 25 ; list of known priests in Oliviero et al . ( 1961 -62 ) 359 -75 ). The temene of the monarchy probably then became public property, administered by a body of three damiergoi whose functions are illustrated by a series of inscriptions of C4 -C2 ( SEG 9 11 -44 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 156 -57 , 325 -34 ; Chamoux ( 1988 ); Sherk ( 1992 ) 270 -72 ). A body of 101 gerontes is first attested in 322 / 1 ( SEG 9 1 . 20 -23 ). They are found also in a proxeny decree of Eu(h)esperides of C4s ( SEG 18 772 . 1 -2 ; cf. SEG 41 1693 ), and are likely to have existed in some form since the early history of Kyrene. A building of C4 on the west side of the agora has been identified as the chamber for their meetings (Laronde ( 1987 ) 176 -77 ; but see Goodchild ( 1971 ) 98 ). Ephors are likely to have existed from an early date, as part of Kyrene's Theran-Spartan inheritance (Chamoux ( 1953 ) 214 -16 ). Heraclid. Pont. ( FHG ii 212 ; Arist. fr. 611 . 115 -17 , Rose) mentions their judicial powers. They were five in number in 322 / 1 ( SEG 9 1 . 33 ; cf. 82 -84 ). Strategoi are first attested in C4 by dedications put up by them ( SEG 9 76 , 77 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 52 -53 with fig. 10 , 66 -69 , 104 , 178 , 199 , 207 ). Lists of soldiers of C4 also mention lochagoi ( SEG 9 46 . 13 , 49 . 1 -2 , 50 . 32 , 51 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 131 -34 ). Kyrene is likely to have had a boule in addition to gerontes and ephors (cf. Eu(h)esperides). Pheretime, the mother of Arkesilas III, is presented by Hdt. 4 . 165 . 1 as sitting in the boule , but the reference could be to the gerousia (cf. Chamoux ( 1953 ) 216 ). A stoa built in C4 in the north-west corner of the agora has been identified as a chamber for the meetings of the boule (Stucchi ( 1975 ) 65 ; cf. Laronde ( 1987 ) 175 -76 ). A boule of 500 men appointed by lot and over the age of 50 is specified in 322 / 1 ( SEG 9 1 . 16 -19 , 34 -35 ). An assembly of the people is presupposed as existing already at Thera in C7 in the Oath of the Founders (ML 5 . 24 ), but this may be anachronistic. The C4 decree on citizenship for Thera was passed by the demos (ML 5 . 11 ; cf. Laronde ( 1987 ) 250 ). Kyrene was almost certainly named in a C4list of theorodokoi for the Argive Heraia ( SEG 23 189 ( c. 330 ) i ll. 16 -19 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 161 -62 ; Charneux in BE ( 1988 ) no. 595 ). In C5l a citizen of Kyrene was granted proxenia by Athens (no. 361 ) ( IG ii² 174 ). Competitors from Kyrene were very prominent in the major Panhellenic festivals (Pind. Pyth. 4 , 5 , 9 for the Pythian Games, with Chamoux ( 1953 ) 169 -201 ; Paus. 6 . 12 . 7 for the Isthmian Games; Olympionikai 194 , 257 , 268 , 269 , 347 , 421 , 423 , 428 , 430 , 442 , 508 , 990 for the Olympic Games;and see generally Laronde ( 1987 ) 146 -47 ). In C4l, the city dedicated a treasury at Delphi (Bommelaer ( 1991 ) 155 -58 ). The site of Kyrene lies inland some 12 . 5 km from its harbour (Apollonia) in a straight line. ¹⁰ It was built on a large hill with two peaks in the west and the east at 620 m, and strong natural defences to the south (the Wadi Bel Gadir) and the north (the Wadi Bu Turkia). The suburban approaches to the city from the north were used as a large necropolis, and other cemeteries were also located around the city (Chamoux ( 1953 ) 287 -300 ; Cassels ( 1955 ); Goodchild ( 1971 ) 165 -71 ). The city consisted of four main areas. ( 1 ) The acropolis on the western peak had no public buildings (Goodchild ( 1971 ) 104 -8 ), and it is not clear whether it was used as a residence by the Battiads. ¹¹ ¹⁰ On the routes of approach to Kyrene cf. Stucchi ( 1985 ). ¹¹ Cf. Hansen and Fischer-Hansen ( 1994 ) 27 against Chamoux ( 1953 ) 260 ; cf. 217 , 310 . ( 2 ) The civic centre of the agora, slightly below the acropolis to the south-east, grew in time with the addition of new buildings (Stucchi ( 1965 ); Goodchild ( 1971 ) 91 -103 with fig. 7 ; Vickers and Reynolds ( 1972 ) 33 -34 ; Bacchielli ( 1981 ); Laronde ( 1987 ) 169 -78 with fig. 48 for C4 ). By C4 it had four stoas (Stucchi ( 1975 ) 31 -34 , 63 -65 ; Coulton ( 1976 ) 228 , 230 -31 with fig. 59 ), but the identification of many of the public buildings and sanctuaries remains disputed, including the location of the heroon of Battos the founder, the bouleuterion , geronteion , prytaneion (the latter attested in SEG 9 1 . 44 of 322 / 1 ; cf. Miller ( 1978 ) 183 -84 , 227 ), and the sanctuaries of Apollo and Demeter. In C4 a monumental altar of Apollo was built in the agora, similar to that in front of his temple (Stucchi ( 1975 ) 59 -60 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 175 ). ( 3 ) The eastern peak was chosen as the location for the sanctuary of Zeus Lykaios (plan with site index in Goodchild ( 1971 ) facing p. 200 ). Hdt. 4 . 203 . 2 implies that the latter was originally outside the city perimeter. In C6l under Battos IV Zeus Lykaios was identified with the Egyptian god Amon who achieved great status at Kyrene (cf. coin types), from where his cult spread to the Greek world (Chamoux ( 1953 ) 320 -41 with pls. XIX, XXVII-XXVIII; Goodchild ( 1971 ) 149 -55 ; Stucchi ( 1975 ) 19 -20 , 23 -29 ; Bisi ( 1985 )). His temple,made of local limestone,was built at some time during C6s-C5s, the largest Greek temple in Libya, comparable in size to the Parthenon at Athens and the temple of Zeus at Olympia. Traces of two other sanctuaries have been found on the eastern hill in addition to the temple of Zeus (Stucchi in Goodchild ( 1971 ) 155 -56 ). ( 4 ) A paved street led down from the acropolis via the agora to the terrace of the sanctuary of Apollo, to the northnorth-east of the acropolis and on a lower level than the agora (Goodchild ( 1971 ) 109 -28 with fig. 13 ). A temple of C6 ascribed to Battos the founder (Pind. Pyth . 5 . 89 ; Callim. Hymn 2 . 75 -79 ; SEG 9 189 ) was rebuilt in C4 on a larger scale (Chamoux ( 1953 ) 203 , 304 -8 ; Goodchild ( 1971 ) 116 -19 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 104 -5 , 178 -79 ). A monumental altar in front of the temple was also renovated in C4s ( SEG 9 85 , 86 ; Chamoux ( 1953 ) 308 -9 ; Goodchild ( 1971 ) 116 ; Stucchi ( 1975 ) 29 , 58 -59 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 110 -13 ). The sacred spring near the sanctuary was dedicated to the god (Pind. Pyth . 4 . 294 ; Hdt. 4 . 158 . 3 ; Chamoux ( 1953 ) 77 -82 , 126 -27 ; Goodchild ( 1971 ) 109 -12 ).Artemis was closely associated with Apollo from the start (Chamoux ( 1953 ) 311 -20 with pls. XVII-XVIII; Goodchild ( 1971 ) 127 -28 ; Stucchi ( 1975 ) 8 -9 , 48 -49 , 58 ). Her temple, immediately to the north of the temple of Apollo and with a C6monumental altar in front of it, was also reconstructed in C4 . The terrace received substantial additions subsequently, notably in C4 (Laronde ( 1987 ) 178 -92 with fig. 54 ). A small treasure was built there by the strategoi in C4s to commemorate victories over the Libyans ( SEG 9 89 -90 ; Goodchild ( 1971 ) 113 -14 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 104 -5 with fig. 29 ). T o the west of the sanctuary of Apollo a theatre ( TGR iii. 137 ) was constructed, partly excavated in the hill, though the date of initial construction is uncertain (Goodchild ( 1971 ) 125 -27 ; Stucchi ( 1975 ) 34 -36 , 69 -70 ). Outside the city, on a terraced site across the Wadi Bel Gadir, lay the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore, in an isolated position opposite the agora and about 75 m south of the city's wall circuit. It was established by C6e and had a continuous history till Roman times, as shown by numerous votive offerings (White ( 1981 ), ( 1984 -93 )). The city wall was gradually developed (detailed description for C4l in Laronde ( 1987 ) 71 -76 with figs. 19 -22 ), and by the early Heltic period enclosed both peaks, with a total length of 5 , 560 m and an enclosed area of about 750 ha. The acropolis was separately fortified in C4l (Diod. 19 . 79 . 1 ). Kyrene was besieged in 322 (Diod. 18 . 19 . 4 ). Only about one-third of the area enclosed by the city walls was inhabited. Estimates of the size of the urban population depend on the density of settlement assumed, and thus vary considerably from c. 30 , 000 (Goodchild ( 1971 ) 15 ) to as much as 100 , 000 or more (Laronde ( 1987 ) 342 , discussing other estimates). A settlement density of 100 -300 per ha (Jameson et al . ( 1994 ), 542 -43 ; cf. Hansen ( 1997 c ) 28 -30 ) would indicate an urban population in the range 25 , 000 -75 , 000 . The coinage of Kyrene provided the models for the coinages of the other Greek cities of Libya. It went through three main phases: c. 570 -480 , c. 480 -435 and c. 435 -308 (see BMC Cyrenaica ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 233 -48 ; SNG Cop. Suppl . 1330 ). The earliest coinage ( BMC Cyrenaica pp. xviii-xxxvi and 1 -9 ) was in silver on the Euboic-Attic standard, at first tetradrachms, didrachms and drachms and later fractional denominations as well. Types: obv . silphium plant or fruit, which remained the distinctive obverse type at Kyrene; ¹² rev . at first incuse, later animals, then anthropomorphic types. In the second period ( BMC Cyrenaica pp. xxxvi-xlvii and 10 -14 ) the Asiatic standard mostly took over from the Attic, and types became more standardized, and the head of Amon was introduced as the normal reverse type. In the third period ( BMC Cyrenaica pp.xlvii-xcviii and 15 -47 ), the names of magistrates appear on a number of gold and silver ¹² On the silphium plant cf. BMC Cyrenaica pp. ccli-cclvii; Chamoux ( 1953 ) 246 -63 and in Barker et al . ( 1985 ). coins, but are not found on the bronze coins which were introduced in the latter part of the period (C4l). In the latter part of the period there are also numerous gold issues on the Attic standard with a greater variety of types (on these see also Naville ( 1951 ); Laronde ( 1987 ) 208 -11 , 239 -40 ). Legends appear late in the first period, with the city-ethnic, which becomes common,mostly abbreviated, sometimes down to ΚΥ but occasionally in the full form ΚΥΡΑΝΑΙΟΝ . On the C5s 'alliance' coinage, see under Barke (no. 1025 ) and Eu(h)esperides (no. 1026 )."

The toponym is Ταυacuteχειρα or Τευacuteχειρα , and other variants are found (testimonia in Purcaro Pagano ( 1976 ) 347 -48 ). Ταυacuteχειρα is the earliest attested form, and it continued to be used in the post-Classical period (Hdt. 4 . 171 ; Ps.-Skylax 108 ). Τευacuteχειρα appears not to be found till the Roman Empire (Arr. Diadochi ( FGrHist 156 ) fr. 9 § 17 ; Hippol. Chron . § 300 l. 1 (second century ad )); the letters ΤΕ , however, are found on the obverse of some C5s coins issued jointly by Barke and Taucheira ( BMC Cyrenaica pp. clxxxvi-clxxxvii and 107 -8 ). This latter form of the toponym is not mentioned anywhere by Steph. Byz. Other forms are also found, as Ταυacuteχιρα , Τευacuteχηρα and Τευacuteχιρα . The gender of the toponym was treated as either feminine singular (Strabo; Procopius) or neuter plural (Hdt.; Diod. 18 . 20 . 6 ; Hippol.). In C3 under the Ptolemies Taucheira was renamed Arsinoe (Laronde ( 1987 ) 382 -83 ), but the original name survived, as shown by references in post-Classical sources (e.g. Strabo 17 . 3 . 20 ; Plin. HN 5 . 32 ). The city-ethnic is rarely attested. Steph. Byz. 608 . 20 -609 . 1 gives several versions: Ταυχείριος , Ταυχέριος , Ταυacuteχερος , Ταυχερίτης . Of these, only Ταυχέριος seems to be attested in a literary source (Parthenius frr. 45 . 1 and 662 . 1 (C1 )). Not mentioned by Steph. Byz. is the form Τευχειρῖται found in Arr. Diadochi ( FGrHist 156 ) fr. 9 § 18 (r 322 ). Taucheira is first referred to as a polis (in the urban sense) by Hdt. 4 . 171 . Ps.-Skylax describes it as only a χωρίον , while Strabo, who calls it a polis at 17 . 3 . 20 , lists it at 17 . 3 . 21 among the περιπόλια of Kyrene (no. 1028 ), which he describes as πολίχνια . It is also described as a polis in the urban sense by Diod. 18 . 20 . 6 and in the political sense by Arrian ( FGrHist 156 ) fr. 9 § 17 (both r 322 ). The collective use of the city-ethnic internally is attested (abbreviated as ΤΕ ) by some coins of Taucheira issued together with Barke. Little is heard of Taucheira in the Archaic and Classical periods. It was reportedly founded by Kyrene, at an unspec- ified date (schol. Pind. Pyth. 4 . 26 ). Archaeological evidence of Greek presence there goes back to C7l (Boardman ( 1966 ) 153 -55 ; Boardman and Hayes ( 1966 ) 12 -15 , 170 ; Boardman ( 1994 ) 143 -46 ), and its foundation is likely to have preceded that of Barke (no. 1025 ). The extent of Taucheira's territory is unknown, though it was probably much more limited than that of Kyrene or Barke (see Laronde ( 1987 ) 59 -63 , ( 1994 ) 25 , 27 -28 who estimates the arable land potentially available at 250 km ² , which could sustain a population of more than 20 , 000 ). Situated on the coast, Taucheira was overshadowed by Barke inland to the east, and in C5 it was in some sense subordinated to her (cf. Hdt. 4 . 171 and the evidence of the so-called alliance coinage). To the south-west its possibilities of expansion were restricted by Eu(h)esperides as well as by Libyan tribes. In the war of Thibron against Kyrene in 322 , Taucheira was in alliance with Kyrene (no. 1028 ), while Barke (no. 1025 ) and Eu(h)esperides (no. 1026 ) sided with him; but it was captured by Thibron (Diod. 18 . 20 . 6 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 42 , 49 , 63 ). There is no evidence regarding the political institutions of Taucheira and little regarding its cults. Votive material from a sanctuary of Demeter and Kore has been found (Boardman and Hayes ( 1966 ) 11 -12 , 15 ; Boardman ( 1994 ) 143 -46 ). A temple of Dionysos is reported from the centre of Taucheira, but no further details are available (Laronde ( 1987 ) 335 ). It is not clear whether Taucheira was named in a catalogue of theorodokoi of the Heraia at Argos (no. 347 ) ( SEG 23 189 ( c. 330 ), i ll. 16 -19 ; Laronde ( 1987 ) 161 -62 ; Charneux in BE ( 1988 ) no. 595 ). Traces of what may be a C6e circuit wall have been found (Boardman and Hayes ( 1966 ) 9 -10 , 13 ; Boardman ( 1994 ) 144 ; cf. Smith and Crow ( 1998 ) 37 ), and Thibron's siege and capture of Taucheira in 322 implies that it had a wall at the time (Diod. 18 . 20 . 6 ). It is not clear whether the urban remains of Taucheira, with traces of a city wall, can be dated to before the Heltic period (Laronde ( 1987 ) 59 -61 ). The city perimeter as fixed in C3m enclosed an area of 40 ha and an urban population at the time estimated at a minimum of 6 , 000 (Laronde ( 1994 ) 27 -28 ). The only known coinage of Taucheira consists of an issue of C5s of silver tetradrachms (Attic standard) and drachmas (Asiatic standard). It has been described as an 'alliance' coinage, as the coins bear the city-ethnic of Taucheira (in the form ΤΕ ) on the obverse and Barke (no. 1025 ) on the reverse.

1031,(Erodioi),Unlocated,,,151,682,"1031 . (Erodioi) Unlocated. Not in Barr . Type: C. The ethnic is ' Ερόδιος , attested in IG i³ 263 . iv . 18 , which is the only source we have for this community. The ethnic is almost completely restored in the list of 454 / 3 ( IG i³ 259 . ii . 8 : ' Ε [ ροδιοι ]). Thus,the only thing we know is that the Erodioi were members of the Delian League and that in 450 / 49 they paid a phoros of 500 dr. ( IG i³ 263 . iv . 18 ). They are listed after Astakos in Propontis and Stolos in Chalkidike ( iv . 16 -17 ) and before the islands of Tenos and Siphnos ( iv . 19 -20 ). There is no foundation for the suggestion in ATL i. 485 that the Erodioi should be located somewhere in Thrace."

In both cases we find the sequence: Dikaia (in Thrace), the Dieis (on Euboia), the Eurymachitai (unlocated), the Brykontioi (on Karpathos, which belonged to the Karian district) and, probably, the Kioi (in the Hellespontine district)."

Because of the types, Head believes that this unidentified community was somewhere in the neighbourhood of Maroneia. He may be right, but, to be on the safe side, it is better placed here among the unlocated poleis ."
